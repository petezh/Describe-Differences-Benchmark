I'm about to use coke for the first time.  It tastes bitter and numbs the tongue in a funny way.", "I'm REALLY nervous.  After all, this is COKE.  OK, I'll just do it now...  I did it... How much time will it take before it does anything?", "I'm not sure I feel anything.  Although I suspect something's just around the corner...  I feel the coke going down my throat.  It's rather unpleasant, just like when something you're drinking gets to your nose.", "I don't feel hungry anymore.  I'm gonna take a second line to see if anything happens then.", "I cut two other lines.  I'm taking them.  One's in.  In the right nostril, just like the first one.", "OK, the third one's in the left nostril.  At least half of it.  I finished the second half with my right nostril.  This smells/feels synthetic.", "OK, I think I'll just wait and see now.  All my palate and teeth feel numb.  Is this really coke?  I don't feel euphoria.", "I think I've been fucked.  Because I don't feel any euphoria and to tell the truth, I even feel a bit paranoid that I might have taken something bad for me.  My perception is slightly altered.  I wouldn't say it is hightened.  The pseudo-feeling I get somehow ressembles the one I'd get off of pot, only weaker.  I think I might have gotten PCP or some crap like that instead of coke.", "I don't know.  This doesn't seem really great.  I definitely have a ping, though.  I think my heartbeat's faster and that I'm affected in some way.  My mouth's gone from frighteningly numb to simply numb.  Should I take this experiment all the way and use a large quantity of coke?  The feeling of 'mental precipitation' somehow ressembles that of acid:  it seems to make you unfocused and prone to make more mistakes (typos for instance).", "I've been trying to find a chat room where I could ask people about coke for the past few minutes.", "I have found that cocaine is not for me.  I read some info on websites that says some people feel anxious and really don't enjoy coke.  I guess I'm one of them.", "Some time ago, looking for a way of using cocaine inside a disco, I've confronted with the idea of mixing it with physiological saline solution (NaCl 0,9%), inside a nasal descongestant tube. It worked actually very well, altough your nose get really really more 'off', and it's less harsh on your respiratory tract. I cannot determine if it is more or less potent than inhaling the powder directly, but it's more practical for using in public places.", "The powder can be dissolved on it's own, or, melted, dissolved then put into the microwave for around 5 seconds to improve the dissolution. It actually worked for me, but I've only tried that once, for now.", "[Erowid Note: There are many varieties of over-the-counter nasal sprays.  Some contain active ingredients while others are only water and salt (saline solution).  Cocaine should not be mixed with unknown active ingredients.  It should also be noted that the damage Cocaine does to the nasal tissues might well be lessened by snorting liquid instead of powder. Sometimes a few drops of ethanol (drinking alcohol) is used to increase the solubility of cocaine in water.]", "I am a frequent cocaine user.  Usually every friday night and sometimes saturdays too.  I use minimum of a gram a week but maximum of two.  I have never had a bad experience on cocaine.  I spent two days snorting a line every half hour while walking the streets with a friend and drinking black coffee.  I have never felt so beautiful, smart, funny, and happy in my life.  I was chatting up everyone I met.  ", "The key to using cocaine is to become aware of what your body is telling you so that you know when you are ready for more or when to stop.  That way you maximize your cocaine experience and become the fun loving, confident person you are meant to be.  Don't forget that if you haven't used it before to take it slowly and be VERY careful.  If you respect the drug for what harm it can bring you and use it carefully you can have many years of happy, healthy cocaine abuse.  : )", "I am writing on behalf of my father.  He is 47 years old and was the President of a publishing company.  He is addicted to cocaine.", "I noticed several years ago that he was acting very strange.  He would be happy, then enraged.  He would make endless promises that he would never keep.  I have a young son who has never really known my father because when he did see him, my father could care less.  This was a man who believed that family came first.  He saved his money and was very successful.  After he started using cocaine, he became all of the things he hated.  ", "My 15 year old sister lived with him and she became addicted. They would do 4-5 lines at a time and race to see who would finish first. She started skipping school, and he started skipping work.  This man had not missed a day of work in 20 years, yet he started skipping every Thursday and Friday.", "Last year, my father called and said that his house was raided by the police.  He was convicted of 7 felony charges and sentenced to 4 years in prison.  He was released early and is currently in a halfway house.  He will be on probation for 3 1/2 years.  He lost most of his money, his brand new van, many friends and most importantly his pride.  ", "Dad said that cocaine made him feel happy, invincible and sexual. He was also convicted of trying to have his way with some of my sister's friends.  He will be registered as a sex offender for 10 years.  His whole life has changed.  My whole life is changed.  I have my own family, yet I take care of his house, his finances and him. ", "Cocaine is something my father claims he will never touch again.  I most certainly hope so.  He says he will give presentations to others about the harm it causes, so I am hoping it will change someone else's life.  It has changed mine forever.  Cocaine doesn't just affect the person who is using--it affects everyone in the family.  ", "This drug has taken a man who had everything to a man who has nothing.  Thank God he is still alive.  Cocaine does not discriminate as far as addiction is concerned.  It affects every gender, every race, every socio-economic status and every age.  My father is not alone in his fight against the addiction, but he will always have to live with the consequences of his actions.  I believe that it is a terrible drug, and if you try it, be prepared to hurt the ones you love and ruin your life.", "My friend hooked me up with cocaine just before a show.  I did about 2 lines before & 5 more during.  Needless to say it was great.  I got home at around 3:00 and the effects continued until 4:30 after with I suffered the shittiest comedown I've had with any drug.  Until around 7:00 I was clawing at the sheets, gnawing my teeth and staring longingly at ceiling like the Gate Keeper.", "Another club.  In the bathroom stall, I dumped a bunch of it on my lap, and the only way to stand up without losing da schtuff was to perform an act similar to giving myself head, but with my nose.  The result was too much too fast.  The rest of the evening I had to keep drinking water in order to be be able to swallow and my teeth felt like dentures (I ended up chipping one of them with a beer bottle).  I then had an anxiety attack and rushed to the bathroom stall where I found by nose bleeding and that I couldn't open my hands all the way.  Other than that ... euphoria.  I snuck out to avoid all the undercover cops who had surely been observing me all evening and I somehow lost them by taking a winding way home.", "By this time I was convinced that coke was evil.  I had some left over, and I felt bad about tossing it and I had no one to sell it to, so I kept it around for a week or two.  The idea of having coke in the house haunted me for a while, so when I was bummed out over having to clean my room, I downed a line.  Beautiful.  No side effects, no comedown and one hospital-clean room.  I finished the coke one or two lines a day and eventually the whole house was sparkling and my mom wondered what had come over me, and whatever it was, where could she get some more?", "I have no yearning for more and I never think about it but if some turns up than I'm all the happier.", "I started out on pot when I was about 15. I was never one of those people to say, 'I'll never try anything else but pot.' I wanted to try other stuff before I started smokin' herb.", "I tried acid, E, hash and some other stuff, but never got hooked. I'm really good at quitting bad habits, even cigarettes, which were harder to quit than E. Anyway, it started when I was 16 years old. I was a virgin, and as any horny teenage guy, could not pass up an opportunity for sex. A girl I knew said she had some E, if I wanted to fuck while on it. I never had sex on E, actually I'd never had sex, so I said okay.", "I went to her house, and of course, her being a cokehead, she changed her mind (or did she?). She said she would rather do it on coke. I really didn't want to do coke, but how could I resist? I wasn't one of those horny 16 year olds who would screw anything - this girl was really hot. So, we bought about $20 worth each, and snorted straight out of the bag. I was feeling great! Usually, I'm a pretty shy, mellow guy, but this stuff made me like an animal! I hit that coochie like a monkey on crack.", "After my first lay (which on coke lasted about 40 minutes), I started coming down. I figured, wow, I need a cigarette after this. But I didn't have any. So she asked wouldn't another bag be better than a pack of cigs? Sure, it would! I bought another sack, and we smoked a blunt, and later at night we got drunk and smoked another blunt.", "The next morning I woke up with morning wood, and an unusual correlation between blueballs and a need to snort. But I was feeling too goddam sick to go and buy more coke, so I called her the next week, and went another round. The thing is, this time, when I snorted, the shit hurt my nose. I didn't think much of it, or the fact that the high was not as strong, but lasted longer, so I went along with it. The next day her friend told me it was E. Damn! I needed some coke. E is way too weak. A week later, I called again, but I remembered she went to Jersey. So, I looked around asking my weed dealers if they knew where I could get some coke. 'Man, we don't deal with that shit. Do we look like drug dealers to you?' True, I can't really say a weed dealer is anything like a drug dealer. Oh well.", "So, there I was, two weeks without coke. I called all week long even though I knew she wasn't home. I went to her house the next week, we got more coke and screwed again. The next day, I wanted more. But, I had to go with my parents to my brother-in-law's parents' house. Believe me, I was pissed. But after hearing their discussion about how their uncle OD'd on coke, I was touched. I vowed to quit. Although the next week I felt horny and called her, she said that her b/f was back, whom I didn't even know existed....", "Since then, I never snorted a line again. But I can't say I never think about it. And every time I have sex, I think how it is just okay, it would be a million times better on coke.", "I used to always be against hard drugs such as cocaine. I stuck to weed and alcohol; I did acid twice, but that was a real weird experience.  When people would do coke around me, I would always look bad upon them.  My friends started doing it, and one time they convinced me to do just one line, so I did.  It didn't feel too great, because it was a small one, except for the burst of energy.", "The next weekend I wanted to do more, and we did about 6 lines each.  I was so torn up, it felt good for like a good half hour, and then pretty much knocked me off my ass.  We did some more, and I loved it.  Ever since then, I think I'm hooked. It feels so good to take those lines up my nose. I want to stop and I'm not into it that much yet, but I have a feeling that I want it all the time, and when I don't get it it's like the worst feeling in the world.", "I hope I'm not addicted...but I think it's too late.", "The first time that I tried cocaine I was 23 years old and at the local bar with some friends. We had gotten out of work and were ready to have some drinks. I have a BA degree and consider myself fairly educated, but Cocaine I had no prior experiance or knowledge of the drug other than it was another drug.", "Inside the busy bar my friend and his girlfriend turned to me and said, 'do you want to do some coke' looking them dead in the eye, they somehow convinced me to give it a try.", "The three of us headed out to his car we piled in and his girlfriend cut up three lines on a CD case and we railed (snorted) them up with a 'toot': a rolled up dollar.", "I felt the burn inside my nostril, and an accute awarness came over me. I felt my alcohol 'wear off' I felt very sober and coherent. I didn't mind the drip.", "Despite the irritating running nose when we returned into the bar. I was feeling great. My mind was fully aware of my surroundings and the people around me. Over the next few hours we snorted up what I learned to be about 2 grams. The girl that I was seeing at the time, came home with me to sleep with me. I was a stud I knew everything to say and everything to do. I was so alert to her body and movements.  Then when the moment for sex came, and I learned the major downer of cocaine. It took about a half hour for me to produce an erection.", "After this Cocaine became a weekend experiance for me, this went on for about two months. I also began to dabble into Extacy, from a local pharmacist, I stopped seeing the girl that went home with me the first night, and spent most of my time with my friends.", "After three months of weekend use I began binging with my friends inviting people who wanted to do Cocaine up to the City for a little Cocaine. The average bing was only two to three days. I began to purchase large quantities through my friend, and then my dealer made himself known to me he was an average guy someone who I would talk to at work all the time, The Average Joe with everything going for him like me.", "At that time I was spliting 60 dollars a gram with my friends every weekend or roughly two times a month guaranteed. After meeting the dealer, I would purchace a few grams, and during the purchase, I would kick him a line, up until that night in his car I had never portioned out lines before. I didn't know how much to give him let alone me. Obviously I was a heavy pour, each line was about a quarter gram, I believe now. With each purchace I made the price began going down.", "It finally came to the point that the dealer and I hung out, and he cut me into his deal. I purchace a 1/2 ounce of good cocaine for 600 dollars, @ 45 dollars a gram. Out of this I sell close to 14 grams and keep two for myself.", "I am a normal guy with a job and friends, I have an education and a great future ahead of me. I grew up in the average home, with good parents.", "This is my story and I just finished a gram today while writing this. I am finished using and finished selling as of this moment.", "Albatross, a seller, a user, not an addict by choice.", "Up until a year or so ago I along with most of my friends thought of cocaine as an evil force which could send you spiraling into addiction and worse. But then I began to think how I had approached cannabis. For years I had steered clear of dope but once I had tried it I found I could control it with ease and use it to my own advantage. So why should coke not be the same.", "One afternoon I was at a friend's house when he produced a bag of cocaine and offered me a line. I was instinctively wary of taking it but then remembered how I had reasoned it out to myself and decided to join in. I did a fairly large line in each nostril and smeared what was left all over my gums. For 5 or 10 minutes there was nothing, but then it kicked in. The numbness spread all over the roof of my mouth and soon I was away. Suddenly I was talking like there was no tomorrow and the feeling of confidence and arrogance was overwhelming. But when I came down there was no longing for more. Had some been at hand I would have taken it but there was no desire to walk the streets in search of a dealer.", "There then came a long gap of about 10 months with no coke. The next opportunity was after a night out clubbing. I had taken some MDMA (A Mitsubishi to be precise) but had not come up at all. Then after the club, we agreed to go to a friend's room to get a gram of coke. We got there and got stuck in, snorting up a good big line each. We set off for home but were already flying. We stopped off in our college library to do some lines of the tables, by now we were on the top of the world and being caught was not an issue. We were away, all talking at once and all believing that we were the fountains of world knowledge. Having started the night at about 10:30 PM we found ourselves still buzzing at 9 AM.", "That night was a bit of a binge but I continue to use cocaine. A couple of lines during a night of joint smoking always helps make the night a really good one as coke can really bring out the effects of other drugs. I am pretty sure I am in no way addicted as I never really crave at all, but this could be the result of a strange ability my family seem to have to not become addicted to anything, cigarettes, alcohol, whatever. This seems to make cocaine an ideal, if not a tad expensive drug. I can see that it could cause problems but I think as with any drug, so long as you treat it with some sort of reverence then it should be fine.", "i used to use coke, socially, at first. a friend and i would get some blow on the weekends and spend our time drinking and doing lines. i remember the euphoria. it made me feel powerful, beautiful, and i secretly enjoyed the ", "ritual preparation of cutting lines. most of my friends used and it was relatively accepted in our group. ", "i started using in my late teens, but as i matured and began to question who i was and why i do the things i do i began to feel very guilty about my coke use. i realised that the person i wanted to become didn't include the use of drugs and alcohol. ", "at about this time the friend i was using with was using way more frequently and a whole lot more. all the basic signs of addiction were apparant. she began hanging out with other people. i decided that if i were to stop i'd need to stop hanging with her. but my use didn't end at that. although i didn't see her anymore i still had a hard time saying no to offers when i was drinking in bars. addiction? habit? caught it in time? i don't know. all i know is i liked the high, but i had to stop. ", "i haven't used in almost two years. i'm now dating a crack addict! ironic or what! it's a painful ride, but now i know how my ex was feeling when i was using. it's a sick habit that lies to you. it makes you believe you're invinsable. the only reason i think it affected me as it did is a lack of self-esteem. now i'm clearer in my thinking and of who i am. i feel better about myself(that took work) and this drug doesn't fit into my life anymore. to all of you out there who continue to use... the answer lies within you not within the dope.", "Cocaine truly is one of the most deceiving drugs I have ever come in contact with, it gives you a feeling of being great or even greatness. It is a very egotistical drug that makes most people I know arrogant assholes, myself included on a number of occasions.", "After taking cocaine on and off for the last 4 months or so I truly believe it is a nasty substance, not in its natural plant form but rock or powdered form. The other night I went out with my friend and we bought a gram of coke for about 70 US dollars. We went to this bar and after getting our drinks we quickly escaped to the bathroom and cut up a fat line each then went back to our seats feeling that we were tricking the rest of the world. The drip was nasty, as usual, this time a little more so. My teeth went pretty much completely numb and I was off. I was feeling nervous and could not concentrate on anything for long periods of time, so a time later we went for another line and then another. There were some minor visual distortions, the lights had a definite brighter glow to them and some minor color enhancement. My palms were sweating so much that I was constantly wiping them back and forth on my jeans when I was not biting my nails or smoking cigarettes one after the other. ", "I was not really very social at all and was not having much conversation with my friend at all, except when we hinted at escaping to the bathroom for another line. We would tell each other 'it's good, heh,' and all the other bullshit that I vomit out in whilst high on cocaine. I was not comfortable anywhere I was and not comfortable with myself. I felt nothing for no one or myself and all I wanted was another line when the gram was finished. The subject of getting another one was brought up at 7:0o AM in the morning. Thankfully we did not and went home.", "I think coke is a fake drug that gives me a nothingness feeling and it is also bloody expensive. Never again will I fall in to the same repeating film of coke and coke nights out on the town.", "I've always had an interest in psychoactives.   As a teenager,  while other boys were exploring sports and forging vernal heterosexual relationships,   I was reading Carlos Castaneda & Aldous Huxley!   At present,  I am 37,  and am proud to say that I have been Clean & Sober for over 6 mos. now:   I don't use anything stronger than Zoloft.   During my teens and twenties I experimented with a wide variety of narcotics and stimulants and hallucinogens,  both pharmacological and botanical,  so I have a pretty broad experiential base of using psychotropes of every stripe.  No-one knows better than I just how malleable what we call 'personality' and 'consciousness' are.   While,  philosophically,  I do not believe that one's awarenesses are purely a solipsism,  I am however,  convinced that we humans project--  in the Freudian sense--   a lot of shit of our own onto the quanta out there.   As the Gnostics urged,  'Knowing Thyself' truly is the most exigent overarching life task for each of us during this long, strange trip we call Life.", "Now.   About coke.   Or 'cola',  as we initiates used to call it.   If we called it 'cola',   we could allude to it casually and safely in telephone-and grocery store conversations with our eavesdroppers supposed to be none-the-wiser;   we could be talking about stockpiling soft drink for all they knew.   ", "I first tried coke in Las Vegas in 1993,  when I was 20 years old.   I had befriended the piano player of a MAJOR R&B diva, and, after a sellout concert at one of the Strip's big casinos, he took me backstage to party with other Vegas showbiz types.   At 20, I was already a connoisseur of the finest pot, had dabbled in 'shrooms & morning glory seeds, and had ingested capsules of amphetamine at late-night discos.  So, I was surprised to find that the two lines of coke I snorted here did absolutely nothing for me!   I remember my right leg feeling numb or something,   and my lips, too,  but that was it.", "Then, for many years, it never crossed my path.   Later,  when I was 35,   I was working as a musician & standup act in a nightclub.   My buddies,  the bartenders and waiters in the club, showed me their trick for appearing chirpy and responsive to customers all night long without flagging: 'cola'.", "Oh. My. God.  that was it!  I knew thenceforth that it was 'my' drug of choice. I began using it prior to performances.  I had read that Lenny Bruce and other comedians had sworn by coke to enhance their onstage patter. And it was true,  I discovered: on coke-- at least during the 'honeymoon phase' of my usage--  I was fast,  funny and furious.    After an initial brief spate of chills and slight sweating and 'butterflies',   I would mellow out the coke with a shot or two of Jack Daniel's or Campari.   And then,  was I in the groove!   'Riding the train'.   'Banging the gong'.   (incidentally,  did you know that 'banging a gong' is old 1930's Harlem jazzbo slang for tooting coke?  And you thought T. Rex was singing about sex or something)  ", "And,  by God,  I was funny!   My audiences,  which usually numbered between 60--100 people,  confirmed this with their riotous laughter,  giving the lie,  I realized,  to the 1960's right-wing pooh-pooh that the artistic inspirations the Beatnik imagines himself to be having on drugs are embarrassingly illusory and fatuous.   Wired on coke,  I found I could more easily stay that hair's breadth ahead of the audience's own mental processes--   essential to maintaining ascendancy in the psychic tug-of-war that is standup comedy.  ", "And coke,  as any user will tell you,   makes you speak more frankly (also essential to good comedy).   Some dam of inhibition is sundered,  and you feel just great about discussing the intimate crannies of your sexuality,  for instance,   with relative strangers.   It feels surprisingly,  refreshingly good to do so,   and your listeners are often dazzled and impressed by your candor--    that is,   unless they are tooted up, too,  and are racing ahead on their own juggernaut of conversational clouds.", "I quickly learned why coke was the preferred drug of choice during the 1970's New York,  Studio 54 years:  coke can be glamorous.   For one,  it's prep and usage can be enhanced with various aesthetic accoutrements,  such as a 24-carat-gold,  or glass,   nasal straw-let;    or mysterious little amber or cobalt glass apothecaries;  coy little neck pendant/caches,   or sexy,  lozenge-shaped,  beveled coffee-table mirrors.   I loved the ritual of it all,   which could be conducted in someone's den,   or sexily and surreptitiously in a disco bathroom.  Coke was slick,  urbane,  grown-up,  not stinky, gothic-dark and teenage-suburban,  like pot-smoking.

Have you noticed how,  in a movie,  only the salient and dramatic moments of a character's story are spliced together?   You never,  for example,  have to slog through the onscreen character's having to clip his toenails or pay bills or pop a blackhead,  or listen to long interstices of silence in the ramble of a desultory conversation.   Thus is reality for the Coked:   life is poetry: accelerated, shined,  tweaked, pruned of its prosaic,  pedestrian footage.   Every utterance you or your fellow stonees make seems to  be sharp,  dramatic,  witty,  encapsulated-- jjust like movie dialogue.   Little transitional moments disappear:   you find yourself engaged in group chatter one moment,   then looking into their bathroom mirror the next,   just like in an elegant film edit.   Above all,  there is an immanent thrill in your loins that SOMETHING exciting--  one doesn't know quite WHAT--   is going to HAPPEN.    ANY second now.   (It often never does,   but one is not swayed.)", "What I didn't know about coke at the time I began using it frequently  (up to an 8-ball a day),  is that coke usage has A VERY PREDICTABLE TRAJECTORY of effect in the habitual user,  that is consistent from user to user,   from country to country.   In other words,  scientists know what it's going to do to you if you stay with it over a certain amount of time.

But gradually,  the dopamine neurochemistry in one's brain begins to erode,   exacerbated, surely, by the accompanying lack of sleep and inconsistent nutrition of the frequent user.   The effects of coke change imperceptibly from euphoria,  mirth,  concupiscence & excitement,   to irritability,   inability to concentrate,  and then eventually...(drum roll,  please)... PARANOIA.", "NO drug can produce a paranoia quite like cocaine can.   On pot,  you wondered if your mommy & daddy might catch you toking;   on acid,   you wondered if you'd ever sleep again;  but on coke you begin to be convinced that SOMEBODY'S WATCHING YOU,  LISTENING TO YOUR EVERY WORD,   EVEN PLUGGED INTO YOUR INNER THOUGHTS AND IDEATIONS,  ALL THE TIME.    Whomever you deem to be Big Brother:   your folks,  the local police,  the Feds,  the Narcs,   the military/industrial complex,  the Mafia,   the FBI,   the CIA,  the Rand Corporation,  Madison Avenue,  Scotland Yard,  the KGB,  Interpol & Deutschebank--   surely they have tracked you down,  the deviant miscreant that you are,  using their latest supersonic,  high-tech,  laser/ultrasound,   infrared/ultraviolet espionage/surveillance devices.

At one point, I became convinced  that a bird chirping in a nearby tree,  was really a Tiki-Room-style clockwork, his chattering wooden bill programming me with encrypted commands from the military.  My pupils,  dazed and dilated from drug and insomnia,  started to produce will-o'-the-wisp lights twinkling in the dark peripheries, which I mistook for camera flashes from some unnamed, yet zealous, inimical paparazzi.

The user is now buying larger quantities of coke,  and more frequently, but finding that the resultant intolerable paranoia is tweaking his conscience to flush the remaining expensive powder down the bathroom sink, and hide all the single-eged razor blades and demi-snipped peppermint-striped Dairy queen straws.

If he is lucky--as I was-- he will have trusted people in his life who will tolerate the hallucinations and delusions and support him in kicking this pernicious, diabolical habit.   ", "When you finally DO kick coke, be prepared for a month or two of monstrous depression and anhedonia (inability to find pleasure in any life pursuit or activity), and maybe a colossal weight gain. In my case, I took up smoking like Patsy Stone on ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.  I later read that nicotine tickles the same 'pleasure centers' of the brain that coke does.", "No.  All of life's experiences are valuable learning experiences. 'non,  je ne regrette rien'", "What I had really wanted to get was ecstasy but all my friends were dry that night. and you know how it is when you get it in your head to be fucked up. you have to get something. so a friend was selling eightballs (3.5 grams of coke)and I went ahead and made the purchase. My best friend had done coke before - is still fighting the addiction - and so I knew that if I was going to do this I would at least have someone experienced around me. ", "I was so nervous before I did that first line. My stomach was all in knots. In retrospect, I did a monster line. Almost immediately my pulse sped up and I felt a little edgy. After a few minutes I calmed down and did another monster line. I began to feel almost as though I was on X, only I had much more energy and couldn't stop moving around. My friend chooses to use coke with needles, and though at first i refused to even watch him, I was so out of my head after maybe an hour that when he offered to give me a hit intravenously, I didn't have any problem with it even though I hate needles. I'm not sure where my self-defense mechanisms went, but all I cared about was how to get a better rush. I wanted to know what my friend was feeling. I was talking a mile a minute, feeling very open. In that respect it was similar to ecstasy, but without the physical sensetivity. The intravenous rush was more like smoking rock than snorting the powder. Almost immediately I felt something pushing me back, making me relax, making me feel good. I had to close my eyes. I did that twice (though I'd said only once and never again), and I hope I never do it again. I don't like the idea of having no real self control. I did so much coke that night that I physically could not stop moving around. We started using at around 11:30 PM and the next time I looked at the clock it was 4:30 in the morning. I couldn't believe that so much time had passed. ", "By 6:00 the entire eightball was gone. I don't know who had the majority of it, but my friend was coming down hard while I was still wriggling around in my underwear and a tank top (at some point during the night I had decided that the pants needed to come off).", "I left his house with a bad feeling. Using cocaine can be a social thing, but not if an addict is involved. It wasn't as though we were hanging out together and doing this. He was using and I was using and we were in our own separate worlds. I don't feel good about that. I feel drugs should be used to enhance, not to separate. ", "So from that first experience I learned that 'everything in moderation' should be applied to cocaine as well. ODing on coke, a line that I believe I was teetering on, is no fun. Coke can be fun, but not if you use it for the wrong reasons (eg: because you need more, because you're depressed, etc). Be smart, listen to your body, and be careful.", "so it all began while i was in london. i called my roommate and she told me that she owed me an apology but wouldn't tell me why. when i got home i understood. i had tried cocaine for the first time on spring break  and she bitched me out for doing it. i said i'd never snort anything. i'd done all the basics except coke, crack, and heroin. that was the only time i did it.", "fast-forward--my friend was talking about an apology because she had done it. right before i left to go to europe, we met a bunch of new guys. little did i know we would have soo much in common and they would introduce new world's to us....  my friend(let's call her beth) didn't just snort it, she shot it up or rigged it as we call it. when i got back, i also rigged cocaine for the first time. don't let anyone tell you different--that is the way to do cocaine. it is the most intense feeling one could ever have. i never got the 'wa wa's' the first 10 or 12 times i shot up.  but the first time i did, just imagine the feeling: it hits your vien, there's  about 3 seconds of waiting and then everything around starts to sound metallic. if water is running that's the most metallic sound. everything sounds like luke skywalker is right beside you twirling his lightsaver.", "Wanting to get the wa wa's made my boyfriend and i almost break up, i lied to evryone, i was broke, lying to dealers, and i lost 4 jobs while i was behaving this way.there were 5 of us at the beginning of the railroad to hell and we introduced it to about 15 other people. let me tell you what happened: one of them went to rehab and my roommate and best friend, beth had to move back home to her parents house to get away. then there's the reason i stopped rigging, my friend that almost died.

I took one look at his arms and i had to run to the bathrrom and throw-up. he had track marks all the way up his arms. i couldn't handle that. 911 had already been called but weren't there. i tried and tried to hold that knot but it kept moving and we were both frantic. i mean--i couldn't sit there and i couldn't really help him. i don't know if you can imagine but try to. my very good friend was about to die and i couldn't really do anything for him. and worst of all it could have been me. that's the day i stopped shooting up.

", "i still snort occasionally but not much. i relized how fucked up i was. i'd come home every morning after be out all night and cry to my boyfriend and tell him it was the last time. i'd stay out all night with my dealer--what must have gone on in my boyfirnd's head i don't even want to know.", "'Be careful, and use it wisely, this drug can TAKE you' ", "Sounds like an old wise man doesn't it?

During that first weekend, I snorted two grams, stayed up all night and paid the penalty with the 'crash'. I knew then, that cocaine had to be treated with respect, and that it could eventually TAKE me.", "Now, I enjoy it as a treat. One gram every couple of months.

After drinking beer out by the volcanoes, we decided to go back into town and see what else we could dig up to do.

", "I had not done cocaine in well over two years. My junior year in high school it came briefly into my life as a way to get homework done, but after losing a $100 bag of it I decided that I was ordained to quit. ", "I was drunk and stoned at the time and so had few inhibitions left to stop me from taking that first line of coke. It was like I had found a long lost friend. The euphoria hit me hard and almost instantly. I was buzzing and happy, going so strong that my fellows were tempted to punch me to get me to shut the hell up. ", "I remember I kept talking about how it had been far too long, far too long since I had brought cocaine into my life. I made arrangements to buy a 2-gram bag that evening, and after scrounging up money and dumping my bank account I had enough to go get it. ", "The first bag lasted me almost three weeks. Then I promised myself that when I ran out I would not do it anymore. But then the bag ran out and I was so sad I had to go hook up more. I finished that and swore I would quit. ", "Then the dreams started. I would have them almost every night. I was afraid to go to sleep because of them. They were always the same, hooking up with my friend and buying a large quantity of coke. The dreams ate at me until finally I gave in and bought over 6 grams of coke. ", "Once that was over I promised myself that I would quit. I did for a little while. The dreams didn't come but my mind kept demanding more coke. It would just all of a sudden decide it wanted it and would not let me do anything else till I had a bag in my hands and a line up my nose. ", "Every major and minor event in my life became another excuse to buy cocaine and do it in a binge of one night or sometimes I would make it out of the binge with a gram or two and it would last me several days to a week. ", "I would stay up all night snorting line after line. Then run out sometime in the afternoon of the next day and need more to appease the pain I was feeling for lack of sleep and way too much cocaine.", "I started taking a special type of cocaine cut with a small quantity of methamphetamine, which made the euphoria last longer and reach greater heights. ", "Soon the paranoia, depression and hallucinations would start in on me during a binge. But I continue doing it to this day. Now, almost a year after I swore I would quit, I still find money for a couple bags every other week or every other day at times. ", "The mindset you get into in a binge is amazing. I remember sitting down and cussing my nostrils because one was so blocked up no coke could go up so I had to use the one that was bleeding. Instead of stopping the coke for a while to heal, I pushed it up the wounded nostril and ignored the intense sting it caused. ", "I still wake up in the mornings and swear off the 'demon powder' when my nostrils are burning so much that I can hardly stand it and have to pour water down my nose to cool it off, which of course does nothing. ", "Coke can be a great drug. It is a lot of fun and the quality of the high, while short, is so intense and pure that it drives you for more. I never have physical withdrawal symptoms, only intense mental drives that willpower can hardly fight, and often can not fight at all. ", "If it was unavailable or I had no more sources of money, quitting cocaine would be a relatively simple and fairly painless exercise. But one thing I can say for sure about the thralls of a binge, is that as long as you can get it, you will. Even if it leaves you broke and homeless. ", "In conclusion, I would not recommend cocaine to people with obsessive or addictive personalities. And those that do decide to try the drug, be careful you do not allow your mind to convince you of the safety of the drug, and that 'one more bag can not hurt.'", "I tried coke for the first time about mid 1999. There was a group of us going clubbing and someone got some, knowing it was coming had given some of us non users(at the time!) a buzz just from anticipation. We had been smoking grass on and off for years, but this was something different, something just that little bit naughty. Anyway we tried it, got this amazing feeling, like really being alive, every one of my senses felt like I was using them for the first time. Totally amazing. Didn't do any for a while and then it gradually became more regular. Now although we all say we are giving it(again!!) We say we will only have it for special occasions, but soon anything gets called an occasion.

You know how you are going to feel when you are on it (amazing) and you you how you will feel as you come off it (wishing you hadn't had it), but that doesn't really matter because you tell yourself its the last time, next time you will say no! ", "But next time you tell yourself the same thing. Its not that its bad, well we can all think of worse things than a line of coke (if we put our minds to it!), its that you know you will never really kick it completely, that voice will always be there, when you least expect it, it will say to you ' get a line of coke down you and you know your confidence is going to be 200% and you can do anything!'

Somedays my nose hurts so bad I can't snort coke, so I'll buy some crack. I do about 4 lines before school, and more lines whenever I can sneak them in. I carry my coke with me everywhere. Everytime I do a line it makes me want to cry because I know that I'm hurting the person that I care most about. But I cant stop.

They say there she is, shes the coke head. They walk by me and snort. You know its bad when the people that you sometimes snort it with tell you that you might want to slow down. I ran out of money a long time ago. Now I sell whatever I can. I had a job but I got fired, and now I dont have the energy to look for a new job. Nothing gets me going anymore. The other day I looked in the mirror and the reflection staring back at me didnt even look familar. One day before school I did a little too much.

I had some extra cash, so I decided to get $20 worth (which to anybody familiar with cocaine, is about .3g, at least where I'm from).

Before shunning cocaine, I decided I didn't have enough to really make me feel it the way I should (I know this is incorrect but the second reason should rectify this), and my setting was pretty boring.

As I was coming down, it was time to dip into the coke.  We took turns doing lines all night, about every 30 minutes, and oh my God, it was amazing.  My mushrooms were pretty much all gone, I knew that before I started snorting.  I had about an hour left before I was totally back to normal and feeling blah-ish like I usually do after mushrooms.  After I did the coke, I sat down and a couple friends of mine were having a small argument.  I looked at them and all I could think about was 'I know they're arguing and that's negative but holy shit I'm having such a great time just sitting here doing absolutely nothing.'  I even said aloud, that I was having a great time.  I felt VERY euphoric (more than a typical euphoric coke feeling, obviously because of the mushrooms).  What I was feeling was completely textbook material.  It just blew me away how great everything was and seemed.  I was rushing quite a bit, throughout my entire body.  Simply amazing.  A bit later my friend and I rolled up a joint with some coke in it and passed it around with a few other people.  I was pretty wrecked after that.  I was quite pleased with my mental state on cocaine.  So clear and fresh, so much self-esteem.  The night seemed to unfold with joy and excitement, everything I did and everything people said was completely interesting and caught my undivided attention.", "The last time I did coke I snorted an entire gram to myself from about 12pm-12pm the next day.  I smoked a coke-laced joint with my roommate.  I was just coming off of E when I started the coke.  I had a blast.  And throughout all this time I've never though 'I want more I want more' or had any cravings for coke at all.  in fact I couldn't finish the last 4 or so lines of my original 1.5g, my sinuses were completely raw (I had a pretty tough cold at the time, so I don't really question the purity much).  The back of my throat stung like MAD.  Basically I got to the point where it hurt more to snort the coke than to get the high.  Besides by that time it wasn't that great anymore.  I wasn't increasing my dosage so basically my tolerance was taking over each time I did it.", "I'm very happy that I have found out just what coke is and how it *actually* affects me.  Coke is definitely a mixing drug (of course not EVERY drug :)  watch out people, read up before you mix).   I think I'd rather START doing coke while I'm high on mush, pot, or a little drunk or at least coming off of any one of them, and just continue with coke.  I guess I just feel it wayyyy better than I would otherwise.  I'm also quite pleased with the fact that I seem to have no addiction what-so-ever to it, having done it quite a few times in the time span since I've started.

I started to get the usual nose twitches.  Then my sinuses released and I wiped my nose.  I expected for it to be clear like all the other times, but it wasn't.  I had a handful of blood.

My hair was dirty, oily, because I'd neglected showering to get high, to stay high.  My teeth were yellow and covered with nicotine stains and plaque.  I had gone from a healthy 105 pounds to around 85, and I almost looked like a cancer patient.  Now I had blood running out of my nose into my mouth.  18 years old.  The prime time of life.  I don't know why I woke up then, why it had to take something so horrifying for me to realize that I was killing myself.  I called my mom and asked her if I could come home.

I was upset with him for no apparent reason, I wanted to be left alone. It felt good to lie down in my bed and just enjoy the numb, yet alert feeling I was experiencing. I laid there for a while. I then realized there were at least 30 people in my apartment at 2 in the am. I got up and everything was cool until I went to bed. I think I just needed time to myself with the drug.  The only thing I did not want to do that night was smoke marijuana. I enjoyed the feeling of being alert and having energy on coke.", "I did it straight everyday for two weeks.

The cocaine makes them paranoid, restless, and it is hell on your blinds and carpet. I will not lie, I have felt paranoid at times but I understand why and I just let the feeling go. When the feeling starts to wear off, the best thing, I have found, is to try and sleep. It is difficult at first but like everything else its mind over matter. Or the more traditional remedy, of course, Marijuana.", "My first time using cocaine was an earth-shattering experiance. I bought 5 grams from my friendly dealer(For some reason i knew i was gonna like it, so i bought a good amount.) I decided to try it by myself the first time. As i snorted the first line i realized that this was the drug that i have been searching for. After about 6 lines i was fucked. No one could touch me and i loved the everything about the drug. After the drips ended, i touted 6 more lines and I was 'driving that train.' The continued the cycle of snorting and stayed fucked up all night. The next morning all i could think about was snorting more. It made me realize that if not handled with care then coke addiction can get out of hand. In all my other drug experiences, nothing could compare to the feeling of euphoria on coke. I believe that every person has a special drug that they call their favorite. Mine would have to be cocaine! Cocaine can suck you in to a frenzy, but if kept under control it is a very rewarding experience.", "It all started at the age of 15. Some friends of mine were looking for a new kind of high besides weed so we all decided to try some 'girl'. At first, we just bought a quarter $25 worth. My boyfriend laid out the lines and told us how to hold the straw so that we could sniff. ", "When my turn came I inhaled deeply and the coke shot straight to my brain. What a Feeling! The only bad thing was the thick drip that drizzled down my throat. After only a few moments I felt stronger than I ever had. I was so full of energy and life. I wanted more. My boyfriend bought $75 dollars worth and we all started to sniff some more. I never went to sleep and at that time I felt so alert and hyper. As the years went on my habit got up to $200 a day!", "As good as this all sounds the effects after I came down were terrible. I was groggy and irritated. My stomach was so upset that I could barely hold anything down. Even worse when the habit becomes to much, I would start to steal. I would do anything to get my high. 6 years later and after 1 year of sobriety I still can smell the coke that once filled my body. I have stomach problems to this day and I still have the urge. So, think twice before you have to get higher!", "I write this as a wake-up call to anyone who has or has had trouble with moderation, and to be as informative as possible on a topic with an impossible stigma-- IV drug use.", "I began experimenting with drugs when I was 12...pot, pharmaceuticals, LSD, mushrooms, MDMA, DXM, heroin, and ketamine...but nothing has compared with my love affair with cocaine.  ", "Two years ago, I began snorting coke with my friends on a semi-regular basis.  It was a social interaction, and to tell you the truth, I wasn't all that impressed with it.  Back then, I was a diehard fan of 'downers'...mostly heroin and morphine, so feeling like my eyes were bugging out of my head and my brain was going to explode was not my idea of fun. ", "Eventually, I met a special friend.  Soon after we encountered each other, we found that we both shared a comparable love for injectable drugs, for some reason.  After conspiring together for paraphenalia and goods (you can't buy needles from drug stores where I live without a perscription), we sat down one night to shoot cocaine for the first time. ", "At first, we didn't do quite enough.  The effect was a slightly metallic taste in the mouth, shivers, and a strong euphoric feeling.  Ten minutes later we each did more...the amount of which I'm not sure, because it's difficult to measure in a spoon.  Anyway, this second injection gave me the most beautiful feeling I have ever experienced in my life.  The world started to sparkle, there was an intense, high-pitched ringing in my ears, my cheeks were hot, but my eyes were opened.  It was amazing.  We only had a gram between the two of us that night, so that was enough for about four or five injections each.", "This became a trend with us.  Then it became quite a habit.  Every weekend, we would get together with two 8-balls (7 grams) of coke and shoot it till it ran out. We would begin at 9:00pm...wait 30 minutes, shoot again, wait 15, shoot again, wait 15, shoot again, etc. etc., until I would look at the clock and it would say 5:30am.  I was not careful with my habit, and let it destroy me.  Soon, I grew dehydrated and weak, couldn't eat, absolutely could not sleep, my eyes turned dull and I grew irritable and grey.  The track marks on my arms, hands, and legs were large red and navy blue bubbles whose bruises turned yellow and translucent.  I began not to care how people saw me...my friends would call concerned, and I'd tell them to stop caring about me.  I wanted to die, and soon...oh, but that would mean I couldn't shoot any more coke, so nevermind. ", "This escapade went on for four months, which may not seem like such a long time to you.  Trust me, it was a lifetime.  Eventually, my best friend forced me to go into rehab, which changed my life forever.  I didn't want to go, but I was sick.  I was weak and hungry for anything that was white and powdery and pure. It was not easy to give up, and it took me a long time to decide that's what I really wanted to do. Many people will say that cocaine is not physically addictive, but it was for me.  It took three weeks of IV's to feed me, of not walking, of not sleeping more than a couple hours a day...it was hell.  Now when I think about shooting coke, I still experience that feeling of intense desire and hunger that only an ex-druggie can truly know.", "I do not write this to tell anyone what to do, or even to dissuade you from experimenting with intravenous cocaine use. If you are responsible, they produce fun and spiritually exhilirating experiences.  For me, the problem was with moderation and self-care, with losing myself and my spirit to a drug, which is not supposed to happen. Drugs, I believe, are here to enhance the mind and spirit, to turn you inside out and let you experience yourself in a different way.  ", "So I leave you with a part of my life...perhaps it is here to save yours.", "The first time I ever tried coke was at at a party at my house. My roomate was really getting into it and I had never thought about trying it. One night a friend of my boyrfirends came over and got a gram for about 100 bucks or so. My boyfriend told me to try a numie on my gums. I was really nervous about it but when i did do it it was the coolest thing in the whole world. My gums felt like I had sucked on an ice cube for hours, when all it took was a little coke. By that time I was really considering trying it. So I told the guy if maybe we could go in the other room and do it with out all those people watching, (you have to understand, I was very nervous at the time) so we went upstairs to the kitchen and he cut up some lines for himself and I. When it was time to do it, I almost chickened out. My boyfriend, who did coke a while back told me to try just one line to see if I liked it, if not then no pressure to do it again. So I did. I had never felt anything like that before in my life. ", "My senses were lit up like candles. The effects from the three beers I had drunk were gone completely. I felt like cleaning the house from top to bottom. I mean, that was something I had never felt in my life. I could compare it to caffeine but it's way better then that. I then decieded to try one in the other nose and that was even better. It picked up where the other line left off. It was incredible. My boyfriend just kept looking at me with a smile on his face. I LOVED IT!! It made me feel like a very outgoing person. I mean I was talking to everybody, I'm usually very shy around people but this stuff made me what you call the belle of the ball. So the next night they all came over again and I was so ready to do it. I mean the energy from it is wild. ", "Over the course of a year I still do cocaine from time to time when I have a surplus of cash. I mean I don't think I could ever refuse it if it was right out in front of me. When I bought the last bag I told myself to save some, but when in truth, you can't. You never will. It is gone. Just like that Clapton song. It's the truth. You can never get it back. But I love it just the same. I was up till five in the morning when I did the most I ever really kept track of, a half gram, I really have to say this and if this is the only advice I ever give it is this: Anyone who tries coke 9 out of 10 like it and would do it again. That is a personal fact. And if you do coke you will be broke, or feel like a fool for wasting your money on it when you could have spent it on something else. I'm not sorry I ever tried it like most are, I'm glad I had the experience so if anyone asks me I'll be able to tell them straight up what it's all about.", "I tried cocaine at a party about 3 weeks ago. I was looking for 'X' (MDMA) but none was available so a friend offered to bump me up. I took two hits and nothing happened. I had the nasty drip, but all it did was irritate and speed me up. At least when I snorted 'X' I had more fun. So after I smoked a bit of the joint that was laced with it my friend offered to bump me up again. All it made want to do was go dance but in a bad way. With ecstasy I want to dance because it enhances the cool feelings that I am already having about the music and my surroundings, coke just was making me extremely annoyed. All in all, when I got home I just wanted to go to sleep, so I took care of that. I wouldn't ever try it again, and I don't see how anyone could spend their money on such a worthless drug. I'd rather have 'X' and weed at responsible intervals than deal with something that is that hit and miss. My friend had not tried it, but, she smoked off that joint and she was certainly enjoying herself, meanwhile I just wanted to leave. She also didn't wake up till 6pm the next afternoon. Odd.", "Cocaine is the devil..of this I am convinced. This powdered devil causes normally kind and loving people to hurt those they love,become impossible and downright ugly..all fiendish things indeed. I use coke alone, although it had at one time been a social and 'fun' drug for me. I spend hours snorting and stalking around my house..looking for people out to get me. I promised those who love me that I am done with it..but still I return to the devil and my self imposed hell. ", "They call on the phone, these loved ones, and I dodge their calls, for I am too paranoid and fucked up to speak to them. I hide and scream that I am a piece of shit and hide from them. I forget to feed my dogs, forget to wash , forget to brush my teeth, forget to do anything..except MORE coke. I do come down, and the 'I'm sorries' begin. I promise I am done with it..and at that time I truly am..until the next time...", "A few years back I went on a trip down south through Mexico, Central America, and then to Colombia and Ecuador. It was great fun, and a very rewarding experience.", "In Guatamala I met an English guy named Nigel that had been in Colombia. He said that he had traveled from England, going to Brazil, then through various countries, and ending up in Colombia. Nigel told me that along the route he met locals that became his friends, and often they used Cocaine. Nigel said he had been afraid of Cocaine, having been brought up in the typical 'drugs are bad' environment. He was afraid that if he tried it he'd become addicted. Eventually he saw that although his friends used it, they were not addicted. He tried it, and he liked it. He told me that he used it daily for a couple of months. I asked him if it was hard to stop. He said it wasn't.", "Now I left him and I kept heading south. He told me of a place called the Hotel Miramar in Santa Marta, Colombia. It's east from Cartegena. He said it's a place where gringos can go and use cocaine, and not really be hassled. Somewhere along my trip I decided I wanted to try cocaine if I had the opportunity.", "I made it to Colombia and ended up in Santa Marta. The Hotel Miramar was a fantastic place because it's a gringo hangout. My spanish was decent but I could never get close to the natives because it was too cumbersome talking in their language, and very few Latins speak English. Colombia has a reputation of being unsafe so not many tourists go there, so if you're travelling around the country you feel like you're the only gringo.", "So it was nice to meet up with other travellers in the Hotel Miramer. There were people that stayed there for months or years, and then the others that would come for just a day or two. I ended up staying there for a month. I was waiting for mail from home, and also I was enjoying the company of other travellers.", "During this time I tried cocaine, and decided I liked it. I would snort the cocaine only. I'd typically use it with other travellers, then a bunch of people would get together and just talk or hang out. I'd usually start using it in the early evening, continue over about a 6 hour period, then I'd stop and go to sleep. I never used it as a pick-me-up in the morning. I got in the habit of only using it when I already felt pretty good.", "There were other people that used it a lot more--they would keep going for more than a day or two. I thought this was silly because even though you don't feel sleepy, you know your body wants to sleep, and I didn't want to push it. Also there's not much point in using it for longer periods, as the effect seems to diminish. I would build up a tolerance so that as the time wore on I'd have to take it more and more frequently (over the 4 or 6 hour period in the evening). As I say, I'd usually be with other people when using it and we'd sometimes go out in the night for walks. While in the Hotel you feel perfectly safe using it, it's not a good idea to carry it around town with you--you never know.", "I figure that over the month I used the cocaine maybe 15 or 20 times. I liked the feeling it gave me. It completely eliminates any feelings of inhibition, so you feel comfortable talking about anything. You also feel fascinated by what other people are saying, although I would prefer to talk. You feel really good, like the cocaine is tickling your pleasure center. You feel energetic. You wouldn't get hungry.", "After a month I decided that the surroundings were getting stale, so I left to go to a neighboring beach called Park Tayrona. It's a really beautiful place and a lot of gringos hang out there as well. I didn't do any cocaine while here but I didn't miss it either. There was no feeling of dependency. Cocaine was more of something I did when it seemed like a good idea--not because I felt I needed it. It was something that you'd use when you're already having a good time--it would kick you up into the next level of enjoyment.", "There was immeasurable pot available also in Colombia. I used to smoke a little but didn't really smoke enough to get over the munchy/can't concentrate stage. Other people constantly smoked the stuff. I never really understood the allure. I figured that the best time to use it was when you were hungry and wanted the local food to taste like a king's banquet :^).", "The only problems I had with the cocaine was frequent pain in my nose. I was told this was because it wasn't pure, or that it was amphetamine and not cocaine. Over my trip I tried cocaine many more times and it seemed always a variable experience, depending on where I got it. Also my opinion of what 'good' cocaine was never matched anyone else's. One guy gave me some of what he said was the best he had ever used in his life, and it had no effect at all on me. I later decided that what I had called cocaine before was some kind of amphetamine, and what this guy called cocaine was really cocaine (pure), and that for some reason it didn't work on me. This guy used to smoke it also (freebasing) and I tried that several times but never once had any significant effect, although he was flying. After several times when someone would tell me 'try this, this is the best' and it did nothing for me, I decided that the substance I had liked before was no longer available and I stopped testing.", "At no time did I ever feel any withdrawal symptoms. Also I never used it every single day--I would stop for a day or two after each day or two of use. And I never used it for a period longer than 6 hours.", "I feel my experience with the drug hasn't been harmful at all. Instead it destroyed a lot of myths I had absorbed in the United States culture. I learned that the substance had absolutely no addictive qualities at all. Then I decided that the biggest problem was since it was illegal down there as well (at least if you got caught you'd have to pay a bribe to make the cop go away) you never knew 'exactly' what you were getting. The danger of the drug was never the pure part but what you ended up getting that was called 'cocaine'. I believe my experience with the cocaine has improved me, and I believe everyone (provided they're adults) should have the same option to experiment. The only improvement I could suggest would be fixing the situation so you know what you're getting every time, instead of it being a crap shoot.", "Since Colombia is the source of this stuff, it's certainly going to be cheaper. I never paid more than $4 or $5 a gram, and typically paid $3. Of course I believe it wasn't quite as pure because I'd use a gram over an evening, and from what I've heard about stuff in US that's A LOT. Since Colombia I've never used any of the stuff. My thinking is I've heard prices in the US are $100 per gram. At the time I was taking it I felt that it was barely worth the $4 a gram. There's no way I'll pay 25 or 33 times what I could get it for down there.", "Pot was also much cheaper. I saw a guy buy perhaps a half pound for something like $7.00. It's truly a weed, and isn't really illegal. Pot is so cheap you never have to buy it--it just gets passed around by people that keep their own supply.", "Wages in Colombia are so low compared to wages here, the locals have to pay almost the same proportion of their income to buy cocaine as Americans would have to in the US. I never really saw any evidence of massive drug addiction in Colombia. Almost 100% of the drug use seemed to be by the gringos that were visiting.", "I've decided that I believe drugs should be legalized. I believe that we've all been victims of a horrible propaganda campaign. I believe it would be much better if drugs were legalized, regulated (for purity), and also perhaps taxed a little to cover costs of chronic abusers. I believe it is a good idea to travel, because you find out interesting things, like perhaps the USA isn't really as free as you might have thought. In Colombia the police don't really care if you use illegal substances--they just use it as an excuse to sweat a bribe out of you. They're not interested in throwing you in jail, they just want some of your yanqui $$$. Yes, the system is very, very corrupt.", "Colombians were probably my favorite people. The country is beautiful and the people are very friendly. Although Colombia has gotten a bad rap in the news, this is unjust. While a few drug kingpins control a lot of the politics in the country and are ruthless murderers, the Colombian people are almost entirely very warm, intelligent, friendly people. It is truly a great country.", "When I came back up through Mexico and went through the border crossing at Tijuana, I told the officer that I had just flown up from Cartegena, Colombia. He then checked me out a little more thoroughly than he would have if I'd only been in Mexico--he checked my drivers licence and then looked at my backpack in the xray machine. I don't think he had me unpack it. But the guy said that Colombia wasn't a good place, and the people were screwing us over. His statement simply is not at all true.", "One other interesting point: As I understand it if I'm outside the US I am no longer bound by US laws, but must obey the laws of the country I'm in--but that country enforces them and the US doesn't care anymore. I was told by Germans that their laws are binding on them no matter where they are. For example if they get caught in Colombia using drugs and are punished there, the Colombian government will inform the German government, and send them home, and when they get to Germany the German government will then pushish them again. I thought this was rediculous.", "I was 17 years old when i firsly entered the imaginary world of chemicals. I started with ecxtasy pills, continued with lsd, tried crack, snifed heroin and finally i tried 'the magic dust' as my clubbing friends used to call it...Cocaine.", "I remember it was christmas eve 1995. I had taken 2 ecxtasy pills but i still wanted sth more. So my friend elisa's. Had the idea of us trying something different..Cocaine.That was it!! I had just commited the 'biggest crime' of my life.From that moment and on my life had become a battle for finding the coke. I spend any dime i ever got, from my work or parents in purchasing coke. I felt sick 24hrs/day using or not cocaine...My life was a living hell. ", "My friends tried to tell me to slow down but i thought i could control it. My dosage went from 4 lines to 2gr and i lost 20pounds in one month...My hair started to lose its shine, my nails broke easier, my face was like a 30 years old lady. It was terrible until one day i saw one of my best friends die from a stroke provoked my cocaine overdose. That was the beginning of my struggle of rehab. I have been clear for a year now and my life has got a meaning again...", "It was a snowy saturday night, my friend was visiting me.  When she called she said she had brought a surprise...she called it candy.  when i picked her up at the train station she told it it was cocaine.  i got a nervous feeling in my stomach.  media and school drug classes bashes cocaine and tells you its sucha horrible addictive drug.  this all made me nervous.  i had never done any hard core drugs only smoked weed.  ", "so the two of us, 15 years old, decided to go to a party.  we go and everyone was consuming alcohol.  she asked me if i wanted to go to the bathroom and we brought our bag with us.  we crushed the coke on the toilet seat with a credit card.  we had about 100 dollars worth and it looked like nothing.  i took a 20$ bill and rolled it up while she seperated lines with a razor.  she took three lines, then i did.  then another 3.  before we left the bathroom we checked eachothers noses.  ", "we got back out the party and after a few minutes become uninhibited, we could talk to anyone we felt like it.  after awhile my front teeth become numb and this created a weird expierence.  i had a ciggarrette which seemed to make me feel it more.  our eyes were not bloodshot and no one knew we were on anything.  time flew while we were on it but after an hour or so we came down.  i wanted more but i knew it was not mine and i felt guilty about using it.  well it was pretty good, a little more interesting then the usual weed high or drunkness. i hope its not a regular thing", "I guess I'm writing this to get a lot of it of my chest. I don't really expect any of you to read this and be scared shitless to come close to this wonderfully overpowering drug. Because I know I must have read a thousand drama stories like this one and I never stopped. But I at least hope that you get through this letter. For what reason I don't know.", "I think my first drug was probably weed. That was when I was about 15-16 years old. My boyfriend smoked, so I did. I was always this little goodie, goodie. Never smoked, did drugs, teachers pet. Then I broke loose from the secured world and I guess I headed for the real world. I did pot mushrooms, tried speed once. No big deal. I moved out on my own, A little town in Idaho. I worked at a ski resort and stayed in dorms. Dating guys upon guys, I found one who liked late nights and no boundaries. Chris was a nice guy with one fault, he loved cocaine. I then never tried it. We went to a party and nicely enough there was the talk about this drug I knew nothing about. Chris set up a buy and it was delivered. He got a gram and called my into the bathroom after him. I followed, I must admit I was exited to try it. He lined up a line for him. Then gave my mine. I snorted it and felt that horrible burn in my nostril. I hate it, but the effects were very rewarding. I wanted more and more and more. The night finally ended and we somehow fell asleep. It took forever but I was ready. ", "The next week, Me and Chris got more but this time I threw in 25$ for my quarter. We met in his dorm along with another one of him friends. I started to crack out my lines when Chris crackes out a syringe. If that didn't scare my, I don't know what would. He asked me if I had ever slammed coke and I said no. He told my to get the spoon out of the little box under the bed. I did. He grabbed my quarter and dumped some on the spoon, mixed with a little bit of water, and dropped a peace of cotton in the mixture. Placing the needle tip on the cotton, he drew the thick mixture and told me to tie my arm of. I was scared to death, but if I could get the feeling I did last time, I was willing. I tied my arm of while Chris looked for a nice vein, found one and stuck the needle in, registered and slowly pumped it into my blood stream. I felt so hot, so sick, like I was gonna puke. My heart was beating so fast, I thought I was gonna pass out. I laid down on the bed as this awesome, so intense feeling came over my. I loved it! I had to have more. Coke never lasted that long to me, Thats why I did It all the time. After that I was on my own. I could never hit myself so I always had my friends. I would get payed 300 or more dollars a week and spent every penny I had on coke. I would be gone i'm a night. I never shared, only to get someone to hit me. I lost my job because a customer saw the bruised and scars on my arms and neck and told my boss that didn't believe they were insect bites. So with that I lost my job and dorm room, I was homeless. ", "I had a friend whom lived in a condo with 5 other people. They let me move in. This was THE crack house! Everyone was hi or spracked out of there mind. So I fit in great. A lot of the drug dealers would come over to do there drugs and give out freebies. That when I started doing foily's and smoked out of glass. That was good but not as good as slamming. I went on major binges. My longest one was 3 weeks. No sleep, no food, only alcohol to drink. I developed a infection in my throat from smoking the coke and was rushed to the hospital because It was swelled to were I couldn't breath. As soon as they took my arm to take my blood pressure she saw my arm and needless to say, I didn't get much help. They gave my pills and sent me home. That didn't stop my from smoken, snorten or shooten the coke. I slept with anyone who had it. Even went as far as sleeping with a couple women for a line. I developed cotton fever. If any one does not know what that is, It is when a peace of the cotton gets inside the needle and you end up sending it into your vein. It causes a bacterial infection in your blood stream that can kill you. I recovered in the hospital tripping so bad, I though the nurses were there to kill me and I kept seeing things before my eyes. Like people walking on the ceiling and stuff so horrid, a nightmare was not compared to. ", "It took days until all the coke was out of my body and I started feeling normal again. Whatever that was. I got out and sobered up. I haven't touched coke since. I haunts me like demons. I cry at night thinking of all the people I slept with and how I almost killed myself. I crave coke not the way a normal addict would, but I crave it as a way to loose myself for good. I know deep down, that if I ever did do even a line, I probably wouldn't be able to stop this time and make it out alive.", "I am an avid user of coke, but am not addicted, I know this because I have gone for long periods without using it and don't worry when I don't have and honestly don't think about it that much. I was just browsing through the cocaine experience reports and noticed that in almost all of the reports everyone felt that they became addicted after just one session. After me and my friends did for the first time all that most of them would think about for weeks after was how they could get some more. I am now an experienced coke user and have to this day never thought about where my next line was coming from or how I was going to get it. You just have to realize that it's just a drug, you do it, you get high and then it wares off, and thats it. If you don't think you can handle something like this then you souldn't start. Don't get me wrong, coke is a good drug and makes me feel wicked, but know what you're getting into before you do it. The same goes with any drug.", "P.S. Don't ruin it for all the responsible drug users out there.", "I have done a lot of drugs. But, coke is the only one that would make me lie and cheat the people I care about. Back in December, coke started flying around my neighborhood. My best friend and I would round up $50 bucks a day, to go and get a half gram. We didn't have jobs or anything, we would steal from our parents and do basically anything to get it. Over the next weeks while I was using heavilly, I lost weight, my skin was dead white and my eyes were always bloodshot; I looked and felt so sick. I stopped using it, because it is not worth it. Sure, it makes you feel great after a line, but 20 minutes later if you don't have another line, your screwed. Don't do Coke, its not worth it, unless your a millionaire. Ive seen people spend lots of money and throw away their lives for it. Its just not worth it.", "The first time I tried coke was two and 1/2 months ago. I meet a boy who I thought could love me; instead we made addiction our love and fed off of each other's destruction. Now, I might be pregnant, I have lost many close friends, and bite my fingernails until they bleed. Although I am seeing a psychologist, and sub.abuse specialist, I still do coke almost everyday (On the days I don't do coke, I am either taking E or snorting ice). I have become numb to everything, everyone. THis drug IS A DEMON. It tests one's strength and divides the weak from the strong. I am weak. No one can save me but myself, but I don't want to be saved. I want to stay high, confident, motionless forever.

I want to be able to cry and accept all the wrong I have done, but it is like I am spellbound by this magical potion that won't let me go. Tomarrow is another day, and I have the choice to change my life, but I know I won't. I am not sure what will make me stop, hopefully it won't be the lack of my heart beating.", "Im not the pro-activist kind. Actually, for me to write this is kind of bizarre but I guess its just one way of letting it go and possibly getting some relief from my white 'friend'.", "I can't consider myself a Junkie because I lead a normal life, I go to college, have a band, girlfriend, and all those funny little things that people fill their life with in order to be called normal. I have been a pothead since i was 13 and of course, this has never caused me any problems. Kind of premature, today I'm 20 and the only thing I haven't tried is heroin.

I think I have repeated more than 25 times that I will never do it again, and here I am, without knowing if I'll find myself with my pupils the size of black holes whenever the next opportunity comes. In this long process of quitting I've had people snort in front of me more than 5 times and I've had the balls to say 'NO'. This has made me feel great as soon as I get home, with a happy face and with the possibility to sleep, but it also gives me a credit of 'I can control it!' that is as false as hell.

If you wanna know and confront all the demons you have inside, try cocaine, but be prepared to face a real mental showdown. It will bring nothing positive out of you, and no experience will ever be like the first one. Have you ever found yourself in front of a mirror with your hands trembling to the point that you cant even get the key (or whatever) up your nose without dropping the stuff? Have you seen how fucking pathetic and sad you look? That is death in your eyes, of course, with a bloody disguise that gets by anybody on accounts of what we call 'A great feeling of euphoria and control!' Fuck you, cocaine is in total and slaving control, not you. Don't let this get to be a problem for you, cause you never know what card you are gonna get in this game. Remember, she always has the last word and the last laugh. Remember this the next time you are cursing yourself for not being able to sleep and for feeling like the lowest of the low. Free your mind and spirit, don't touch anything that will perturb your peace. If you are an addict, or you just like it, next time you have a chance to do it, wait a five minutes, think about it...think about what will come when you eventually go home, and if after that, you still wanna do it, go ahead, but take the fucking five minutes. You might thank me, and most important, thank yourself for not letting that shit decide for you.", "First time I took it I liked it, but it wasn't too intense. The more I used, the more enjoyable it became. I could talk and talk and talk... And, God, play yahtzee and rummy til the wee hours. Crosswords became particularly addicitve.

I became a more regular user, and then I would start to get shaky and really wired. I would start thinking that my mom was going to come over unexpectedly to say hi and catch me doing it. I would start looking out the peephole and listening for strange noises. I would see things, like when you were a kid and were convinced that strange, distorted shadows were monsters, only I thought it was someone just dropping by. Then I started worrying about people breaking in, especially if I had watched the evening news and heard horrible crime stories. At one point I sat on the floor and turned off all the lights. It was really sick. But I still found the courage to turn on the lights and quickly cut up another line. I bought freaking pepper spray and kept in nearby. It was NOT fun anymore. But I am still using. My boyfriend tells me to chill out while he sits there and plays on the computer. The only way I ever do it anymore is if I drink or take valium while I do it.

In 1995 became pregnant and had a daughter by him. He was distant during the pregnancy but I won't say it was drug related. (I don't know) In 1996 I started noticing the serious changes in his behavior. He started staying out every night extremely late. Then when he came home he wanted to talk and talk and talk. About everything under the sun.  It would be 4:00 in the morning or later.  He would stay up for hours telling me how much he loved and appreciated me.

I would find pieces of paper in his car broke off at the ends. I guess to scoop it. I am not sure, being that I know nothing about the drug or how you use it.  I would find baggies twisted and twisted until broke off at the corners. Recently I started finding little tiny plastic seal bags that he denied belong to him.  Come on, I would think, how stupid did he think I was. Nobody else in the house had access to that kind of stuff. He kept telephone numbers of known dealers in his wallet or in his car at all times.  His attitude about everything changed. He became non-caring about any and everything one day, to very concerned and do-no-wrong other days.

His longest binge has been up to three days.  He comes home very sleepy and numb-looking in the face. Almost like his face is numb from the nose down. He doesn't think I notice it but I do.  He is very sweet when he comes home after being gone for long hours with no contact at all. Even though he is sleepy he will help clean the house or offer to do things he would normally not ask to do. My guess is either because the drugs have him up and he can't sleep, or because he feels guilty.  Some nights he is so wired until he comes to bed but can't sleep so he is out on the chair just watching TV for hours. He says it is because he is horny and I won't give in but I doubt it. Either way it annoys me because I know the deal. ", "I make excuses for him to people when they notice him acting strange. And it is destroying me. Now after 8 years of knowing him and almost 2 years of being married to him I am living out my worst fears.  The fear of him never breaking free from this horrible demon called cocaine. My guess is that he is snorting it but I can't say for sure.  Now we have 2 kids together. The youngest is 5 months old.  We just recently moved to a new area and I thought things would be different, but stupid me. Boy was I ever wrong.  Now after years of lying to me and me lying to myself not wanting to see the obvious, my suspicions were confirmed about a week ago. He broke down and told me that he has a problem. I am so angry because he is sooo smart and he wants so much in life but this demon is taking him down fast. Well there is a lot more to this story but my time and space are limited. So let me end by saying I do love him that is why I am still here now. The times are more good than bad. I guess that why it seems bearable at times. ", "But it is getting worse and worse.

And no matter what I have to do to make this possible I will do, including leaving him to fight this devil alone.  I and my kids do come first. So my prayer is that everything gets straight. He comes across that his desire is to get clean but I am doubtful he is sincere. I hope I am wrong.", "Of course, of course it all started with smoking pot. I loved the feeling of being in a different world which didn't so much closely resemble the day to day society we live in. Anyway, that was like four years ago and since then I've done many other drugs (LSD, opium, mushrooms, ALOT of pills and other things I can't remember). Throughout these years pot has always been my drug of choice. Cocaine was always something I never really thought about....my fiends had did it, but i never seemed too interested, mainly because it's so expensive.", "The first time I did it (1-2 years ago)I bought a 1/4 gram for the hell of it(there was no pot availible), went home and ended up snorting all of it with little effect except two things. I felt wired for about 5 minutes, and for about an hour I would have killed someone for more of the strange white powder. The next time I did it I wasn't expecting it at all. I stopped at my friends apartment and he was in his car ready to take off. He said he had just bought a 1/2 gram and snorted two lines..it was his first time. He was in a hurry to go to someone's house and burn a joint. I was with two other friends and they wanted to pitch in to buy a 1/2 gram (50$). I gave 'em 10 bucks and when I got back from burning one, there was the sacred white powder..ready for me to snort. I was very excited actually...the word was it was very good coke. So I snorted a line and sat back and relaxed. I noticed my heart was racing and I was alert, but that was it. All I could really focus on was I WANT MORE COCAINE! I have never had the 'pleasure' of feeling like God after ripping a few lines.....but ohhhh did I feel the addiction. I wanted more coke soo bad even though I didn't really 'get off' from it....it was weird...within the split second that coke went up my nose...all I could think about was more .. more. MORE!!", "When I went back home my girlfriend thought it was over between us because I kept blowing her off that evening (she didn't know I did it that night, but I kept pissing her off the whole night because i just wanted more coke). Well, as soon as I got things fixed with her I headed back to my friends apartment with 50$ for a half gram, but it was already gone. He told me to get a hold of him in the morning. All night and the next morning, I kept trying to decide if I should get more or not. I read many of the 'don't try it experiences' on this web site, but I still wasn't decided. I ended up going some where else to deliver some money for a future schwag/kind deal before getting a hold of the coke dealer. I was sure I was going to buy the coke...I was pumped.....but then as I arrived at the bud dealers house, I noticed a massive kind bud on the table. I was lucky enough to receive a few hits off this bud and then I suddenly realized what a fool I was. I was soo close to just throwing my money away on the half gram which wouldn't of even lasted the day, but with a little help from my friends and the God Cannabis, I made the RIGHT decision.", "After reading the many experiences on this page...mine doesn't even compare to all the others....but it also only took me ONE SMALL line and I almost lost my girlfriend and 50 bucks I desperately needed. I know it's all a matter a personal choice, but I'm glad my personal choice is to inhale a few delicious hits of extremely kind bud and actually be able to sit back and enjoy my 'own little world' for hours instead of snorting some bitter, half coke, half god knows what it was cut with, and become an edgy drug fiend for the night. Maybe I'm talking out my ass right now since I've never felt that 'incredible rush', but I might buy a gram this weekend for a much better price just to experience 'the rush' and sell the rest of it.

", "I first started socially using cocaine a few years ago. It was simple enough, easy to get, and after snorting a couple of lines, I felt great, and sex was awesome. Last year, I started using it on a regular basis, going through about two 8balls a week.(8ball=3&1/2 grams)with my boyfriend. After snorting it so long, my nose finally got really burnt out on it. I had nosebleeds alot, and my nose just hurt so much til I didnt enjoy the high anymore. I knew he had been into alot of shit in the past, so I suggested shooting it, instead. He was so against it, but finally gave in. We pulled some up in a syringe, injected it into my vein, and I finally knew what 'riding that train' truly meant. ", "I could hear the roar of a train so clear, I shook a little, and in a few minutes I was sortof speeding, but loving it. We both started running it, along with a couple of friends, there were good rushes, like that one, and bad ones that made us sick. There were ones that went in our veins smooth, and ones that leaked out, causing bad bruising, and numbness. One night, we had done close to a half of an 8, pulling up pretty strong hits, around 40cc, the more yellow it is in the syringe, the more potent it is. ", "My boyfriend did a hit, got up to wash the needle out and we heard him fall. I walked into hell when I walked into the bathroom that night. He was in a full blown grand mal seizure due to overdosing on it, too much too quick. The other guy with us got him up, got him in the car, all I knew to do was to get him cold, he had told me what he had to do years ago when someone he was with oded. After I got in the car with him to drive him to the er, he came to, slurring, disoriented, confused. The seizure lasted about 30 seconds, the disorientedness about 5 minutes, and within 15 minutes or so, he was ok. ", "He got into it really bad after that for a while, but the rest of us were scared into quitting that night. I didnt realise how addicting it was shooting it, snorting it never was addictive to either of us. He overdosed twice more during that time, the last time he wasnt breathing after the seizure, and I gave him cpr. He seems fine, I'm not sure if he ever suffered any small brain damage during all that or not. Even after a seizure, and scaring the hell out of everyone, he didnt quit. I almost called 911 last time, but he came to, so I waited. I would advise strongly against shooting it, sometimes you get good coke and sometimes you get really good almost uncut coke, the same amount of the uncut that you usually do with the regular could be an overdose. I've never seen or heard of anyone dying from snorting it, but shooting it, your playing with fire. ", "All 3 of his overdoses I've noticed came from hitting a main vein, rather than a deoxygenating one, which runs through your body first before going to your heart. A main vein, or artery, hits hard and quick, sometimes causing shaking, seizures, and worse. Also, it was after he had a good bit of coke in his system from previous hits, and doing hits too close together. As I said before, in any case, I wouldnt advise this method, you never know exactly how much your doing, and exactly which direction it will go in, and besides, you never get pure uncut coke, so you cant be sure what else your putting into your veins as well. Then you deal with hell itself. The craving and being short tempered, the always looking for that rush, you will never get one like the first one, we tried for so so long to. I shot coke for about 2 months, and I will always have a scar on my arm.He did it a good while longer, so his arms are really scarred, now I know what tracks are all about. I have to admit, the rush is good, but its not worth dying over. You can get the same rush from smoking a geek joint, laced with it, and I've never known any fatal effects from that either. I'm not saying there isnt, but I do know there are repeated fatal overdoses from shooting coke. ", "When injected, coke constricts the blood flow, which when shot quick and potent enough, can lead to what I've saw, or respitory arrest, your lungs freeze, or cardiac arrest, your heart stops. After shooting it for so long, your blood flow becomes difficult, and that fucks alot of things up for you. Other things you have to worry about with using a needle is hepatitis and air bubbles, if you have any air bubbles in the syringe and they are shot into your vein, you have really screwed up then, it goes to your heart. If your skin isnt completely germ free, you can get differnt infections also. The only good outcome I have in my experience was I did lose a few pounds I wanted to get rid of, but hell, a years supply of diet pills and a membership to a gym would have been less expensive. I really hope no one makes these mistakes we did.", "One night I had some of my older friends over at my house, my parents were away. I was looking to get high off acid or weed, but my friend Larry insisted that we get some coke. I agreed. The coke arrived and Larry crushed and prepared it, Danielle was so excited, she couldn't wait. I was scared, it did not want to get addicted to it, I just wanted to try it. When it was ready everybody snorted a line or two. It was my turn, I was so scared. I picked up the pen tube; held it to my nose and took a deep breath and snorted it. In less than five minutes I was jumping all over the place, it felt so good, I was so aware, so alive. When my 'high' finally wore off I begged and begged for some more. I wanted it so badly, just after one line (the first time too). Larry told me to calm down but I couldn't, I wanted some more so badly. ", "After awhile, after me nagging so much. He gave in and prepared more lines. This time I jumped right on it, the first to snort, I took in 5 lines. Shortly, I was jumping off the wall again. I wanted it so bad, there was nothing better than this feeling, i loved it. The drip was the only bad part. Larry light up and joint and I insisted he roll it in coke, so he did. Everything just seemed so much better at the time. ", "In the morning when I woke up. I had such bad side affects, I was so groggy. I had a horrible headache and I felt extremely nauseous. I could not get a hold of any more so I started snorting my Ridalin. It gave me a weaker experience but it worked. Soon I started snorting anything I could get my hands on: sugar, ridalin, prozac, and advil. ", "Now I can never stop thinking about it, its always a temptation to call a dealer and get some. I would do anything to get some coke. One time lead to another and that lead to many more. It always sticks in the back in my head now. I can not stop thinking about it. I want it more and more. Everyday I think of getting some, but I must learn how to get over my temptations. Cocaine changed my life forever, it will always not matter what stick in the back of my head. I will never completely forget about it.", "A few nights ago I met up with a close friend of mine and he informed me that he had purchased a half gram of cocaine.  Now, I had never done cocaine before and I was a little cautious about trying it.  Having heard all the horror stories of addiction on the first try and even death.  I trust my friend completely and asked him what coke was about, he never really gave me a straight answer, but that is exactly what i expected.  Later on that night we smoked a small amount of marijuana and about an hour later cut up the coke.  First he took a line, gave me a look of sheer pleasure and told me to have at it.  I eagerly took mine next.  A short time after I was feeling great.  ", "We sat down and just talked about all sorts of topics, our thoughts were racing and our mouths were just trying to keep up.  My mind had become clear, and all inhibitions had gone away.  My body was full of energy and at the same time completely relaxed.  Almost what i would call a euphoric experience.  ", "Once the drug started to wear off, I had the idea that more coke would be a really good idea, but we were out and that idea soon left my head.  Now, as i see it, coke has a bad reputation, and costs SO much money.  I have been told that I am very much in control of my mind, so I have hard time losing control with substances.  The times i have tripped LSD, not once have I lost it or freaked out.  To me it's the drugs, and they will wear off.  Coke is fun when it comes around, but as far as spending money on it, no way!  I am willing to using coke more, but only if it's free and only with the people i trust.  This is good advice for all.

Have fun = )", "O.k. I have to write this..... I've never had a problem with cocaine in 34 years. The 35th, however, saw me in what I like to call 'the choke'.", "The Choke defined: When you don't have any coke and you think about it at least three times an hour. Well, even when you have it you think about, it's just that when ya do, you can bump every time you think you want to.", "My problem started when I was able to score my own blow without having to include my hoover-fiance'. He's the type that scores the shit at 10 o'clock pm, and proceeds to party ALL of it, in HUGE lines until it's GONE at 4 am, then jones until 7 or 8 because he can't sleep. Forget keeping up with him, you'll give youeself a heart attack! And who wants to make themselves that miserable?", "So then comes the day that I can score without his knowledge and save the bag until the next day. Difficult, but let me tell you that knowing you got fresh un-touched teener will make your ass fly outta bed quicker than shit to get your face onto the plate! I've always liked the exclusivity factor of coke. The quick little trips to the bathroom to 'fix up your make-up a bit', and nobody's the wiser.", "Nothing is better than a bump at 7am. (and 7:30, and 8 and 10, and noon ha ha) You're already awake and that first line hits the back of your head and the rush is incredible!  And, when you live in a house full of Hoovers that are always eyeballing each other, and you, to see who's got the blow, those poor slobs are all at work so you can work your jaw and sniffle all day long without being suspect. Plus, I get soooo much stuff done! It's amazing!", "So I began tracking my usage on my calendar. Every day that I did cocaine I put a red X through the day. From Jan thru April I used on the average of four days every week. I was using any where from a teener to an 8-ball every week.", "Word of advice: Anyone who says that cocaine is not a dangerous drug hasn't done enough of it.", "I would use all day until my nose would 'break' (that's where your already ulcerated septum begins to sting and burn and you upper palate aches and throbs. The pain is incredible and if you don't have any kleenex you are fucked because your nose runs and drips uncontollably and you can't snort anymore to keep it numb so you have to wait it out). It happened in front of my future parents-in-law, I told them I had allergies. It happened at work and I told everyone I was coming down with a terrible cold. Then as soon as I was over the broken nose, I would take some nasal spray to open my sinuses so I could snort again, until my nose broke etc etc etc.", "This was starting to scare me. I felt that I may be addicted and was  amused in a dark, morbid sort of way, tried to quit, couldn't. Every Wednesday was when I paid for the successive weekend's blow; I would be ok until tuesday, then I'll be damned if I wouldn't find myself at the cash station on Wed am drawing out the money.", "The chick that I score from is a little coke-fiend too. I'll just refer to her as 'Eureka'. I always knew that she dug in my bag, which was no problem, since she's the one driving down there and risking her neck to pick up. I have a bright orange Z28, and if I'm the one who has to drive to get the shit, we're not getting any. Period. So does that make me addicted? If I can refuse on that basis? Who knows.", "Anyways, Eureka's digging started to get out of control. I would give her 80$ for a teener, she could combine that with 35$ of her money, 35$ from her coke-fiend boyfriend, get an 8ball then give me about 40-50$ worth and their broke asses would party all weekend, and still beg me for a bump here and there (you, know, since she scored for me and all.) So believe it or not, I quit just to watch those mother-fuckers jones! And jones they did, and still do, because I was always the backbone, the 'one-with-the-wallet'. So it took about a month for me to get out of the choke, I don't think about it as frequently any more. But still do want it none-the-less. But I just refuse to get ripped off any more so I'm safe. For Now.........", "I'll never forget the first time I tried cocaine. At first I was a little scared of it because my roomates would stay up half the night doing it. But I tried it non the less and I loved it! I'd never felt anything like it before. I can't compare it to anything else that I have tried. It is like drinking a lot of caffiene or a jolt cola. When I started doing it more and more people would ask me what it was like or they would tell me they wanted to try it. And all I could say about it was how great it is, how much fun it is. ", "So when one of my girlfriends was over at my house one day I had some and asked her if she'd like to try it. (I never liked doing it on my own. I also didn't like sharing it) and so she did. She loved it almost more then I did. All I could think at that time was alright, someone to split the cost with me. She did. And I then found myself only liking her when I was doing coke. I couldn't be friends with her or hang out with her without being high on it. ", "So that is what I mean by saying that it could happen to you. Coke is no good but yet people like me still do it. Still crave it. If you do read this please think twice. You never know what could happen. M", "I don't really know how to start writing this.  I just know that I should.

Someone whom I did not know showed up at the party and he had cocaine.  Everyone else was trying it, so, I thought, why not? As it ended up I did over 4 grams that night AND had sex with that guy. I didn't spend any money, he just wanted sex. I have never seen that guy again.  I do not remember his name, or even what he looks like.  I didn't even care. I just wanted more.  The feeling I got was extraordinary.  Everytime he cut me out a 'gator' my high returned, but less and less intense.  My body craved another line every 20 minutes or so.  He showed me how to put some in the end of my cigarette, a 'coolie'.  I heard it was like smoking crack. How did I manage to go from the most popular girl in school to a 'crack-head' in one night?", "As I look back, the first experience I had should have been devastating enough for me to never do cocaine again. But the feeling that I got overwhelmed my body and mind and I knew right then and there that this was just the beginning.  ", "Over the course of the next couple of years, I became a very avid user.

I remember just before I hit wondering why my friend was telling me I better not yell or scream. Then the world turned into joy. I thanked my friend for introducing me to cocaine and told him I loved him. Every noise was magnified a hundred fold and there was this beautiful echo on all sound. It was happiness in powdered form. This feeling of ultimate euphoria lasted about five minutes then an edge was taken off the intensity but for the next fifteen minutes I was still extremly high.

Instead, you can die trying to get it. ", "We're not on the streets, looking at us you wouldn't believe this, until you saw our arms, our legs, then you would know its true.

True, I'm not sure that craving ever goes away, if it does, it takes longer than months. A few months ago, a friend and his current girlfriend came by...wanting to know where they could hook up...that day, they had a few bruises from the needles, and that hungry look in their eyes...I saw them a couple of days ago, they had the scars, they both looked like death itself, the same wasted blank look in their eyes.

Then at other times, it comes crashing in my mind and screws up the whole day. Sometimes I wake up at night, shaking from the nightmares of what I've seen.

But shooting it is a one-way street to hell, from where not many come back.", "I had tried coke twice before w/ no effect, but I'll tell you about my third (and first successful) experience.  It was only last week actually.  Where I work, mostly people smoke weed, but I found out recently that coke was going around.  After being invited to try it the fist time and then getting some from a friend the second time, I thought that perhaps it just wasn't my drug of choice (pot btw).  A coworker started to sell it; so, I thought w/ it now being really close by, I would try again.  I bought a 20 bag and waited for a slow period.  When the others were taking a smoke break, I decided to take my break to the car.  ", "I emptied the bag and began to cut it.  Now I went against my normal smart advice and didn't do much research about coke.  I know a few people whose drug of choice is coke, but I stupidly didn't ask them too much.  So, I just separated it into two fat lines.  I rolled up a dollar and took them both in.  I never felt so good in my entire life!!  Nothing can really describe the feeling.  I pretty thought it was better than X except that it didn't last long enough.  I got a bit of nausea b/c I had taken waay too much.  It was wonderful.  Everything was brighter; people were warmer.  It was an empathic feeling.  I was told that I was moving around like a hummingbird for the most part talking a mile a minute.  ", "I would repeat the experience again and have done so.  I boght some more that evening, but I drew that out over a few days.  I love cocaine.  If I could afford it, I would do it more often.  Lucky for me, doing coke takes a backseat to paying the rent.

I felt so damn good...I could relate it to E but It was just a little different and a little better.  I took the last line as fast as I could without a second thought..", "I insisted we meet some 'girl' friends so we called some friends up and sped over to their place about 5 min away, the second I saw them I just started giving out hugs and remember saying the words 'I love you' and 'im sorry' over and over.

After that day coke has always been in my mind. Since I liked it so much me and my friend started to deal it and from the start I told my friend not to let it get out of hand. Well for about two weeks we would pick up coke and sell it on the side but we never made money off it. ( if you've done it you know exactly  how it goes, you always want a little bit more) Well anyways back to the story I didn't do it everyday along with my friend because I go to school and its pretty hard to get out of the bed in the morning when you only got an hour or two of sleep.

My friend was doing probably about an eightball a day and between pick ups my friend would just be fiending for coke and after I started to see the look in his eyes I knew he was hooked and it is really sad to watch one of your closest friends turn into a fiend.

This went on for about 4 months.", "Pretty soon it got to the point where I could not leave the house without 4 - 5 heavy lines.

I went crazy...first this guy at work offered me a quarter or about 8 lines so i took it but that was just to get me to come back. And, boy, did i come back. Alot. I pawned my VCR, my stereo, my cd's anything for that high. I was doing it every night and day on the hour...even at work. One Saturday night, me and a friend got 2 eight balls or about 30 lines or more. We decided to go clubing and do what we had in the bathrooms there. We danced and had a great time...i loved the shit out of that high. ", "Then, we ran out. So i went to my dealer and we went to a hotel at about 2:30 a.m. to party some more. He pulled out an ounce of cocaine and if u know about cocaine, u know that's alot of shit! So, we kept drinking and kept doing lines till i couldnt see straight anymore litterally. The room started shaking back and forth and i couldnt speak, i couldnt even go to the restroom...I knew my body was shutting down but i kept doing lines one after the other. Then, my best friend passed out and started convulsing on the bed. I lost it... we put her in the bathtub but it didnt help much. She was dying. Then, i blacked out and started convulsing into seizures just like her. When i woke up the next morning, i felt like shit, the worst feeling ever. I decided then to go clean.

I started off with about one line of coke, which I snorted about 3/4 of it, lost the rest cause it was my first time. I had been drinking earlier and after about 10 minutes I felt quite a bit more sober than earlier (noticeable difference) and my focus was quite good. I started playing video games with some friends and I was concentrating very hard without trying. While the clarity was nice the only other noticeable difference from my normal mindset was the actual adrenaline rush that it gives. It was just like drinking a lot of caffeine in my opinion. I did find I was quite a bit more relaxed during this period. I was also somewhat restless and moved about quite a bit. After about a half hour I snorted another line which was the rest of it and got all of it in. Again the clarity and the nervous energy. I spent most of my time hanging out outside, enjoying the cool breeze. ", "The only noticeable side affect that I could tell was that I started to sweat just a little. Other than that I didn't even get bad runs done the back of my throat. All in all a mediocre experience and certainly not worth paying for.

I appear to be doing alright, I even used to think I could just stop using coke when I wanted to, but I can't i still get sweaty palms and want to jump up and down at the thought of doing some. I don't use everyday but at least every other day, it is starting to really fuck up my life and I don't know what will happen to me.", "Please don't take this like I'm trying to be an after school special or something I just wanted to tell my story and tell you how much cocaine can mess with you even when you think your not an addict.", "The only reason I ever tried it was because my best friend did. She told me it was the best high I could have ever had. Since I'd done ecstasy and other stimulants before I was thinking this must be a great 'high' So I did it. I snorted 2 lines and only got 'numbies' so I took 2 more. And I was fucked. I felt like I was on top of the world. No one could make me feel bad. I must admit I loved it. There wasn't anything I didn't like about it except for the drip of course. So I went home that night still kinda messed up. I sat in my room and the only thing I could think about was more. I wanted more. Since I didn't pay for it I thought 'oh the next time I wanna do it it'll be easy to get.' I was wrong. The first time was only a 'sample' So I found money for it. My friends and I bought little amounts at first, then our tolerance rose and we needed more. One time I did it I went by this guys house and there was 10 other guys there. They told me they've never seen a group of girls do it so much. At the time I laughed. And the time after that I laughed. BUt one night as I was coming down. I realized it became the worst feeling ever. All I cared about was getting more. So I tried to go to sleep. I couldn't. My heart was racin, my pupils were huge, and I felt the urge to run around and act like I was 10. When I finally stopped coming down so hard, I fell asleep. When I woke the next morning I was just like 'fuck the world' I knew then that this was the beginning of an addiction. Sure I didn't need it, but I sure as hell wanted it. So I'm deciding to stop. I know I'll do it once and a while again, but I don't know if I could ever look at it again like I did before.", "I used to think coke was this magical drug that only movie stars could afford and it created feelings of pleasure so intense that it was up there with heroin.  After a few years of trying it I just realise that it is a flat out waste of money.  You are paying a ridiculous price for something that lasts about 30 min, whereas you can pay the same amount and get enough tweak to last for days.  ", "I dont see why people will say they hate tweak (amphetamines) and love coke, the high is almost identical!  Imagine snorting 4 lines and feeling like that for 6-8 hours!", "It's alright on very rare occasions, or if you just have a lot of money to waste.. It makes you feel like a champ, but why not pay the same price for something that will last 16x as long?", "I am what society would label as a typical yuppie. A 30 year old independent middle class woman whom had all the advantages of a spoiled and fortunate childhood. I started using drugs around 18 just for experimentation purposes, while all my friends where too scared or too reticent to try any new things I never possessed the fear of addiction or was scared off by horrifying stories told by worrisome parents and media. I first started smoking pot, and it was cool, but I always knew it was not my drug of choice. I tripped on mescaline, did shrooms, but they took over my thoughts and were too overwhelming for my tastes (more like dreams). I liked to keep my mind, sort of speak. I initially started snorting coke when I first met my X boyfriend (I was 18 at the time). I knew I found what I was looking for. I could now party all night with the best of them, I could drink and play poker till dawn while the rest of the crew crashed or hung over the toilet puking their shots up. ", "Let me just state for the record - this is not a sad sob story and I don't end up an addict begging you not to make the same mistakes I did. On the contrary - I want to convey to the world that there are people who can use cocaine whom can wake up the next day and not want more. Actually after a night of partying the last thing I want to do is more coke. I want to hang out recuporate all day and watch TV - coke is the farthest thought from my head the day after. Most of the time while coming down I think to myself why the fuck did I do this - I can't sleep, it is 5:00 AM and the sun is coming up and I have such a headache. That is the worst part of cocaine - the coming down - it is not so much at that point you want more because at that point it is over but you feel like you are in between. Your body is fatigued and you want to sleep but your heart is racing, your mouth is dry, your lips feel like they are going to fall off and your eyes are so bloodshot that you don't even wanna look in the mirror. Sounds pretty pathetic, huh? But you finally fall asleep and wake up about 5 PM the next day, you take a shower and considering you haven't eaten-you raid the fridge. Sometimes it is worse than others - sometimes if you drink enough and snort in the beginning of the night you can actually pass out and sort of bypass the 'coming down'-that is what I strive for on my weekend party extravaganzas. ", "Why do I do it? Because nothing in the world feels better than snorting your first line! You get psyched just thinking about it! It gets you going and as far as all you 'potential addicts' are concerned - I think it starts in your mind.I mean I am not saying that when you are actually doing the drug you don't always want another line-because you do - but waking up the next morning and wanting to get high again I just can't fathom. If you know you have an addictive personality this is surely not the drug for you. But for those of us whom can deal with the 'weekend usage for recreational purposes' it is absolutely the ultimate partying tool.", "Ok, one night I was with a couple friends at their apartment smoking some kind bud. And I guess the topic of doing coke came up (I was later told that I had brought it up). Staci has done it many times before, Shaun only a couple. So anyways, Staci said she would try to get some.", "So the next day I go back to their apartment and they have half an 8-ball. Sixty bucks for a bag that small??!! Jesus H Christ! So anyways, Staci and I do a key bump, while Shaun says he is gonna wait until after he eats. When I snorted the bump, there were like these chunks stuck in my nose. Well anyways, we went to get something to eat, the whole time being very attentive to my body and any changes that might occur (even though it was only a 'key bump'). Nothing really unusual. Maybe a little energetic. ", "So we get back to the apartment and after 5 minutes we start doing it. The old 'What am I doing??' thought came to mind but I just blocked it out. We each took turns doing a line every couple minutes or so while we played Street Fighter II on the Playstation.", "Maybe after a couple minutes I felt a little more energetic. I could definitely feel its effects, but it was not like I had heard or had hoped. One annoying thing about doing coke is the nasty bitter taste in the back of your throat. Bad, but not too bad. Tastes like you just chewed up and swallowed an aspirin. After an hour all the coke was gone. Shaun and I kept saying 'What?? This is it?? Definitely overrated.' while Staci was on the phone trying to get more. She said it worked on her good, although one could not tell a difference just by looking at her.", "Either we did not do enough, the stuff we did was not strong enough, or some people just do not get affected as easily, but we eventually ended up going to get more. Shaun and I are very analytical people, always trying to analyze anything and everything while stoned (as I am sure a lot of people do.)I decided not to do anymore because I did not think it would really do anything plus the nasty bitterness in the back of the throat feeling, but eventually ended doing more hoping it WOULD do something. Of course it did no more than keep me alert and somewhat energetic, but that's it.", "I did notice I was getting a little annoyed when Shaun kept scraping the remaining coke into a pile over and over and over )And it is hard for me to get annoyed). I also noticed I did not talk any more than usual, as opposed to Staci and Shaun who were talking constantly about nothing, which also annoyed me. We had some kind bud to do, and I was glad to do it for that is something I could actually feel. It calmed me down and immediately got rid of the anxious feeling I had on coke.", "All in all, I just gotta say coke is definitely not worth it to buy or for that matter do, unless of course it is your first time and you want to see what it is like, and you don't have to pay for it. Who knows? It may be different for you. But if you have heard and seen as much hype as I have on the stuff and eventually do it....you will see for yourself. You might be in for a big let down.", "Of course, like I said before, maybe the stuff we did was not as good as it could have been. But I now see how cocaine can ruin someone's life. It ruins it by making them spend their money over and over again trying to make the damn stuff work!!", "It's not cool, it's not clever and it's expensive.  We all know the stories about drugs and how they fuck you up, but still you have to try it and you do deny it's doing you harm.", "Last year I had a big pay off from my employer and I thought, yeah why not?  I'll buy some coke.  Three and half grams was a cheap deal so that's what I bought.  I didn't last long and me and my grilfriend loved it.  We always have loved it.  But when that had run out, I went again, every other I went for about three weeks.  By this time I had lost weight, me and my girlfriend were arguing about it constantly and money wasn't an issue, but my health, my work and my relationship were going down hill.  For three months solid I bought coke every week and there was not a  day when I hadn't had a line.  Money was still not an issue but my life was.  ", "I enjoyed it, but I just remember polishing off three and half grams in one day and being so fucked all I do was sit in front of the tv, my jaw going mad, sweating and trying to calm it down by smoking joints, but that was useless.  I couldn't face anyone, I was a recluse in my own home, scared to answer the phone and scared to answer the door.  So I stopped and all I could think of was calling my dealer and sorting out some more.  I haven't touched it for about 6 months, although I want to.  I did try and sort some out last week, but my dealer couldn't sort it out in time.  I saved money and I felt better.  Coke changes you, even if you don't think it does, or you don't care, it does.  It will change you and you won't like who you become.", "It started like any other day, just hanging out with my friends getting ready for a New Year's party.  We were all excited about it.  We weren't sure who'd be there and were surprised when we found out.  We arrived at the party and checked it out to see who was there.  We saw our friend, who we knew was heavily into drugs, and a couple of other people we recognized.  The party was getting started and we were ready to have fun so we got some beers, Boone's Farm, and Sevens.  It was great.  I started getting a little tipsy after a few drinks. Then I drank more and more until I was in total oblivion.  I had no idea what was going on.  The night was a blur, but I remember a little.  First, I walked in the kitchen and my druggy bud was snorting a line.  I asked her how to do it and she explained, so I tried. It tickled a little then I felt so good. It lasted for about 30 minutes. Then I wanted it more and more. I was ready to do anything for it.  By the end of the night I had snorted at least 6 lines that I remember. I probably did more than that but it isn't very clear to me. ", "Snorting Cocaine was the biggest mistake of my young life.  If I hadn't felt so bad the next morning I would probably still do it.  Luckily, I didn't suffer anything unbearable. I know I will never do it again.", "My experience with cocaine is much like every other addict's.  useless. To even consider doing this drug more than once in a while is asking to become addicted. The first time i ever did coke was when i was sixteen.  My mom's boyfriend gave me about the equivalent to 4 or 5 lines in the span of an hour.  The first time is always wonderful, but its never the same.  ", "Soon I got depressed and started to value things a lot less, I didn't even  know myself anymore.  After i initially was introduced to cocaine, i thereafter began to do it every day. and if i didn't have it i was a nervous wreck.  I chewed all of my finger nails off and threw up at the thought of more cocaine.  During the summer, why i still don't know, i just up and moved across the country...for some reason that i don't even know.  ", "I guess i knew that i had no hook up for coke there so in two days i had moved out of some crazy idea i had.  I stayed with my parents for a month and a half and went through all of the withdrawls, and no one truely knows what cocaine withdrawls are like unless you have been through them.  It was horrible, like a bad dream.  I am writing this submission in hopes that someone like me will read this and realize that cocaine does change people drastically and to think first before you try it.  If you cannot handle it or even if you have doubts about if you will not have the power to stop after you start then dont even try it.  And what is the point of paying someone so much money to make you sick and give you one of the hugest obstacles that is imaginable.", "I have now been coke free for 8 months. I abused cocaine for around 3 and 1/2 months and i still crave it sometimes and i still bite my nails when i think about it, but now i have realized that cocaine is truely useless.", "I had just broken up with my boyfriend who had been addicted badly to cocaine before we ever met, but I had never tried it.  I was totally depressed, and hated the fact that we had broken up, so I decided to make myself feel better. One of my girlfriends said that it would be a good idea to do some coke that night, no doubt it would make me feel better, she said. ", "Well, I did.  Over the next two months it was all I could look forward to every weekend.  Doing those beautiful, white, crystalline lines that I loved so much to break up, and then lick the card which I had done it with. Numbies, man I loved the numbies.", "The next morning, after doing coke, my jaw would hurt from grinding my teeth, my mouth would be dry from talking so much, and I felt really bad about myself and who I was becoming, becuase I didn't give a fuck about anyone else but myself, which wasn't much like me.  Eventually, my boyfriend came back around to me, and I stopped using. (I should say I let him come back around.) But everytime I see it, smell it, or hear someone talk about it, my mouth waters, and I wish I had some in front of me, to make me feel so 'high.'", "I'd chipped around with coke, but until I'd injected some, I'd never known its complete effects.  Injecting coke is completely different than snorting.  I've heard that smoking crack is similar, the same tinnitus (ringing in the ears), but I've never gotten that high off smoking, nor trusted anyone who could score that urban trash, nor liked having to score the way crackheads score--one piece at a time.  I'd done time in prison for psilocybin, so my connections were good.  I prefered to score an ounce at at a time, sell off my cost plus a slight profit.  Then, I'd acquire a box of fresh needles, sterile cotton balls, distilled water, and a clean spoon. ", "Shooting coke is a progressive vice.  When you're young, stupid, and the coke's good, a very little amount will send you over the edge.  As your tolerance builds, and your experience in the altered universe of coke dementia increases, one finds themselves able to quell the panic of immediate onset.  The rush of a fresh shot insights panic to the layman; but the experienced user wants to ride the cliff, to risk missteping into overdose.  To hear the 'train', the aluminum sound of the world being crushed--like the 'green room' of surfing, the sound of water on fire with the tap running slightly in the bathroom.  To look at death, to think that if I just stop concentrating, I might die; that's the buzz.  It's the urban shaman, the risk of death....stupid and exhilarating.  ", "I don't recommend shooting ANYTHING...to anyone.  First, it's bad karma.  Secondly, I'd hate to condemn someone else to the craving nightmares and the sick game of wanting something SO EMPTY.  I know that, regardless, some will push the envelope and want to try 'The Forbidden'.  So, all those other little rich kids (you know who you are), at least follow these rules if you're going to do it:", "1.  Fresh needles.  One use and then bend the needle, recap and put in an empty liquid detergent container that will be duct-taped later so some poor guy, only doing his job, won't get a bad surprise.", "2.  If possible, try it with an experienced user.  ", "3.  Try a test shot before trying to 'shoot the moon.' Why overdose when the second shot can be The Shit?", "4.  Don't turn anyone on.  The first 20 times you do it, you think you've found something great that the world should know about.  If there was ever a forbidden fruit that most people should avoid, it's this bullshit.

And I am not saying that *your* trip will be like this...remember to know your mind, body, substance, and source.", "My first experience happened at a goth club with my close friend at the time.  I had never taken part in the wondrously white realm of coke before, so was curious but scared as hell to try it out. We did two lines apiece, but nothing happened for me.  I was just all numb, and the drip was gross as all hell in a handbag.  She, on the other hand was really grooving on the stuff.  So, about a half an hour later we did some more, etc. etc.  And so on throughout the entire night.  I had probably snorted eight lines in the course of two hours.  All I felt was my heart pumping a bit, and then I got super annoyed with everyone...but in now way craved anymore.", "My second experience involved snorting a LOT of coke throughout a span of three hours...for awhile I was 'up', but I could't really tell if it was my mind telling me that I should be feeling slightly fucked, what with all of the shit I had been putting up my nose, or if something was *actually* happening.  We ran out early in the morning and it took forever to get to sleep.", "The last time I have used it was relatively close to the other experiences (all within three months of one another), and still nothing really happened.  I even snorted fat lines... Is there such thing as cocaine immunity?  Everyone else was raving about how 'good' the coke was, but I was just in my own land! Which I suppose is a really good thing, as I never craved it *once*, or settled into it's deathlike habit.  ", "However, be careful.  I've seen my friends get very fucked up on this white fairy, and I don't speak with many of them anymore because they are so far gone, and have pushed away all attempts of help.

Well we all snorted a fair share each there were 4 of us so we had about 10-15 bumps a piece and we were flying high we sat there and talked 100 words a second and smoked about 4 packs of cigarettes each in about the 3 hours the 8-ball lasted. well at this point we were fiending pretty hardcore so i developed a good cure we rolled two joints one with some coke and a regular bone. We smoked both at the same time goingback and forth and while the coke joint suppressed our hunger the regular joint made our low not as bad the pot kicked effect and we all fell asleep and the next morning i never felt better in my entire life since i was up for 20 some hours and waking up at 8am for my first class i woke up refreshed and energized and never had urges to do coke all the time.

I had tried acid in high school and decided that it wasn't for me.  I very much enjoyed shrooms and pot in college, and still do on occasion today.  I felt I had been ''round the block.'  Recently I discovered the dance culture and all things associated with it.  Ecstasy has been a lot of fun, though I think I have a handle on it - can't exactly afford to be 'slow' the next day when you're striving to make it in the New Economy and don't want to burn too many brain cells.  One night while partying, I was offered coke.", "Despite the fact that I had been against it, I decided it was time to give it a go.  I could no longer tell my friends who were casual users not to partake if I had no idea what they were talking about.  Despite my fears of addiction, heart attack, and death, I had my first bump in a warehouse bathroom towards the end of a party.  Needless-to-say, I survived.", "It's been mixed feelings ever since.  I've become a more regular user with a lot more friends giving it a go as well.  I never wake up in the morning after a night of partying feeling like I need a line to get things going and I don't crave it all the time.  Then again, I can't go out to a bar or party and not think, 'Hey, this scene would be a little bit better with some coke going around.'  It's just how it is.  Not to get religious, but reminds me of the Biblical story of Adam and Eve.  Once they tasted the fruit, they could never go back.", "My experience is this.  I can now understand how a person can be pushed past better judgement seemingly against their will by a drug.  Use it only with friends in a fun atmosphere and only every so often.  I have had the experience of solo useage and it can make things unpleasant to say the least.  I can see how a person can lose control, and though it may seem a release at times, it can end up becoming quite frightening.", "I've done a lot of things in my day, and coke is without a doubt the most addictive substance I've encountered (I've heard heroin is truly the most and I refuse to cross that line).  Use only with caution and care.  One slip and you can find yourself wondering what you've become.  I know.  I've been there and back.

For instance my first time with Coke was a fun experience, I tried it, liked it and didnt get too much of a come down and that was that.  At the time it was a great high but I only had 3 lines so it wasnt the smack in the face impact I was expecting although I remembered very clearly how it made me feel.", "Several months later I lost a best friend through suicide which kind of fucked everybody up.  I was seeing my friends crying, arguing and fighting amongst themselves over stupid things and I just didnt want to be a part of it.  So I thought I would try coke again just to get me through the next weeek or two as I remembered the feeling of euphoria which made everything ok for a while. ", "I got my hands on a gram which I thought would be enough for a few days but it only lasted till that night but that wasnt a problem I found out that a friend of mine was pals with a dealer so I got another gram the next day.  Two weeks on I found myself falsely coping with everything around  me and I was spending a fortune on Coke but I still didnt think I had a problem.  I would tell myself I had better stop or I willl become an addict, so I could stop,  but it was only till the next day when I realised that I wanted more.  The highs I experienced were immense,  felling like there was nothing that could get me down and I would get along with everybody, I was... well in heaven, but I found out to my harm that once you were up there you couldnt get any higher no matter how much you could take.  ", "Now I was starting to get worried so I turned to someone who I thought was a friend and explained to them and only them that I was constantly on coke.  All I wanted from telling this person was someone who would listen to me and not freak out.  But days later another one of my 'friends' came up to me and asked if I was on coke.  So, I am paranoid person as it is, when I heard this I started freaking out about who knew and who would find out so I fell out with nearly all of my friends and got really heavy into it.  It got so bad my nose would bleed for about an hour solid beause I couldnt be bothered cutting my stuff properly.  I also wouldnt leave my room unless it was for coke because I was so paranoid I thought everybody in my work and my town were talking about me, trying to get me to admit I was a junky.  ", "Then one day I flipped completely got 2 G's cut them, lined them out and started snorting as much as I could, line after line only stopping to allow my nose to clear so I could start again.  After an hour I passed out and woke up in hospital with tubes in my nostrils and down my throat.  I couldnt speak for about a week after because too much coke went down my throat and burnt tiny holes all over.  To this day there are still people I can hear whispering when I walk past them, I know I had a problem and I know that I will never take it again but it proved me wrong that no matter how strong I thought I was, under the wrong circumstances I could and did become addicted to something.", "I don't really know how this all got started but it seems like too much has happened in such little time. In the past two months I have went from trying cocaine for the first time to becoming so addicted I can't even lie to myself about the addiction anymore. In the beginning me and about 2 or 3 friends would purchase a gram and we would be set for the night. It would make me feel so good. I felt such confidence and that is great because i have no self-esteem what so ever and i tried my whole life to feel some and all i had to do now was sniff some powder up my nose and i would feel as if i was on top of the world! Everything felt great from taking a walk, smoking a ciggarette, to scratching my head! Then quickly I would want some everyday and it didn't help that i had 2 feening friends thinking the same thing. So within at least one week we went from a gram a night to about 200 dollars worth of coke in one night!

My father passed away a year ago and my mother kicks me out my house every other week, I never go to school and had to agree to see a therapist weekly and was put on anti-depressants (that by the way i refuse to take)in order to be taking out a mental hopsital my mom put me in. And now that i can now admit that i'm officaly addicted things have only become worse. I come down hard even a few minutes after i take a couple lines i freak out if I don't sniff some more right away and when it's all gone i go and buy more until my nose is all stuffy and bloody that i can't sniff anymore even if i tried, only then will i decide i should go home.", " Once i'm home i can't sleep and can't do anything but cry and become so depressed and suicidal and think about my life and how I'm fucking it up so lovely and how i'm just living this one big lie, i even lie to the therapist i see every week. Besides the mental part my body feels like it's wasting away. I've lost 15 pounds in the last month, i have to sleep with my mouth open because i can't breath through my nose anymore. Besides needing cocaine everyday to maintain i need caffiene pills to stay awake and nasal spray to try to clear my nose after averaging about a box and a half of tissues full of blood and mucus.

It's like a sick nightmare that I can't get out of so I'm just here sitting here feeling so helpless", "I was introduced to coke 6 months ago. Since then I have battled in my mind as to whether or not I should keep doing it. I have occasionally done ecstasy and speed for the past 5 years and do really enjoy the highs that these drugs give me, so I was more than interested in trying cocaine when my boyfriend suggested that we get some. After tentatively snorting my first lines, I began to feel confident and very talkative. My first night on coke was a good one. I now like to do coke every weekend. Being an intelligent 22 year old female, I know the risks of doing these drugs and I choose to take them.", "My main reason against doing cocaine is not the health problems or worry of addiction, but is that I am always waiting for the weekend to get high. When Monday comes I can't wait till friday, and the days become a chore. I want to be able to enjoy every day of my life and achieve my ambitions, but at this rate I will stay in a minimum wage job for the rest of my life waiting for my highs. I know I could make the decision to stop right now if I wanted to, take control of my life and start enjoying it, but I don't want to. I love getting high. One day I am going to have to make a choice and I know what the answer will be, but until then, I guess all my life will be is a mixture of good times on the weekends and some serious under-achieving.", "I started to snort cocaine about a year and a half ago it started with smoking pot and a friend of mine offered some coke to me and i agreed to take it.  After six months of it i realized that i was hooked on it so for the past year i have been quitting. just last week i threw away the last of my shit and it has been hell but i think that i can make it.  nobody really knows about it but a few close friends who have been very supportive of me quitting. i finally told my girlfriend about it and we agreed to break up till i got all the way clean. i hope and i pray that i can come clean and finish college and put it all behind me. if anyone reads this don't even start. it only takes one time and it ruins your life so bad it's not as good as it sounds and it's not cool you'll just end up hiding it from your friends and being ashamed of it", "I recently began using cocaine on what has become a frequent basis.  My boyfriend introduced me to it, and the two of us regualarly use, but our usage is not based on addiction and we still go about our responsibilitys and live full lives. I had always had a mindset that cocaine was an addictive drug, and always thought of it as one of the worst drugs, ranking it with heroin.  Once I did it though, my thoughts have completely changed.  I initially worried about addiction, and overdosing, and can understand how a person might find themselves in theses situations, because it makes you feel good, and who doesn't want to feel good?. I believe though, that when used as a reward for a hard worked week, or a stress reliever to unwind, the idea of an out of control addiction is not a possibility.  This drug cannot just take over your mind, unless you let it.  ", "I have found it to be wonderful in my relationship with my boyfriend.  We talk for hours when we use, and wherever we are, or what were doing, the cocaine makes it enjoyable.  We do use frequently, but limit our use to weekends and special occasions.  Used in this manner, it becomes an enjoyable experience, and something to look forward to.  The reason for the existance of drugs such as cocaine, is for enjoyment.  When they are used for enjoyment, and you set your mind up to understand that they won't last forever, you can use and still live life to the fullest.", "The first time I experienced cocaine, I was 14 years old. Out of the blue, one of the older kids in my neighborhood said he was buying some and asked me if I was interested. So we went to this guy's house and he scored it. We went into the guy's cellar and broke it out. I did two lines, and I was racy and my throat was numb, but I couldn't really get a grasp of the high. I didn't do coke for two and a half years after that.", "In July of 1998 it was my birthday and I was real drunk, and one of my buddies was selling coke at the time, and I bought a gram. I did two lines and it was like I never even drank any liquor, I was straight. I did two more and I felt absolutely invincible. I found myself spending another seventy dollars that night on it.", "By the time I knew it, three weeks had gone by and I was doing yayo (coke) every day, spending about a hundred dollars a day on my habit, and I was dealing weed so the money was easy to get, and a couple of people sold coke.", "I went on a series of being straight one week, and fucked another, finding myself taking heavy amounts of LSD and doing a lot of coke, at the same time. I eventually could not sleep at night, and stopped going to school. I was a mess, and I had to do something about it, so I cleaned up. ", "I was clean for about a year and a half, and it felt good. All of my friends had stopped too, but it struck again. I started selling coke, and then my drug of choice was ecstasy, so I didn't touch it. Two weeks later me and my best friend were sitting in my room, fucked on like three ecstasy hits apiece. I was bagging some coke up and for some reason I got really tempted. I said something to my friend, who was also a recovered user. We ended up doing all of the coke that I had. We stayed up for fourteen hours and did about thirty lines apiece (4.5g). After that we did it for about two  months, spending anything we had, going through at least forty lines a day. I started developing chest pains, but the high was overpowering me. I could not stop. I was really agitated all of the time, and fighting with my mother. ", "And now it is a year later. I am almost nineteen years old and doing well. I HOPE to never cling on to coke again, but one can never say when you are caught in the grasp of the yayo.", "When I first began doing cocaine, it made the world become what I always felt it should be. It made me feel like I was playing a role I always felt I couldn't quite grasp. Everything I thought and felt on the inside became a reality on the outside. I looked better, I felt like superwoman, I was better than my sober best could ever be, words flowed, I was ON all the time. I figured that life wasn't worth living without the drug, because how could it do me wrong when it was doing me so much good. ", "I ignored warnings from my friends about the damage it would cause to body and brain, and that I would suffer in my life from all directions if I kept abusing the drug. But I was having an absolute blast, I didn't care if I was spending all my money, I didn't care that every night when I went home my nose would start aching ferociously, or that I would lie in bed for hours clenching my teeth, and cursing about everything around me. ", "Soon the come down from cocaine became too powerful for me to endure, so I started buying sleeping pills, and creams for my nose, and pain killers, and then I stole tons of the highest dose of valium I could find from a friend, which would knock me out literally for 24 hours.   ", "A few months into my addiction I could not take a step out of bed without having one or two lines...sometimes I would have a huge line in hopes to wake up and I would fall right back asleep. I stole things from my family and pawned them to get money for cocaine. I took a job as an exotic dancer to support my habit and quickly my life became a horrible cycle of working to support my habit, and using in order to go to work. I started becoming bitchy and petty, and so incredibly self absorbed, everyone around me kept telling me that I was behaving like a crazy loser. ", "One time I ended up getting caught in a strip club with no cocaine and no money, so I prostituted myself for 2 grams, and 200 hundred dollars, and I was so mad at myself when I went home that I snorted the two grams in three hours in the morning by myself. My life became so dark, that eventually it hit me that either I stop and fix my life, or watch myself slowly dwindle away, or create a less painful end, and kill myself immediately. ", "Obviously I chose the first option. It was not easy...I could not function for a month and a half without cocaine, and I had to fight like hell not to fall into the pattern again, but once you come out of the drug induced haze you start realizing that drugs suck, and you see what an ignorant fool cocaine reduces you to, all while making you think that you are in control. My advice to anybody who touches that drug...It will take away from you as a person, just as much as it seems to give to you, if not more. It is a beautiful apple filled with worms, you will gain nothing from using it...stay away -- we all have enough problems in our lives, Cocaine is bigger than all of yours put together."], "dxm": ["Last night was the last time I'll ever do DXM.  For the most part I have had pretty good experiences, although the effects started to lessen the more I did it.  I had been looking forward to last nite for awhile in hopes of having a nice trip.  I went out with my friend to go see a movie after ingesting about 500mg of DXM.  I don't quite remember how soon the effects started, but one thing is, neither of us remember the movie at all.  We tried to talk to each other during the movie, but found it very hard to do so at times.  ", "Once the movie was over, we attempted to leave, finding it pretty hard to walk by this point.  We got to the car and just sat in it for at least 20 minutes.  There was a huge truck parked next to us, and looked so close to our car.  We couldn't even back out of the parking space because the truck was so close and we feared that other cars would be coming down the parking lot and hit us.  Finally some people came out of the theater and got in the truck and left.  We could finally leave and get to my house since we had no clue what else to do.

I felt like I was floating in the air and not touching the ground at all.  I think we tried to talk to each other, but I don't know what about.  After a while my friend left to go home.  I felt really weird after this; I couldn't think or see straight and my heart felt like it was pounding.  I tried to get a reasonable amount of sleep, but I still felt very tired after waking up.  I also felt completely worthless.  I felt like there was no point to anything anymore, especially taking DXM.  I got nothing out of last nite; I don't remember a lot of it.  I am never touching DXM again.  I find absolutely no point in it at all.", "Would there be many of you who agree with me on dxm being more of a substance to learn from than a physical nonbeneficial experience. The further I experimented with it, the better I started understanding it. Of course, this is probably not the case for everyone, but for the most part, its a neutral unbiased inhibition release(for me). I usually feel rather dynamic and alert while robotiking. It wasnt always like that; when I first started, it was just an alternative for unavailable psychedelics, and comparing it as so, the experience seemed rather wasteful. After a few wastes, I started getting the hang of it. And what started as a heavy<- ambience changed to an aid in logic and performance. It has also allowed me to repattern my metabolism to some extent. I have less of an appetite and feel more efficient in movement. ", "========================================================================", "You are first person to affirm my own experience with DXM. I felt like it raised my IQ by 10 points (but I don't believe in the concept of 'IQ' at all). In a low dose, it seems to open dormant areas of my mind, so I can see things more clearly. I thought it might be a fortuitous drug interaction, as I am also taking an antidepressant, Effexor (venlafaxine). What dose were you using? I think about 200 to 250mg is about right. More than this gives too much LSD like effect, and my fantasties begin to seem more real, which can be dangerous. I'm also not sure about the duration of the effect; it seems to be rather prolonged; I'm not sure it entirely wears off at all, which is a good thing for me. It is unfortunate that most of the dxm available is combined with much more toxic drugs (such as acetaminophen, pseudoephedrine, antihistamines, and even alcohol-although in minimal amounts). I think this accounts for some of its bad reputation on the net, as well as the fact that the high doses often suggested make one nonfunctional. The intermediate doses make me more functional. I think it should also be tested as a treatment for dementia, particularly Alzheimers disease, at this dose level. ", "Philadelphia, Pa. USA 3/13/93.

The Ghostly beings were looking at me and I could here them trying to communicate with me, but the only thing I could understand was that they wanted my to close my eyes and rest. I trusted them.

", "I made sure to have a good day, and not to fight with my parents.  I meditated shortly before the Simpsons, clearing my head, and decided that I had had an excellent day.  I believe that any and every high is half mental, and with the right attitude, I find that I can make the weakest high become as good as any. After watching the Simpsons (a very funny episode that put me in an even better mood), which ended at 8:00, I immediately consumed one and a quarter bottles of Robitussin Maximum Strength.  I retired to my bedroom to read 'The Beach' and await the experience. ", "At about 8:40, I started to feel a grass-like buzz, and decided I would stop reading and just lay on my bed.  I turned all my lights off, and layed still in the darkness.  On my stereo played The Doors.  Ironically, 'the End', the trippiest song ever was playing as my trip began. It was 8:45 and my ceiling began turning different shades of black.  It would lighten, almost to white, and then go to gray and eventually to black again.  I put my hand up in front of my face and saw it light up, and then become engulfed in shadows.  I gathered my wits enough to call my friend Steven, who I asked to help me out with the experience.  Motion had a very special effect, and as I picked myself up to dial, I was shocked out how much I liked it.  From that point on, I was rolling in my bed almost the entire time. I talked to Steve for a while, telling him how I felt.  I lost my perception of time.  I told him I thought we had been talking for an hour, and in truth it was only ten minutes. At this point, 8:55, I noticed my door.  Around the outside of my door frame was a very bright light, like a fluorescent light.  It was continuous and traveled around the entire frame of my door.  In the middle of it was very dark.  It seemed my door had turned into a portal.  I looked into the portal, but it was too foggy to see, like a mixture of black and gray.  This intrigued me, but I got distracted by Steve, and a friend we had called on three-way.", "It was then that I brought my attention back to my door.  The light around it had slightly diminished.  I wondered why, but as I gazed towards the portal, I understood.  In the middle was the blackest thing I had ever seen, similar to a black hole.  I quickly stopped rolling in my bed and stayed silent until Steven queried me. 'Steve, my friend,' I said, 'I'm staring into the infinite darkness.' I stared deep into the void, and everything around it disappeared.  It was intensely beautiful, and for a moment, nothing even existed aside from myself and the darkness.  I then saw two red eyes glowing at me.  I was horribly afraid, and decided to turn away.  I was sorry to do it, but it was more instinct then anything.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to reproduce the feeling quite as strongly as this one time. I started talking to Steve again, and we tried to call another friend, who unfortunately was not home.  We just sat and talked and laughed a bit.  I felt as if the phone had suddenly become huge.  The end in which I talked was so large that I could lay on it, and the handle had stretched enough to let me listen and talk at the same time.  I felt that everything in my room was a mile away, and I had suddenly shrunk.  This was highly pleasant.  It wasn't actually a hallucination, more like a strong day dream. It was about 10:20 when Steve and I hung up. ", "My father called me downstairs to help me move a refrigerator.  When I got up to walk, I felt very drunk.  I stumbled in the darkness, and broke through the portal, out into the hallway.  I had been very afraid of going through the portal, but as I blindly stumbled, I slipped right through it.  I fell down a few stairs and started to giggle.  I got up, and found that by opening my eyes wide, I could walk straight for a little while.  I walked down and helped my father (the refrigerator was on wheels, so I had little trouble), and then went back upstairs.  I got into my bed for some introspection and meditation.  I got up, to see how well I could control my walking.  With concentration, I could walk straight for a full minute, as timed on my clock radio.  When I did not concentrate, I swaggered wildly.  And when I just let go of myself, I began bumping into walls and falling numerous times.  It was fun, but I didn't want my parents to see me.  I want back to my room and layed on my bed.  I fell asleep at about 11:30, as I was very tired from soccer earlier. I had some visions while I was asleep, of things that had happened previously.  ", "I was thinking of the infinite darkness when my mom woke me for school. I showered and had a cup of black coffee, which helped to wake me up.  I was very groggy, and if I let myself go, I even felt dizzy.  I got to the train station and smoked a strong unfiltered cigarette, which significantly cleared my head.  I felt much better, and could not wait to tell my friends of my night. My experience was highly enjoyable.  I went into it with a good mindset, and came away with a great experience.  The only aftereffect was my exhaustion, which gradually receded over the school day", "The subject had heard the rumors about the psychoactive potential of DXM for years before, out of sheer boredom, experimentation with the material was undertaken. The subject was quite experienced in the realm of entheogenics, with the following experiences under his belt:", "-Psilocybin; including a 5+ gram psilocybe mushroom trip", "-DPT; The subject has binged on this mind bender many times", "-XTC; multiple double drops and one triple drop trip", "-Ketamine: Both via insufflation and I.M.; heroic doses", "     So, the subject was certainly in a position to pass judgement on the relative worth of DXM. The first experiment involved the consumption of a 4 oz bottle of cough syrup containing only DXM as the active ingredient. Subject was careful to avoid medicines which combine DXM with such nasty additives as acetaminophen, pseudoeffedrine, guaifenesin etc.", "     The red, sticky syrup was painfully consumed in approximately 10 minutes. Over the next two hours or so, the only noticeable effects were ever growing nausea, bloating and an annoying sense of fatique. Near the end of this period however, the subject entered a fast food restaurant so as to ammend themselves of the facilities. At this point, for a brief spell, the only 'psychoactive' aspect of the experience was realized, which consisted of a vague sense of confusion upon entering the restaurant. The sensation bore a vague, superficial resemblance to a low dose of Ketamine though it was in no way enjoyable or interesting. This feeling dissipated once the subject left the restaurant and within a half hour or so the subject was more or less at baseline.", "     This experience left the subject with little interest in DXM or with any desire to explore the substance further. A couple of years later however, while perusing the net, the subject happenned across a series of articles on DXM experiences which reawakened his interest in the material; particularly the 'DXM FAQ' which outlines various dosage levels and plateaus of experience. The subject thought to himself '...maybe 4 oz's in a stomach presoaked with beer-", "isn't a fair trial...' and decided to give it another whirl. This time two 4 oz bottles were consumed, which should have provided a mid range experience according to most of the stuff circulating the net. The psychoactive effects that resulted, which kicked in about a half an hour after drinking it, were indeed more substantial than they had been with the previous experiment. This time around, an unmistakably dissociative buzz could be felt, vaguely comparable to Ketamine but much less interesting and not particularly enjoyable. No nausea was experienced this time around. ", "The high might perhaps best be described as having given the subject a sense that 'well, OK, there is something going on here, but its not particularly interesting and I can see no compelling reason to explore it further.' Upon lying down to sleep, the experience came as close as it ever was to achieving some redeeming recreative value. There subject found lying with eyes closed particularly relaxing, and rather enjoyed the slight dissociateive chaos that rambled on behind his closed eyes. All in all however, it just was not a very interesting experience. It wasn't physically or mentally trying or in any way uncomfortable; it simply did not provide the subject with any desire to explore the substance further; nor were there any indications that 'higher plateaus' might be particularly rewarding. The effects of this 'mid range' experience might easily have been anticipated from the effects of the first 'threshold level' experiment. ", "     In conclusion, I suspect that those with limited experience with true psychedelics and dissociatives might find DXM a nice, easily obtained legal high, but I can't imagine anyone with access to anything better ever seeking it out. It can be best described as a marginally  dissociative sedative. All in all, I think beer is more interesting than DXM.", "I am writing this two days after my first experience with DXM.  Monday i went to work as usual.  The school nurse called and my little boy was sick so i went to get him and some medicine at the store.  Well i been researching the DXM trip and had an afternoon to spare so i decided to go for it.  I bought the cough syrup and after my son was tucked in, i downed the 4 oz bottle (around 1pm) and waited for something to happen. 2Pm nothing happening yet so i smoked a joint.  3Pm came and i definately felt something.  I felt like a fucking robot.  I was freaking out because i could tell i was tripping (my pupils were very dialated.)  ", "My son woke up by now and he just thought i was sick like him.  At this point i really did wish i was sick and not tripping like this.  I go to the restroom.  At this point i am now peaking.  Thinking if i throw up i will get it out of my system i proceed to stick my fingers down my throat.  No luck.  I have to pick up my husband by six so i figured maybe i could sleep it off until then.  No luck.  I tossed and turned.  No visuals or anything crazy i just felt like i was loosing my soul and turning into a robot.  This continued until the next morning.  I awoke and went to the restroom.  I am still walking like a robot and feel not like me.  At this point i am just ready for it to fucking end. Realizing i cannot go to work in this state i call in sick.  First part of the day i sleep deep until about noon.  Still feel the same.  By now i am beginning to wonder if i will ever return to my normal state.  ", "Well that day passed also and now it is wednesday.  I came to work today but i still do not feel like myself yet.  That shit was very scary.  I have done alot of drugs in my life but none that made me feel like that.  I will never to that again. Simply as that.", "After reading the text contained here, I decided that a trip would be in order.  Having waltzed many a time with shrooms and acid, a little DXM had an adventerous ring to it.  ", "I went to my local drug store and looked for the drixoral capsules, of which there were none, so I purchased the recommended maximum strength formula and quickly got home to measure out my dose.", "I settled with a 6 in the 2nd plateau.  It seemed proper to get my feet wet and not go plunging into an abyss that I could not get myself out of.  I consumed the dosage at 6:20 in the evening and the effects had cleared pretty much by 12:15, a nice 6 hour dance with the devil.", "The onset came with the swiftness of a jaguar.  Slow but steady, it crept into my consciousness.  The first noticeable effects were the doubling of my vision.  Everything was in doubles and I had this drunken feeling.  It was then that I knew something grand was to happen, and being that I live alone, I decided to employ a sitter, just for gee whiz.", "I venture on a 10 minute drive that was at the very least interesting.  Complete concentration was needed for this drive.  No mistake was going to be tolerated, not by me and certainly not by the already nervous locals.  A quick hop skip and a jump and I arrived at a friends house that I had not seen in close to a year.  He was married now and the presence of his wife was a bit unnerving.  But she retired to the bedroom and we went for a walk.  At this point the double vision had not decreased (as it would become the trademark of this experience) but the feelings had intensified.  All around me objects were making a bold stand. Not moving or changing, but standing out as if to declare its foot in this new reality.  Another noticeable thing was a bit of jumpiness.  Sound seemed to leap out of nowhere and I was quick to turn my head to seek the source.  It was usually just my friend talking or a car driving by, but the sound never seemed to originate from where it actually came from.", "At this point my sitter had a joint, so we drove back to my apartment to use the bong.  It was at this point that the effect began to really intensify.  I had no idea of the time.  Time had ceased to exist and since I don't wear a watch it was all the more timeless.  For any activity I tried on this stuff, it required my full attention.  Once we got into the apartment, I felt this need to have my TV, radio, and air conditioner on.  Except that when I went to do each one of these things, I got turned around.  Any turn blurred the world and once I stayed still, the world had to situate itself.  So we smoked the bong and began a little dialogue. ", "The conversation began with me explaining what I took, how I configured the dosage, and how I found out about it.  The next thing I know (and to this day I don't remember how we got to the topic) we were engrossed in a conversation about eternity.  One odd thing (amongst others) was that my sitter wasn't on anything, but it seemed as if he was.  With shrooms or acid, one usually doesn't like to be around others who aren't experiencing a trip, it makes you feel, I don't know, apprehensive, but not with DXM.  We were able to carry a wonderful conversation on the human mind and the grappling of the concept of eternity.  And how space was so large that it would eventually come back on itself, but this was still eternity.", "Being that the man was married, he had to be back at 10, so the conversation must have been around 9ish.  He didn't bring his car, so I had to drive him.  Only problem was I couldn't drive at this point.  Everything was a task save for conversation.  Most objects had my attention, and then just as quickly, I was on to something else.  Concentration on one task was very difficult.  We went to another friends house to have him drive me back from the sitters.  Needless to say I shouldn't have been driving, but I am too mobile for my own good.", "I would day I got back to my apartment around 11-ish and sat down on my couch.  I was exhausted, all the running around had drained me completely.  So I put on some Coltrane and begun to draw.  I told myself that I would draw or write what ever came into my mind first.  I wrote, and looked down at the paper.  Before, in very chicken scratched handwriting was the phrase, 'Are you what you expected.  Well R you?'  Why this was on the paper, I don't know, what it means, I can guess, but I just posed the question to myself and sat in subtle contemplation for about another hour.  ", "At 12 I went to bed, but did not sleep.  I was in complete darkness and remembered something someone wrote about visuals in darkness, so I concentrated and the head board of my bed began to sway back and forth. This was amusing, but not alarming.  Hallucinations don't scare me, it is when you can't distern a hallucination from what is really going on that my nerves are up.", "My friends came by at 12:35 and I told them about what I had done and the curiosity was peaked.  I spent the next 7 hours watching over them as they tripped and at 6:00am, I went to work. But those events are of a completely differant nature.  I had my experience.  ", "In closing, if you are seasoned, or a first timer, this is a good thing to try.  I recommend a 2nd plateau for first timers and for veterans, savor the 3rd for special occasions.", "When I first met the guy they called Robo, I had no idea that you could trip on this stuff.  I was just an alcoholic, with occasional acid use & only one bad expirience with shrooms.  I thought he was crazy at first but, low & behold came the night I had no alcohol or cash.  He offered me a bottle if I would drive him to the store.  After that I was hooked.  After the first week he cut me off & made me steal my own bottles.  We were downing up to 2 family size bottles in 24 hr periods.  Frequently stealing bottles from each other while we were 'out'.  Friends called us Sid & Nancy....'You did my shit, & didn't save me any!!'", "So we come to the time about 3 months after my first try.  A bunch of punks were crashing at my house (Void & Upchuck & others).  I had downed at least 2 family size bottles & probably a little more stolen from Robo.  Laying on the floor, first my skin was on fire.  Made only more irritated by the red light in my room.  Lori, my trip sitter had to give me a cold bath to satisfactorly put out the flames.  Then back to laying on the floor.  My eyes were open, yet I couldn't see the room I was 'physically' in.  All I could see were these Victorian era people dancing in this huge ballroom.  I kept saying 'Help Me! Help Me!'  Lori talked to me so I knew she was there, even though I couldn't see her.  Also she kept touching me by my insistance.

Gone, sinking into the floor, I'm melting!  White chalk on blackboard I keep seeing, what's with this Hawaiian Luaiuia? or whatever something is pushing up daisies.

Its got to be up there with heroin.  It taste nasty, but once you get here; you never want to leave.  As it wears, I want more.  Robotussin is the Anti-Christ.  It makes me want death, makes it look pretty.  Disguised as cough syrup, satan is taking over America.  When I was in Florida, I wanted it for my 'family'.  Sort of Purgatory, Lori, Nick, me & Chris to exist forever on Robotussin in that rooom with blankets on the floor.  This is the first time I've ever went 100% alone into it.

Existing only spiritually?", "Well the night started off on a bad note, I found out that I was going to a rehab centre where i lived, to get some help, I had been doing a wide variety of drugs for about 3 years. After hearing the news of my future I decided to go for a walk. While walikng around I decided to go to the local drug store and get some sucrets (I had done dxm only a few times before). I bought two packs for only $3.29 each(it was all they had left) ", "I finally found myself at home again, and I waited until about 11 pm to talk all 36 sucrets. I didn't mind them one bit, tasted much better than any cough syrup. After about an hour I started feel a little buzz, then anohter hour later, it wasin full gear. Everytime I moved my head, I would feel sick (like motion sickness) I tried to listen to some music but that only made it worse. I could feel the sound waves hitting my brain, moving it in every direction. ", "I went outside for some fresh air and I had a smoke out there. I closed my eyes hopefully to see some cev's but nothing came. When I opened my eyes back up, it seemed everything was rushing away from my. The house, the street light, even someone walking down the street. This made me feel sick, so I ran to the bathroom and proceeded to puke out some of the drugs, I puked two more times that night. The buzz never went away until the morning. I felt no side effects at all the next day.  Also everytime I had a smoke I would puke, strange coincidence?...", "I've taken Robitussin a few times (well, at least generic eqivalents with the same quantity of active ingredients) and frankly, I don't get it. The first time all I did was catch a few trails from a cigarette after drinking about 4 oz. I heard some interesting noises, and procede to get really ill. I mean, I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital because I felt like my stomach and intestines were on fire. My friends thought that was strange and we figured I probably had the flu or something. So I tried it again, this time drinking eight ounces and I felt even worse. The trip was definitely not worth the intense physical pain I felt for 36 hours afterwards. I'm not sure if this is a common thing or not, or if I'm just some freak with a sensitive stomach.

So the next time after consulting with some fellow trippers I upped it to 450mg. Let me just tell you what happened next was like the scariest thing ever, at first I was really feeling great. But it kept getting progressively worse, and it got to the point where I could not walk, I was having a lot of trouble breathing and I was feeling like I was having a heart attack. I also was vomiting a lot. I was itchy like mad. and I slept on the bathroom floor because I couldn't get to my bed. Thank god my friend was there to hold me and help me. My question is... has anyone ever heard of/experienced a similar reaction? I weigh 120 lbs so that 450mg should not be too much, should it? Could it have been an allergic reaction or something.

Because I didn't want to get carried away I decided to try 2 oz and see what that did first. Well my first, and only, time trying that stuff was horrible. I ended up throwing up about 3 times on Saturday night. I also became very hyper and several times had problems breathing. Guess my system just doesn't like the stuff ay guys? Other symptoms included getting a fever and dizziness. This experience really scared the hell out of me. I think I'll just stick with the old methods from now on.

This time however...", "At around 11 PM (after feeling absolutely sick) I started to feel light-headed and heavy at the same time (last time was the same way). I then started feeling really happy and woozly (word I made up for when my body feels like its splitting in a good way). Me and my friend turned off all the normal lights and turned on a blacklight. We then put on Pink Floyd's WISH YOU WERE HERE album. I must say, it did feel good having the music flow through me. ", "After that we put on Alice In Wonderland. My friend was loving it, but I (even having seen the movie over 100 times) couldn't understand it. That's when everything went to hell...", "At around 3 I stood up, only to find that I couldn't stand up right. My friend asked if I was OK, but the black light and my screwed vision made his face look really scary. I asked him not to look at me for the rest of the night and he said OK. He then went to sleep (he can sleep on DXM although most people, including me, can't)", "I laid in my bed, all lights out. I felt very itchy and my heart sped up.

When it came back, my body seemed to die. I could move it, but couldn't feel it moving, which wasn't too bad, except it still itched so I couldn't scratch, and my vision was going crazy and...", "It wore off a little before 6 AM. It lasted really long. At 12 the next day (after 3 hours of sleep), I got called into work. My stomach hurt so bad and I felt so hung over, that I had to leave 5 hours early. I went home, and laid in my bed in agony with the worst stomach ache I've ever had.", "If your going to do DXM do little doses. Although 750 isn't a lot, it scared the shit outta me. I will never ever do DXM again. It is not the legal good trip, it's the legal MINDFUCK OF ALL TIME!", "I bought two 118 mL bottles of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough.  Each bottle contained 354 mg of DXM.  Came home.  Cleaned up me and the room. I was preparing for a spiritual trip.  i had meditated and all.  I downed both bottles for a total of 708mg of DXM.  I popped the 'Two Pages' cd into the player, laid back and relaxed. I was expecting a spiritual psychedelic trip. It was far from that.  .  90 minutes after ingestion i had the feeling nearly identical to snorting a few lines of ketamine.  The experience lasted a good 8 hours.  ", "I began spinning records, Olatunji, The Last Poets, Donny Hathaway, then i tried some classic drum n bass, then house. but i found it to be annoying to do any type of movement, as with K.  The effects were strong, and i couldnt have driven or gone about my business.  So i chose to lay back in darkness and let my mind run free.  The mind trip, on a scale of 1 to 10 was a 3.  it wasnt very crisp or clear and there was little insight, just a restatement of the known. I wont use DXM again as I didnt enjoy the experience.  It was just a serious waste of time in my opinion.  In my opinion DXM is slightly psychedelic and mostly dissociative.  It's similar to K but lasts for hours.", "I use DXM quite a lot. I've been using it off and on for about two years, usually in ~400mg doses once or twice a week with ~800mg doses every now and then. I've gotten pretty hooked on several occations, doing it on a daily basis until I realize it's time to get a grip and lay off for a few months. The point here is I have a good bit of experience with the substance and it's effects on me.", "I use plain Robotussin(tm) some of the time, but since I have a fairly regular habit, I often use pure powder since it's cheaper and more pleasant to take. I most usually stuff it in capsules. Although I have no scale, comparing the effects of premeasured robo and my caps, I have a vauge idea of how much powder is how much. It seems the caps I usually fill contain ~400-500mg, since they are a little stronger then a 4oz of robo.", "I've been toying with the idea of snorting DXM instead of swallowing it for some time. I figured it may speed up the onset (I usually see 1 hour delay with robo, 1 1/2 hour with caps. Remember, this is me. It may be vastly diffrent for you and your body), and perhaps get more milage out of the powder. I checked the net and found very little. The only actual experience I found was here at erowid and that person sounded a little inexperienced. Also, he did ~400mg, which IMO sounds like and awful lot since insufflating generally deliver quite a bit more into the bloodstream then swallowing.", "Finding nothing, curiosity got the better of me. One day, after having taken 400mg approximatly 6 hours previously, the mild trip was fading, nearly gone altogether. I scooped out what I approximate to be 100mg of powder, about the volume of 8 match heads or so. I snorted it through a rolled up piece of paper. It burned a bit, but not bad at all. The burning lasted about five minutes. I felt some sort of effect after 5 sec or so, my head seemed to 'open up', kind of like I'd taken a hit off an ephedrine inhaler. I never really felt much effect beyond that, but otoh I did still have some DXM in my system to begin with.", "Encouraged by the mild stinging (I was expecting a lot more), I decided to not do DXM at all for a while and try it again with a clear head. After two days, I decided it was time. I got out my powder again and layed up two piles, ~100 each. I had taken a 25mg ephedrine tab about an hour or two before, which may have affected the state of my nasal membranes. I did both piles, one in each nostril. This time it stung pretty bad, not unbearably bad, but bad. After a few minues, the stinging got worse. And worse. And worse. I started tearing up, taking deap long breaths in through my nose and out through my mouth, which helped a tiny little bit. After about ten minutes, I could feel the effects comming on a little, but my sinuses were still stinging too bad to really notice. I sucked some water up through my nose, attempting to dull the pain. Nothing really worked very well. This was majorly bad. I ripped through my medicine cabinet and found some saline solution and squirted puff after puff into my tortured sinuses. It helped a little, the pain started fading a little as I gagged on the salty water running down the back of my throat. A full 30 minutes after I did the deed, the pain was nearly gone. I felt very sore and did so for a good hour and a half. I kept fealing slightly sore throughout the rest of the day. At the half hour mark when the pain went down enough to actually tell, I felt about as if I'd taken ~400mg orally. In other words, this venture saved me around 200mg of powder and perhaps an hour of activation time.", "I would recommend this to my worst enemy, but no one else. If you want to try, my suggestion would simply be DON'T. If you do, I can almost guarante that you will not try it again.

I ran to the bathroom and let it out. It was very hard to vomit, my insides were too relaxed to do any of the work. I managed to get it up, but I didnt feel any better afterwards. I got the wacky cam really really bad. My friends were talking to me and looking at them was a challenge, it seemed as if they were moving around, even though they were standing still. I honestly thought that I was going to die. I was so disconncted from my body. Time was extremely dilated, and lost, too. I found myself in my friends room, yet I dont know how I got there and he would have told me if I had passed out, but I did not.

On the part of the rug in front of the television that used to be cluttered with clothes, video game controllers, and papers was now replaced with a large group of san pedro and peruvian torch cacti in big clay pots. I was stunned by the fact that it was so full blown and life like. I had to vomit again and it was so damn hard getting it up. I can't remember how much time later it was, but I saw another weird thing. There was an empty fan box in the hall, and further down the hall was a laundry basket resting on a cabinet, (they were really there) but when I stared at them, it formed into a man, looking at himself in a mirror. This scared me because his face was all twisted out of shape, I thought it was death coming to take me away. ", "About an hour and a half later, I woke up from the dream state with no more nausea,  and I am very intoxicated. I can barely walk, and my speech is incoherent, yet I am able to deal with it. The affects slowly recede, and I am finally able to fall asleep. The next day, my trip sitter told me that he really thought that I was going to die. We are both glad that I am still here. It is obvious that I am allergic to this drug, and that I hit plateau sigma, or close to it. I am thankful to be alive. Never again.", "I always wanted to know what an acid trip was like, and I heard that you can get the same effects with DM cough syrup, so I went to the drug store and picked up a 4 oz (120 mL) bottle of extra strength DM 'tussin' cough syrup.

I was talkative and I seemed to notice colors and lights a little more than usual. These mild effects lasted about 5 hours before I felt like it was totally worn off. ", "The next day, I got a little bolder. I downed the remaining portion of the bottle. This amounted to 240 mg (80 mL or 16 teaspoons or 2/3 of the bottle). I ate some food both times, so this may have delayed the start of the effects. Perhaps there was a little bit left in my system from the day before. ", "I was sitting down, doing some reading, and nothing happened for well over an hour or maybe two hours. Then, all of the sudden, I got a severe heat flash. It felt like a sick wave flowing over my entire body. I could even feel a strong buzzing (almost like pain) in the roots of my teeth. Every inch of skin on my body felt like it was next to a hot water bottle. I was very light headed and thought I was going to die. I quickly scribbled information on a piece of paper to tell anyone that found me what I had taken. The heat flash went away after what seemed like 5 or 10 minutes. Actually it was probably only a minute or two. I felt my forehead and it was dripping with sweat.", "I was ok for a while after that. I talked with a friend for about 10 or 15 minutes, but it seemed like hours. Again, I was very talkative. I felt like I was making sense, and having an enjoyable time. I just felt spacy. There were no visual hallucinations, but things did look a bit foggy.", "After my friend left I got several more heat flashes. They seemed to be getting closer together. Each time, I thought I was going to die or at least pass out. Each time it happened, I just kept telling myself, 'I'm going go get throught this.' over and over. VERY unpleasant! ", "I walked around a little bit. My head seemed to be bobbing up and down like you feel while sitting in a small boat on the waves. Things were a little distorted. I felt like a midget walking down the hall. I had some difficulty talking coherently. My eyes started to burn, and my mouth became excessively dry. I couldn't concentrate on anything for more than a few seconds. I tried to focus on reality so I wouldn't loose control. I used to use MJ so I was able to keep from panicing, but it is still a scary to face the unknown.", "As the frequency of the heat flashes increased, I began to wonder if the DM was still getting into my system, and making things worse. I had serious doubts about whether or not I could get myself home in this condition. I determined that if things got any worse, that I might die, so I picked up a phone book and started looking for emergency numbers. I remember being totally frustrated because I knew I wanted to find a number to call to get help, but all I could do was flip the pages. I couldn't figure out exactly what to look up. Finally, I looked inside the front cover. 911 seemed a little drastic. The only other number was poison control. After several attempts, I finally dialed the number successfully. The problem was that I couldn't remember which digit I had just dialed or which one to dial next. I was quite incoherent on the phone, and had a lot of difficulty giving my address, phone number, etc. The lady told me that I had taken quite a lot, and that I should have someone take me to a hospital. I asked what might happen to me if I didn't go, and she said that I possibly could go into a coma and/or stop breathing. This scared me enought that I decided I needed to go in.", "I found a friend that was willing to take me in. Thank goodness for friends. In the Emergency Room, I experienced several more heat flashes. My heart rate was up to almost 120 beats per minute when I was at my calmest point. They pumped my stomach and put activated charcoal down me to absorb any remaining DM. That is an experience well worth avoiding! I even preferred the blood and urine tests to the gastric lavage. My nose and throat were quite sore for several days afterward. I started coming down in less that an hour after these treatments. The doctor told me that the dose wasn't fatal, but if I hadn't come in, I might have passed out, and probably would have continued to experience the symptoms for at least another 8 hours. It would have been a real trick to explain that one to my family. It was hard enough to explain as it was. DM seems to be much more toxic than I had anticipated.", "As I came down, my vision cleared up. I realized that the emergency sprinkler system in the ceiling was actually covered with dust. When I first got in there, it looked like it was covered with some crystaline jelly; I didn't even know it was a mild hallucination at the time. So, what good is a hallucination if you don't know it's a hallucination? I wonder what else I hallucinated.", "They let me go within about 4 hours after I was admitted to E.R. At that point, I had a significant head ache, like a heavy hangover. My nose ached deep inside where they had put the tube in. I think it took several more hours for my heart rate to go back to normal. There was also a jittery twitchy feeling in the back of my leggs. I didn't sleep well that night. The hangover feeling lasted for another day. Three days later, I took half of an imipramine (a prescription antidepressant left over from a legitimate prescription) because my head felt a little foggy. A few hours later, I got a miniature heat flash, and felt a little spacey. That never happened before when I was on these antidepressants.", "All in all, I think it was a VERY bad experience! Sure there were a few weird effects, but the negatives far outweighed the positives. The dose I took was significantly lower than what some people claim to have taken. I'm just glad I didn't chug the whole bottle at once. Perhaps some people's bodies can handle DM better than mine, but I have also noticed a large increase in people telling about bad experiences with it.", "I don't think it's a very good idea to take a chance with DM. But, if you do, please start with lower doses, let a few days pass between doses, and increase the doses gradually. Not like me where I took twice as much as the time before. As for me, I don't think I will ever take DM again! As for you, try something safer, or at least be very carefull! BTW, I now hear that the tussin high is quite a bit different than being high on LSD, so I guess I still don't know what acid is like.", "This is for some of you who may or may not be interested in what happened to me last saturday night just before, during, and after ingesting 1020 mg of DXM. Note that it's writting in a slightly bizarre John Lennon-esque style and may be hard to follow. I wrote it for a few of my friends, so there a just a few references that you won't understand. Here goes:", "Hello friends. Yesterday I was feeling a touch lethargic. I had woken up only around 2 pm and generally felt like a lazy bum. I messed around for a while on the computer, reading email and news. Well not really a while because I emerged from a semi-comatose state at around 6 pm. I decided shutting the computer off would be the wise thing to do at that point so that is what happened.", "Grabbing a bite or 10 from the cafeteria, I pondered the slogan of Jester cafeteria: 'What you Don't Know Can't Hurt You.' I didn't know what I was eating but so it didn't hurt me unless you count starch overload and gaseous pain as bad, which I don't. Upon returning to my room I arrived. The roommate of mine, Mr. James was entirely present at once giving studying a go of it.", "'James, I lamented,' I said at the time, 'Studying on a saturday night?'", "'Yeh,' he said. Noting that he did not say 'Yeah' but more of a 'Yeh' with a long uuuh sound. I seated myself on the seat infrontwise of the computer and flicky the switch that turney it on. Reading news and mail for even more longer periods of time I morosed at my situation again. Spotting the presence of many drixoral cough caps in my desk drawer I suddenly developed a rather severe cough requiring immedietly medical attendonitis.", "Writing myself a perspiration is wont to help being the situation as it pleased me so, I consumfed the pills regularly quick. Putting clothes on (nekkid was I this whole time) rendered me fully clothed and I discovered that my ears were detecting strains of bizarre religious Korean music wafting from a box adorning Mr. James' desk. 'Thinking this won't do,' I said quietly determined to find my own tunes. I put on the headphones and started to play the Musak of all. Quickly finding the bright light unappealing, and noticing I was on the higher floor of the dorm, I elected to faraway to a more pastoral clime.", "Gathering my belongs into a green bag that materialized in my paws, I forgot to include a wonderfully handy Mini-Mag lite that would have solved woeful problems I encountered later in the evening. Note the clever use of foreshadowing in the previous passage. I included amongst these materials a Walk-man and tapes of various important American rock-and-roll bands the devil's music as it were. Also was cigarettes and the important useful lighter, black in color. I considered flooding my guitar into my pocket and percolating that too, but the accoustics were suffering as a result of the stuffage so I left saying, 'Good-bye, Mr. James! I will see you later.'", "Shaky swagger down the hall stopping to release bladderfuls of concerns into porcelain. My heart was heavy and my eyes were dim as I realized it was almost 45 minutes since ingesting the ahem medicine and the effectingness were starting to notice upon me. I stepped outside into the lovely cool air noting the temperature was neither hot nor cold. It seemed to me to be like one of the oft-remembered nights-on-the-town of Incline yore.", "I stooped beneath an old oak tree adorning the lawn at the corner of East 21st Street, Austin Texas 78705-9005 postal code and the nearby adjacent San Jacinto street. I smoked a filthy cancer stick noting that the taste was unusually pleasantly remindful of smoking past with the combination of the evil grass leaf, cannabis sativa. You see, I usually smoked Camel Special Lights (TM) (R) along with the bad mary jee-wana and the taste is remindful as I was smoking the selfsame ciggies last night. The music was continually playing note after note in my left and right ear, being the Dead (who are ironically alive) playing a lovely China Cat Sunflower -> I Know You Rider which is lovely. The notes started to close my eyes and I rode along the golden crest of waves.", "Simply sitting under the tree was the time first of all that I realized that the miniature Mag-lite would have been useful to sort my assortment of un-sorted musical tapes. As it was dark. I decided to move myself closer to the light-source illuminating and perched high humpty-dumpty style on a wall of sorts nearto and overlooking the street aforementioned. Many people passed nearby (but never touching) as this was a busy sort of street near many dorms including the one in which I lived. I looked at the popel but touching was not done. Bored getting was I though I had only barely begin to tripppp out.", "In the U of T, A there is a feature architechtually or landscaping-known in some circles considered to be a South Mall to which I decided to rest my bones. In front of the largest Penis in the Sated of Texas is a large Lawn named the South Mall. At the North End of the South Lawn is a statuesque of Jefferson who is also holding a dildo in his left hand (this is true.) Across the lawn is clearly visible the State Capitol of Texas forming a large line across the city of Austin, Tekas.", "Walking wise the mile or less to this site seemed to take a longishly short amount of time as my feet moved very very fast it seemed. I knew at this point that the effects of my uh cough medication were takingly effects. I found the South Mall where I left it from Last Time which was friday. I walked across the ocean of green (though sort of blue in the flourescent and moonlight) grass to the exact center of the lawn. I was now part of the line betweenwixt the afro mentioned objects. Laying on the underside of of my back I noticed the milky way gladcy was lining up to me too.", "My rain falls like crazy fingers. I straighting out my possesions including the hat atop my head blocking my access to the ground. If not for hair, we would all be bald so be thankful. Many times when you are thinking about the Earthy you picture your place being that one of a flat area plane. Rarely is it an enticing thought to actually see yourself in a round sphere at the apex. Well my friends at this point in the Tale I will draw a diagram:", "/^ oooooo (ooooooooo) /ooooooooooo (ooooooooooooo)>-|o <- [Fig. 2: 'Me'] * ooooooooooo/ | (ooooooooo) [Fig. 3: 'Nearest Star'] ooooooo ,/", "In other words I was sitting at the very nearest point of the Earth to the point in space I was looking straight up at. Believe me it took a long time to draw that stupid Earth Fig 1. I don't even know what figs have to do with it.", "I thought of Sumner also at that instant, though I am not sure what connection he has here at this time. I flippeded the tape over and listening to 'Loser' no not the recent Dylan-esque pop-bubblegum classique recorded by the late Beck but the old Dead song. I am telling you now (in just a second) that the guitar solo was more than I had heard. Wow. Well I just told you. I flipped the tape over and started hearing the following song that I heard, which was 'Good Lovin' and I got some. Following that was the Drums solo and that was wild so I was just a grovin' to everything. I lit up another ciggie and noticed the taste was even more loveler and before. I beheld that I only had a few left so I had best conserve them lest I run out before the night was through. 'So this will be the last one for a while' was my line of thought here.", "Now here comes the crux of the story, or the je ne sais quai or the climax if you are sexually obsessed: I don't know what I did with the lighter. I mayhaps have tossed it aside into the yon fields of grass or stuffed it into a nook and or a cranny or put it aside, but the being point I was making is that it's GONE. No light no smoke. I realize this as Drumz goes back into Good Lovin. Finally the words start again, and aghast I say out loud to myself, 'This was all one song?! I thought it was, well,' more songs, I said. I lookie at all the peeplies walking aboust on a proustly Saturday night. Many of them are perhaps wondering to themselves as, 'Who is this guy on the grass anywhays,' or 'Damn, my last joint,' or perhaps as, 'I wonder if that guy on the grass has a really bad cough or something?' But the answer was for none to see.", "Rather surprising at once point was when a guy walking merrily about his way down the bath suddenly stooped and did a cartwheel. As this person was now spinning about a purple axis, I wondered, 'Did my eyes just decieve me or did that person suddenist spin around a pooply axis, bold as love?' Such recriminations were nost in order though as I heard 'Dancing in the Streets' and 'Morning Dew' in the next order. I had by now rolled around considerably on the grass and perplexing the poor stuff. It felt rather soft and nice to my trippy hands. Finally I took out my Dead 5/2/70 tape and put in the Beetles 'own 'Blue Album' collection of song materials.", "Listening to 'Strawberry Fields Forever' as I surveyed the surrounding architecture I noted a large Church religious shire near. Thinking the origional Strawberry Fields was religious related in Liverpudlian, I floated up and down the lawn lamenting the lack of personages familiar to me. Penny Lane was in my ears and in my eyes, beneath the dark star filled sky. I did discover the missingosity of my beloved lighter used to create fire. I spent quite a long unfortunate time seaching for this piece of machinery. It was becoming the focal point of my existance. As all of the people currently reading this epic toem have been under the influenced of the evil mary Juanta plant can attest to this feces: LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WHEN STONED IS BAD NEWS. Everythingly seems to take forever whike you wonder, 'Did I look here before?' I searched my green bag which was laying leisurely near me. I searched my pockets and my jacket and the ground near me, but the lighter had mysteriously vanished into the nether-lighter realm. Eventually drugging the passages of 'A Day In The Life' I gave up my quest (temporaly) and gathered my remaining belongings up and walked to the North.", "Wondering abits with nothing to do, I feeled the need to urinate again (After all I had drank quite a bit of liquids in revealing the drixorals to my stomach) so headed to the nearest Building. Which happened to be the Undergrad Library, which happened to be closed. I proceeded to the NEXT building, which was the infamous Student Union upon entering. Mostly it was closed as well but some areas of the large structurly were open for business of any ports. Finding it very berry difficult to walk at this time, I turned off my headphones. It seems that the bassline of 'All You Need Is Love' was effecting the movements of my feet in such a way that made walking impossible. The walls were beginning to melt and Greg Brady was emerging from the woodwork in a way that I Wish he wouldn't. Feeling OK Soda for the moment though, I thought about Where I found a Bathroom on my Summer Vacation. Near the bowling alley.", "Bowling Alley?! No bowling alley in a Student Union, were there? Sure enough there was and it was quite packed with younders enjoying all sorts of sports infolving throwing heavy balls at white pins. Luckily for me the balls of all sorts were evading my head and extremities, but Not for Long! I wondered how could that last after all I Was standing in the 'alley' as they termed it for throwing the balls at the pins. 'Cries of,' hey what's that moron thinks he's doing, and Get out of the way, dummy! 'Accompanied my fusilade.' Jimping merrily dodging heavy black spheres, I foundst my way to the pretty potty. Ah, relief I shouted as the stream of pee-pee failed to erupt. 'Oh yeah,' I thought, 'I gotta turn it on!' And so it were. I urinated most merrily.", "My lighter, I thought, is still missing. Perhaps I could find it by the light of my faithful dog Cragsemere. The sauana bathroom light provided the illumination neccesary to conduct another investigation into the whereabouts of the light but no further progross was made. A FREAK was in the bathroom with me. I gourd hardly see the poor man though as cough pills tend to alleviate that nasty vision thing, and he was melting and falling to bits as it were. Ruminating should I held the fellow get back together in one piece, no Fuck him! I shouted and ran out of the room (it was a bathroom.)", "Strugglying to find my way to the street I came across an endless field. It shimmered and shimmied for a moment and a bus stop filled the void. A bus came buy and I got on that's when it all began. There was a Cowboy named Neal at the wheel of the bus to never-ever land. Finally tombledown I reached the end of the Union and emerged blasphmeming into the street. Music resumed playing at this thyme, goo goo gaa joob was the ralleying cry.", "Surely my eyes aren't decieving me, but I swore this girlie that I knew from way back on the Island walks by and says, 'Hallo' as she is want to do. Me as I was fiddeling with stuff didn't realized it until after the time, Butt I said 'Hallo' anyway. Who knew? Maybe next year I will get a right hook too. Walking down Guadalouppe (the Drag) why a drag it was, too. I found myself in the West Mall this time, which is different from the South Mall in that it plays to the West rather than Southerly, and there is little to know grass here. Turn that damn guitar down! Well I float in liquid gardens and Arizona's new red sands. I sat to recoup and gain my senses and possibly replace the tape I am playing with.", "Sitting on the bench my eyes become rather bizarrely orientated. Have you seen the films of the science-fiction? It is somewhat approximately like that. A small roving portion of my eye becomes disctinctly focued and magnificationly wise. I use this new-found super power for the dardest of deeds, to look for that darnded lighter again. Instead my roving eye focuses in on a steady stream of ants coming this way! Now I hate ants dearly and I stand up to avoid them at all costs. Sure enough one clings to my hand which I shake off.", "Finding another place to stand, I realized that my music was not playing the correct notes! Often times the notes were slower than intended. So I replace the batteries (this is hard with 1 hand, 1 hook, and a 34 drixorals.) And select a new tape, one with a mix of many bands. That def dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball. By now I am surely an adjective descriped as 'PEAKING' and since I have lost my lighter I am near the point of crying tears. My vision is not so good as because things are dripping and rearranging right before my eyes, surely not an effect of a psychadelic drugs?", "I decide to make my way gently and slowly to my home-time abode. I wonder, 'What time is it?' so I check my watch to find out the answer to this lovely question. It seems the watch face has melted onto my wrist. It is therefore impossible to find out the time, but fortunately the U of T, A is equipped with an extra-large Penis as noted before. This Penis chimes out the hour every hour on the hour. I found it to be by now 12 midnightly by my reckoning. I found my way back to the South Mall and gave the damn grass a once-more going over to find my lighter. No luck so I lay down on the grass. My body quite literally melts into the earth, leaving the essence of my soul clinging to the ground like a vapor. However, perhaps the source of this disturbance can be found. You see I cannot verily go to French class on Monday if my body has melted into the Earth, can I now? The musak goes out of Space (for those of ye who don't know, a very bizarre sound-effects weird thing done at Dead shows) and into a song, 'The Other One.' The guitar notes emerging from Space into Other One is the life-force that slowly ebbs back into my body. It rises from the ground, engulfs my body, and I rise from the Dead so to speak.", "I was very pleased that my soul found a home again, because I had a paper due in English coming up and it's hard to type if your soul's body has melted into the ground. I decide now would be a good time to return sightly home again. I make my way back to the lovely Moore-Hill dorm (my home). Smoking (en francais, fumar) is verboten dans el Universitdo, so you have to smoke your dagga outside. I cleft a ciggie to my lips and learn again that I have no light. Damn! However, there is a studnut run radio station in the next building. some nasty hippie kids are standing by the door smoking, so I figure how can I get a light from them? Being near them would be a good start. I try to be near them but they have disappered. They are gone. I go back to my corner of the universe, and sure enough there they are again. I am afraid that I cannot speak, so I forget about the whole situation and smoke an unlit cig. Making my way inside and up to my room, I put the key in the lock and twist and turn for ages. Finally the door is agahst and Mr. James is standing lookin' perplexed. 'The door was open the whole time,' he scowls at me.", "'Oh. Still studying?' I ask nochalantly but I am given away. I was speaking a foul alien tounge and now HE KNOWS. 'Yeh.' But then he leaves so I am left alone. I run into the shower and cleanse myself. This is a difficult task while still frying fully. Several times I have to remind the water to behave itself. Eventually I am done and return to my room. I turn the light off and sit down on the bed.", "For the first time that night, I realize exactly what went on (that I was tripping, etc.) I think I have come down, but not completely. I turn on the music again and relax to the edifying tunes of music.

Around 3 months ago, i'd pursued research into usage of DXM, especially into one state of consciousness known on the DXM faq as 'Plateau Sigma'. This seemed to be a very delusional and unpleasant state, but I was adiment that I would pursue it, just to see if I (a self named, and externally named subgenius) could control my mind, psyche and consciousness whilst in this state.", "Here's how I dosed (note: i didn't follow the faq):", "T+00h: ingested 500mg white (foul tasting) powder in vodka (1 shot)", "waited awhile. after around 30min i felt first effects, at which time I took a gelcap containing 350mg more dxm. i took another dose later, but i'll get to that in a minute", "I sat on my sofa in my room, having the odd cigartette and playing with my guitar (btw,  this is very satisfying in conjunction with cannabis). at roughly the 3hr point, i snapped out of my guitar / cigarette trance, realising that i was struming away absolute bullcrap instead of trying to perfect 'riders on the storm'. fair enough. the world around me after this trance was so utterly alien it's really impossible to describe.", "Imagine this: i'm around 10 inches tall, with really long legs and the room around me is the size of what literally seems like the Sydney opera house. in front of me is a coffee table, which although was right in ront of me seemed quite far away. I had the sensation that there was now no wall or sofa behind me and that at any given moment i could fall into nothingness, so i had to constantly check. there was nothing outside this little world i was in at the moment, reality beyond the room seemed incomprehensible and all that was there was what i thought was infinity. space and time, and even life itself would disappear in a nanosecond were i to leave this room. thanatos at my door, and a black hole behind me, how comforting. then i realised that my thoughts were completely delusional, so i snapped out of it and looked around again. still the same, but this time i realised it was my room and i was safe there. ok.", "i'd prepared one final dose for myself on my bedside table, as another vodka shot (650mg DXM), and a paracetamol lying next to it (thoughts become more delusional as body temp rises) so down that went and i lay on my bed for a while. i sort of dozed off, & went to a world of mine which i keep in my mind for psychedelic trips. i was there, the place was vast & white, full of buildings, the floor a conveyor belt of geometric patterns and the sky a green entrance to the infinity. my quest this time was simply to explore as far as i could before awakening. i had the advantage over the world this time. my body needed no control and i had neither the inhibitions of emotion or pain.", "Turning the corner i encountered what i thought was the god-entity. this, i thought was the entity ruling absolutely over the different realities and as such had unquestionnable power over me, my life and everything, everywhere. darkness came and went, different realities passed - planets were brought to me and disappeared just as quickly, full of different ecosystems, different florae and faunae, culture and religion. just as i got a glimpse into a new and wonderful world, another would appear, equally as intriguing. i now had no body, no soul and no attributes to my name. i was powerless to go forward from this point and my only choice was to observe what was happening around me.", "My vision skipped and i was back to my bedroom. i looked at myself, then struggled to see the time on the clock. 1pm, four and a half hours since first ingestion. that meant, to my relief that I'd come back to what was my world, the world I was comfortable and familiar with. no, that was wrong. I looked out of my window. everything was different, the trees outside, the neighbourhood and people i saw were all monstrous. these realities i had seen were now combined, and no matter how i tried to bring myself back to reality, it stayed the same. oh crap. i broke down in tears, thinking the world would stay like that, and i'd be trapped with monsters, my emotions and my personality consumed by this god-entity. whereas i was a god of my own inner reality, this one was of far vaster knowlege, and in his eyes i was pathetic, so he took away what was me and replaced it with a dead, roaming soul.", "I went back to my bed, and just lay down, drifting in and out of consciousness, thinking ' will i drift like this forever? at least i'm peaceful this way, so i'll stay like this'.", "At some point i fell fully into sleep, having very weird dreams, and awoke around 12 hours later, feeling very dry, and very hungry, i just sat on my bed, lit a cigarette and thought about what happened. i felt so glad to be where i was, to be smoking this cig, to be myself once again and that my friends, family and girlfriend were all out there, not knowing this state. I'd been given a new lease of life and wasn't going to abuse it, and to this day i've felt better about the world around me, about myself, and about the people around me. i think it's about as close as i ever got to a near-death experience, and no other drug i've tried has had nearly as profound an effect on me as DXM. but there was a very good and justified reason that dr.

When we went down the antibiotics isle, *C* held up a bottle of Robatussin and pointed to the active ingredient (Ane one of the ONLY ones..) and *T* and I laughed furiously of course. :)  ", "Well we got back to *C*'s house and we poured our 'DXM' (hehe) bottles into a cup and we downed the horrid-tasting-cherry-flavored-childhood-nightmare-medicine.  *C* ended up vomiting about an hour later, and he said he was coming up.  *T* and I went inside and sat down to watch the Aphex Twin (Window Licker) Video - extremely funny... anyway; *T* exclaimed that his scalp itched 'like a m*th*r f*ck*r' and asked me to scratch it for him, as well as his back.  So I scratched his back and scalp to ease his already-going-bad-trip.  After I had scratched him for a while, I was watching TV and I noticed that I was itching too, I passed it off and ignored it, after a while it was completly un-ignorable.  I quickly ran into *C*'s bathroom and took off my shirt, and ran his sink as cold as the water would get, and I rubbed it all over myself, this soothed it untill I was dry again... most of the night I had bright red hands that were puffy and itchy as if I was russling through a bush of poison ivy.

I called up my friend and we decided to pick up a couple of bottles of robo and wander around campus trying to find something to do.  Now I should point out that before this night I had done DXM at the same dose 1x, at slightly less 3x, and at a higher dose in the form of coricidin pills (yes, the one time so far I was stupid enough to let peer pressure get the better of me) 1x, and had found it to be sometimes fun, very easy to get into a bad mood on if not careful, but other than that useless in the mind expansion area...  this night would change my mind.", "11:00pm - Drank the robo (the taste of which I find pleasant, btw) and walked to campus.  Most of the walk was uneventful and the DXM took an extremely long time to fully kick in.  By 2:00pm it had taken full effect, but neither of us was really up for doing anything else and it was getting late so we went our separate ways.  As usual I got past the night checker at the dorms while pretty decently fucked up with no incident and laid down in bed.  That's when the interesting stuff began.", "2:30-??:??am - I didn't have any time reference at this point but I would estimate that I was awake around 2 hours based on my tiredness the next day.  As I was laying there with my eyes closed, I began to start having thoughts that I knew were telltale signs of a bad robotrip.  I'm experienced enough to put a stop to these thoughts without distractions around, but this time I decided that there was some reason for it, and let it continue.", "Suddenly, I saw my recent life as a deck of cards, laid out on a table.  I say 'saw' but it was really more of a concept that could be viewed but not in the normal sense of the word.  I was able to take any of these cards I wanted from the table and view them.  Each card represented a single success or failure in my recent actions, as viewed by a third party, and complete understanding of why it was seen that way was accessed simply by looking at it.", "I was able to go through many of the cards and find out what I had *truly* been doing right or wrong in life and how I could do better.  It was a very strong and interesting experience that I did not expect, and it has helped me see where I am going wrong when sober since then.  It also changed my view of DXM:  I'm not going to do it around people anymore.  With nobody around to distract me from introspection, it becomes a very useful substance for learning about myself, and especially how others might view me which is something I normally have a very difficult time seeing.", "I dosed about 9-10 hrs the night before I had to take a drug test (DOH! What can I say? I was bored and just didn't think.) Probably hit the upper limits of the second plateau. Effects lasted a good portion of the night, and in fact I still felt 'something' on the train ride in the next AM. Drug test was an EMIT urine (aka Tox 5). I came back negative for all, including PCP and Opiates (WHEW!). I have since found that DXM will give a false PCP positive that can be verified as false.", "On a side note, I felt very detached from the world and my life that night, and calmly contemplated suicide and the effects and ramifications that would have on others in my life. I didn't feel sad or unhappy, in fact I didn't feel anything. I recall deciding that now was not the time, but that later in life I should do just that. I do not have a hx of depression or suicidal ideation, and the next day was very disturbed to think about how much of my trip had focused on me ending my life. There were no external stimuli that could have given me the idea (movies, music, etc.). I decided to stop using DXM more from this seeming threat to my life rather than the threat of a false positive drug test.", "I found out about 'robo-trippin' from a friend at school, I decided I had to do it. I  tried it, and I loved EVERY time, except my last.", "This was my last robotrip. I had done it 7 times before (every weekend for the past 7 weeks) and it was always great. One night, I was heading to a party and I picked myself up a bottle of Robo. At around 7:00 I drank the bottle. About 30 mins later I started to feel the standard body buzz/drunkedness. I was really excited for some reason, and it made the buzz more intense.", "At around 10:00 I went to the party and I still wasn't tripping very hard. No visuals, drunkedness was wearing off, etc. When I got to the party I was feeling a little sick to my stomach. (normal occurance), but when I went inside, people freaked out. They were staring at me and asking if I was ok. Someone said 'you're pale as a ghost, I've never seen anyone so pale!' At this point I got a little worried and the slight sickness had gone from irritation to extreme pain. I was holding my stomach and wandering around in pain.", "Everything at the party started to get hazy, I couldn't stand and listen to anyone talk, or stay in one place at all for that matter. I guess I showed up to the party a little late, because there was a small fight earlier, which casued people to go home and the party to end shortly after. So I decided to leave also. On my way out to my brothers car, I got really nausous and stopped to vomit on a tree. I swear I puked up my last three meals! Less then 30 mins after ariving I went home and crashed into my bed to sleep this trip off. ", "I quickly realized I couldn't go to sleep and I stayed in the bathroom trying to vomit up the rest of the robo to stop the pain. I couldn't vomit so I tried to go to sleep again.", "At this point I starting tripping...HARD. I was lying in my bed and it felt like I was floating around on top of my sheets, and levitating slightly off my bed. Everything had a strange but inviting glow to it. My room looked very strange, and although I knew where I was, I felt like I was in a different world. I started to doze off into a dream-trip, where I was still awake, with my eyes closed and I was DREAMING (about what I cannot recall). It was very intense, but my connection to this 'dream world' wasn't very good, I kept waking back up and dozing off. I could close my eyes and still see everything in my room. I know I have got more intense visuals off LSD and mushrooms, but these were, without a doubt the strangest visuals ever. At this point I was enjoying my trip very much. And I had all but forgotten about the Pain.", "Then it came back like a train, pain was slamming my stomach so hard I thought something had burst inside me. I shot out of my bed and headed for the bathroom. I leaned over the toilet trying to puke, but again I couldn't. After about 20 mins the pain had subsided and I stood up, looking into the mirror. I was very scary looking, my face and chest were as white as paper and my eyes were bloodshot. I stumbled back to my room and layed back down. ", "After 5-10 mins the dream-trip started coming back. It was the same as my last dream stage. Then the pain came back, and I once again ran to the bathroom. This time, for some odd reason I forced myself to puke, and all that came out was gross chunks with BLOOD! I was scared out of my mind, I thought I was vomiting up my organs. But to my surprise, besides the intense fear, I felt much better. I got up again and looked into the mirror, this time I looked much better, and the fear sort of faded off.", "I figured it was all over, and I went back to my room and layed down, hoping to fall sleep this time. The dream-state started again, but this time the visuals where less intense, as were the 'other-world' feelings. ", "The pain came back three more times before I finally fell alseep. I didn't vomit again, and I no longer entered the dream-like state once the pain had died down for another short period.", "I layed in bed between the episodes of pain and wondered what I had done to myself. I thought I would have to go to the hospital in the morning and get myself checked out. When I woke up I felt fine, there were no after effects and all my color hard returned to my face. To this day I still can't figure out what made me so sick, as this was my regular dosage.", "To wrap-up this experience I would like to say a few things. First off, I was not on any medications at the time. Secondly, I did not do any other drugs that night, only DXM. The last thing I would like to point out is that I had done DXM in the exact same dosage and even higher every time I had done it before, but this was by far my most intense and painfull trip. Sy my final thought would be, even if you've done it before, DXM can sneak up on you and bring you for a painfull ride. I thought I knew what I could handle, and I was wrong.", "Wow I dont really know if you could call that tripping but whatever. I was sitting around bored so I figured id try a threshhold dose of DXM just to get a feel of it. I know I didnt use only the pure kind but it was all i had available. I took a bunch of calculated cup fulls and threw em down. Two hours passed and I though nothin was happening, when then all of a sudden i started feeling a bit nauseus and disoriented. Next thing I knew I woke up on my bed hot as hell feeling sick 3 hours later. I only have breif rememberences of those 3 hours but most of it is gone. And now about 20 minutes after i woke up i feel preety out of it. I wont be touching that shit again. Definitely not worth it.", "After sharing a bottle of CVS brand cough syrup, a friend and I decide to go relax in a nearby sandwich shop and wait for the DXM to kick in.  In the middle of a sandwich, I suddenly feel very dizzy and let my head droop a bit... When I looked up, it was quite apparent that the trip has started.  I am totally disoriented and for some reason my head is incredibly itchy.", "[erowid note: itchyness & allergic reactions to large doses of DXM are quite common.]", "When we get up to leave, I have a lot of trouble walking to the car. My limbs just don't want to move.  We drive down the road and stop at a gas station so my friend, M. can go to the bathroom.  While he is gone and I am in the car alone, my head is itchy badly and I realize that this is the beginning of a bad trip.", "This is my first trip on DXM, but I am an experienced tripper and I have no problem focusing and bringing myself back into a positive mood.  M. is gone for what seems like an eternity and when he comes back, I try to explain to him what I was experiencing while he was away, but he was unable to understand my feeble attempt at communicating with him.  I was GONE!!!  We drove to the nearby highschool where some of my friends were getting out of a play practice and M. decided he had to go to the shitter again.  When he came back, we went to my house. When I tried to get out of the car, I couldn't walk, and we decided that it wouldn't be good if my mom saw me like that. So, we got back in the car and left.  We knew that there weren't many places that we could go with me being in the condition I was in, so we went to his work, a fast food restaurant, where everyone would be cool with my intoxication.  After M. half carried me into the establishment, I crawled to the nearest booth, in front of many customers, and put my head down on the table.  I couldn't see anything at this point.  My vision was blurry, and I was tripping hard.  When M. pointed out some hot girls on the other side of the restaurant, I couldn't even see them.  We stayed sitting there for the next 2 hours, not knowing what to do.  Finally, when we had sobered up a little, we went back to my house and chilled.", "I'd been interested in giving DXM a try for some time, and when I had a night to myself, I decided to give it a try.  I drove down to Wal-Mart (a store which has actually asked for ID for soda pop in the past) and bought myself a bottle of Robotussin maximum cough without having to show my ID.  When I got home, I decided that this trip would not be just to get fucked up, but should have some meaning.  I meditated for a while, and burned some incense.  When I felt mentally prepared, I downed the entire bottle as quickly as possible. (9:00 P.M.)  The taste was not too bad, and kinda minty, like menthol or something.  I tried to lay down and relax, but I was nervous about purposely OD'ing on OTC cough syrup.", "After about 25 to 30 minutes, I noticed a strange feeling.  I can't really describe it, sorta like the way I feel when I first take some E, but it hasn't kicked in yet.  Just a little 'off'.  I waited some more, but it didn't get any stronger, and then disappeared.  I though 'man, what a gyp, this shit doesn't work'.  After 45 minutes, I was convinced nothing was happening, so I went for a drive.  By the time I got 15 minutes out, I started to feel weird.  I then decided to go home, as I NEVER drive when intoxicated on ANYTHING.  ", "I got home, and reality started to break apart, like the whole world was in a strobe light.  This was not a visual thing, but rather was how my brain was precieving the world.  I decided to lay down in the dark and try to relax and take in this feeling. Ok, get your bearings, relax, try to enjoy this.  Soon, I dont know how long, I could feel myself sinking downward through my bed.  I'm not one to claim mystic or spiritual experiences everytime I do drugs, but this was truly an out of body experience.  Pure 8th circuit conciousness.  I imagined people sitting on my bed next to my body, and I had conversations with them from the other end of the room.  I didn't actually talk out loud, because vocal sounds come from the body, and I had left it behind.  A few times, I worried that I was being too loud in these conversations, but I then reminded myself that this was just the drug taking hold of me.  Extremely menacing vibrations.  Impossible to understand reality.", "Eventually, I had to use the restroom.  Walking was impossible.  Total loss of all muscle coordination.  I couldent stand up, and I couldent control my legs.  This was interesting, because I could sort of watch myself behaving in this terrible way, since I was still detached from my body even though I was up and walking around.  When I got to the restroom by crawling, I turned on the lights.  I looked in the mirror, and I looked REALLY FUCKED UP.  My pupils were dialated worse than E or acid, and my skin was pale and clammy.  I thought 'shit, I've killed myself.  I'm doomed.' but it didn't really bother me too much.  It was more like 'well, guess I'm gona die soon, oh well'.  Very strange.  I was completely blasted.  More fucked up than any other drug in the world, and I've done plenty.", "I got back to bed, and resumed my experience.  I constantly began moving in and out of my body.  To me, I was dying.  It was not scary, but just interesting.  The conversations with nonexistant people continued, and I eventually fell asleep at approx. 5:00 A.M.  Weird dreams, and old memories from childhood.  Terrible nonsense.", "The next day, I woke up the happiest person on earth.  I was so glad I was alive.  Dying never really scared me, and now that I think about it, other than being trashed I had no reason to fear harm to my body.  I was just relieved.  Like when you dream that you or a family member has died, or that something terrible has happened, and it seems so real that when you wake up you are just so happy it didn't happen.  Very strange vibrations.  I had a mild hangover, similar to an alcohol hangover, but very mild.  I think I really learned something that night.  Now that I have conquored DXM, I feel that I can conquer anything.  I feel empowered, and enlightened.  I probbally will not do DXM again for at least 6 months or a year.  It was incredibly powerful.  A true spiritual pilgrimage.  This drug is not for the casual user, but is a tool for the shaman.  You'd better have your shit together if your going to boost yourself into DXM conciousness.", "For a very long time, I had a lot of negative feelings associated with drugs and their use (whether it was responsible or not), many of which I realized were irrational. Approximately 9 months ago, I became involved with someone who had a large amount of experience with substance use (experimentation, not abuse), and I was introduced to this fairly quickly (she smoked marijuana at a frat party on our first 'date'). I was completely naive in the entire realm concerning illicit (and licit) drugs. In the beginning of the relationship, I felt a false sense of openness to new experiences, probably more in an effort to impress her than anything. I smoked marijuana with her twice (feeling nothing on the first occasion, and becoming very sick on the second), and used nitrous oxide as well. I started drinking alcohol at parties with her, and sometimes smoking cigarettes, tobacco and clove. As time went on, however, I discovered how much I disliked doing these things, and that I had a very strong aversion to them. I grew to hate whenever she would smoke marijuana, or use nitrous oxide, and my entire disposition changed at these times.", "If she was going to smoke marijuana with some friends, I would completely shut her off, become extremely uncomfortable, and do anything I could to try and drive thoughts involving her drug use out of my mind. I would play very loud music on headphones, I would play violent computer games, one time I even jumped in Lake Michigan when it was quite cold. This sort of aversion to drug use put quite a strain on our relationship. On at least two occasions, it led to very nearly breaking up. There was a lot of stress and anxiety in our relationship because of this aversion I felt. And I did not lie inactive on this issue. I read as much as I could about drugs, hoping that if I were better informed on the real effects of drugs, then I would not be so violently opposed to their use. Erowid.org was my favorite site over the summer, not because I especially liked drugs, but because I thought the path to salvation of our relationship lay therein. ", "Unfortunately, mere information appeared to do nothing to change my opinions of drugs. I knew quite a bit, I thought, but I still felt many negative feelings about it. All during this time, I had the suspicion that what I really needed was some BIG event to occur, something much more than just information on a web page, to change my mind. Something like me using some drug. However, I felt so incredibly hypocritical about attempting something like that, and uncomfortable doing it in my girlfriend's presence (especially if she were using the same drug, which would inevitably be the case), that this idea remained on the back burner of my mind. ", "When I read about DXM, the dissociative anesthetic found in cough syrup that could produce trips similar to those induced by Ketamine (something I considered to be a really 'hard' drug), I knew I had found something that could serve as catalyst for that really big change I was looking for. It was easy to find, it was legal, the ingestion method was easy (I don't know how to smoke, really), and its effects were certainly nothing to be scoffed at. ", "Secretly, I bought an 8 oz bottle of generic brand Maximum Strength Cough Syrup, and put it in my drawer to think about, perhaps waiting for just the right time. On October 19, I knew it was time. My girlfriend didn't want to do anything that evening, it was the start of a weekend, my roommate was gone, and I had no work that needed to be done for that entire weekend. I felt bad that I wasn't going to tell my girlfriend what I was doing, but I was sure that it would be easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission. Also, I felt embarassed, and if it was going to produce the change I was hoping it would, it would be much easier for me to confess afterwards.", "Starting at 9:00pm, and going until 10:00pm, I drank 22 teaspoons (110mL, or approx. 3.7 oz), in quantities of 2 and 4 teaspoons. It tasted absolutely awful, but with such small quantities spaced over an ", "At about 9:30pm, I started feeling the first effects of the DXM, feeling a bit lightheaded and dizzy. I had already chosen some music for the evening, before I began ingesting the cough syrup. I had a repeated playlist of Paul Oakenfold's Tranceport, Paul Oakenfold's Ibiza Essential Mix, and BT's Ima. When I started feeling dizzy, I turned off the lights in my room, turned the music on a bit, and lay down on the couch with my eyes closed. Over the next hour, until 10:30pm, I felt the intensity of the effects increase until what I felt was a plateau. At some point in this elevation, I began having very vivid dream-like visions. I don't think I fell asleep, though I can't be certain about that. I closed my eyes, and saw wonderful things, many of them driven by the music I was listening to. The music itself was extremely enjoyable, and even now, 5 or 6 weeks after this experience, I still feel a bit of a thrill when I listen to that music. I turned into many different positions lying on the couch, and surprisingly, I was extremely comfortable in every one of them. Some of them I knew should have caused me to be uncomfortable, yet I thought I was in ergonomic bliss. I also noticed some numbing effect, at least at skin level. I pinched myself to test this, and I felt nothing. ", "On one or two occasions, I had to rise to visit the restroom, and on each occasion I had quite a bit of difficulty walking. Indeed, it felt like previous occasions on which I had been quite drunk, only this time I felt complete clarity of thought and though my walk seemed to be somewhat clumsy, I realized my movements were very deliberate, and probably appeared unusually rigid to observers, instead of unusually loose. ", "This state of having my imagination stimulated by the music continued until approximately 1:30am, when my roommate unexpectedly returned home. He not a fan of listening to Ambient Trance played at high volumes, as was the case in our room at the time of 1:30am. Also, he was not aware of my experiment that night (nor was anyone else), and is completely naive as far as drugs go, so would not have realized what was going on. Thus, when he came in at 1:30 in the morning on friday night and turned on the halogen lamp (which nearly blinded me), I felt obligated to turn down the music and try and act normal. This was a remarkable amount of change that I had to go through, in behavior and such. It took quite a bit of effort. So, the music went down, all the lights were on, and I had to act normal. At least, not under the influence of half a bottle of Robitussin. ", "I sat at my computer, playing minesweeper non-stop, trying not to make eye contact with him (I had seen my eyes in the mirror in the washroom, and knew there was little color left because my pupils were so dilated), or even speaking to him more than necessary. That same day, I had gotten a bottle of whiskey, and it was in the cabinet next to his desk. I decided to tell him that I was drunk, that I had been taking shots of whiskey. He asked if he could have some for a nightcap, and I urged him to do so. When he took the bottle out of the cabinet, he thought it a bit odd that the bottle was full, and was in fact still sealed, but he didn't think anything of it in his very tired state. As I said, he is very naive, even more naive than I was. ", "He eventually went to bed, and so I was forced to turn the music off completely. I eventually ended up lying on my bed, bunked above his, tossing and turning all night, still with intense visuals, but somewhat disturbed by the abrupt change in setting that occurred at 1:30am. ", "The next morning, I discovered I was still feeling the effects of the DXM quite strongly, and I also discovered I had an appointment to make for my job at 11am, which involved letting my superior into the building, and sitting with him, troubleshooting a computer problem, for about an hour. That was quite an exercise in appearing normal, or at least just hungover (from alcohol). I don't know how well I pulled it off, but he didn't seem to notice anything out of the ordinary, even with my pupils still fully dilated, my walk clumsy, and my speech somewhat stuttering. Eventually, that ended, and I was able to return to my room. ", "This feeling of being strung out last for 3 days. I am sure this was aggravated by the fact that between 9:00pm on friday night, and 9:00pm on the following night, I ate and drank nothing. ", "As for the effect this experience had on my psyche, it had completely the desired effect, and then some. It reversed my entire philosophy on drugs completely. It surprised my girlfriend so much so that she remained mystified by my change until perhaps 3 weeks ago. Since this experience, I have read voraciously on the topic of psychedelics, most hallucinogens. I have developed a very specific personal regime about what drugs I will allow myself to experiment with, and which ones I won't. I have become much more confident in making decisions concerning personal policy in this area. I never liked the taste of alcohol or alcoholic beverages, but I always thought I'd drink them anyway. Now, I know it's really not worth the trouble, and I have given alcohol up completely. I will not do amphetamines, opiates, or narcotics. I will always be as informed as possible about a drug before I experiment with it. I have read everything by Leary and Huxley that I can get my hands on, as well as numerous articles and books about altered states of consciousness (including The Natural Mind by Andrew Weil), I bought PIHKAL and have been reading it with much enjoyment, and I have talked to many people for hours, whom I had shied away from previously because I knew they used, or approved of the use of, drugs. ", "After this experience, I find myself changed greatly, moreso than I ever thought possible, and I LOVE IT! I don't think it could have turned out any better. The evening of the experience, just an hour or two into it, I knew it was just what I had been looking for, and the joy I felt in that realization is indescribable. I felt like whooping and throwing up my arms in ecstasy. That probably added quite a bit to my entire DXM experience. I still feel thrills when I think about how it acted as such a catalyst for radical changes in my life. Now I look forward to going home for Thanksgiving, and seeing everyone in a new light. My high school friends may not approve of my new found lifestyle, but I can't be bothered by that sort of disapproval. I am still basically the same person, but I think I am immensely improved, and I would not give this up for anything. ", "P.S. - two weeks later, I decided to try the DXM experience again, this time drinking the rest of the bottle in one go (4.3 oz), along with grapefruit juice and EZ Cheese. That was incredibly awful. An hour later, I was puking in the bathroom, barely even making it to the bathroom to do that. It was the first time I had vomited since I was two, when I drank liquid candle, perfume, and heart medicine, on 3 separate occasions. Since then, I have sworn to never again take cough syrup, whether for its intended purpose or not, and I will only use pure DXM, if at all.", "I tried DXM for the first time about two weeks ago. I took 300 mg (10 Drixoral Cough Caps @ 30mg each). Result: no effect. I took the 10 pills over the course of about 20 minutes chased with plenty of water. I did take them on a relatively full stomach, though, so maybe that was part of the problem. I'm 6'3', 280 lbs and in relatively good health.", "========================================================================", "I have heard people having great time with DXM, but it didn't work for me. Does anyone know what's the problem. I took 375 mg of Dextrometorphan hydrobromide. Is that right compound ? If it is did I take enuff ? Or am I some kind of tolerated to that stuff ? Should I try again with greater dose ? Any help is greatly valued.", "=========================================================================", "After reading the DXM FAQ and psyching myself up, I decided to take 300 mg of DXM with two other friends. To make a long story short -- IT SUCKS! All it does is that it makes you dizzy, itchy, and irritable. Not exactly my idea of recreation, and much less mind opening drug. Here's a little piece of advice to all of you out there, don't bother with DXM -- IT'S CRAP! I'd much rather sniff glue or swallow gasoline or even smell Heliumm than ever try that shit again. YUCK!!!", "=========================================================================", "I just thought I would relate *my* experience with robo. I drank a 4 oz bottle of d-methorphan syrup (no guifenisen). While the high was not exactly unpleasant it was definitely fucked up wierd. sort of a dreamy stupor, didn't care what was going on around me, etc. the two side effects, were: one It was very difficult to urinate (this effect lasted for a couple of days), and two, the dopiness lasted (gradually wearing off) for three days. If you try robo, don't plan on going to work or doing anything significant for a couple of days, perahps you will be able to, but I couldn't, and you might not either.", "In conclusion, I would have to say that one has to be feeling VERY dysphoric, and/or desperate for a high to take robo. it definitely will get you fucked up, but pleasure? not much if any.", "==========================================================================", "After reading, and printing out pages and pages of info on tripping from Robitussin, I decided to try it last night. I bought two 4-ounce bottles of the Robo Maximum Strength Cough (only active ingred= dextro hydrobromide) for about seven dollars at a supermarket. I downed one bottle of the nasty stuff at about 6pm, afterwhich I smoked a good size bowl. Since I was quite stoned (and on new weed) I didn't know when the effects started kicking in, I downed another two ounces from the second bottle, and by 7 pm I was starting to feel quite weird.", "Lemme just say, first, that I am fairly well experienced with other assorted psychoactives- I tried this out of curiousity since Robo is, of course, cheap and plentiful.", "By 7:15 or so my eyes felt very heavy and, as for the rest of the night, wouldn't focus in once place for very long... So, as any good tripper will do, I turned off the lights :-) I wasn't getting much in the way of hallucinations at that time anyway. Music sounded 'thin and boring' compared to LSD or Psilocybin, and I started becoming too disoriented and unbalanced to walk anywhere. I closed my eyes for a while and enjoyed the show- this stuff gave a big coloful boost to my imagination, and had somewhat the same 'mind-tripping' effects other psychoacts. give.", "I felt a bit of stomach discomfort, which is understandable looking back on how much of it I drank.

I took 240mg. After about 1 hour I started to get nasueas and a little dizzy. After throwing up twice (I have a sensitive stomache) I felt better but the feeling never became more than a buzz. I didn;t particularly care for the feeling either. I was nothing like tripping as far as I'm concerned. This may be due to the dosage but I would rather not try it again because of the nasuea. Overall it was an interesting experiment but I do not see what all the rave is about. The buzz felt kind of synthetic. More related to the previous message I can say that I did experience some starnge visual problems. Especially with light and depth perception.

We went to the store and looked at all the different types and found the one that contained the highest concentration of DXM, and didn't have anything else in it.  At about 6:30, I poured the whole bottle in a cup, closed my nose and pounded it down.  It wasn't as bad as I had expected, but the aftertaste was terrible and I couldn't get rid of it with cigarettes or alcohol.  After an hour or so, it started to kick in, so I decided to play some playstation to pass the time.  I began to get more and more fucked up.  I had techno playing on my computer with visualization effects, and the music sounded so good and the  visuals looked so cool.  It was too distracting and I had to stop playing playstation and went to see my friend who was almost passed out and neither of us could walk very well.", "Later on (I totally lost all concept of time), another friend came down and we smoked some bong hits, and the weed made the visuals kick in.  Everything started moving with wave-like motion, and it was nearly impossible to concentrate on anything.  I think I staggered around the dorm for a while and everyone who saw me said I looked more fucked up than they had ever seen anyone.  Finally, at 12:30 or 1, I laid down and found it surprisingly easy to fall asleep.  The next day I was very groggy and felt kind of stupid, but nothing like the night before.  I have done just about all the drugs there are, and I have to say that one five dollar bottle of cough syrup from the grocery store fucked me up more than anything else I have ever done.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to trip.  I thought it was better than acid, because it was less of a mind fuck and wasn't so goddamn hard to get to sleep on.", "Now for my description of the trip. Hopefully it may help other would-be first time experimenters of DXM. I can't vouch for the experiences of my two friends who also made this their first DXM experience but will include some of their observations where necessary. All three of us decided that 300mg was the best dose and consequently downed a 100mL bottle of Robitussin DM at 3mg/mL. I'm not sure about in the States but here, Robitussin DM also contains Guaiphenesin which apparently causes vomiting and/or the shits. Well admittedly I did get the shits once but any unpleasant effects (of which there were next to none for the whole duration) were vastly outweighed by the pleasant effects which, to me at least, were numerous. I didn't eat anything all day and so, had a completely empty stomach. Both of my friends had eaten a couple of hours beforehand. One had the shits quite a lot and the other vomited once.", "We downed the whole bottle around 7pm and half an hour later, started to feel 'intoxicated'; similar to alcohol intoxication. About fifteen minutes later, we shared a joint and then all lay down on our matresses and put some good music on, Miles Davis' 'Bitches Brew'. Soon, the effects began to become noticable. I just felt very comfortable lying down with my eyes shut. The best way I can describe how I felt was that it was like dreaming except that I was awake ... something like lucid dreaming. At this point and indeed for the reat of the trip, I'd be thinking of things and then I'd be 'virtually' acting these things out in my head. Closed-eye visuals weren't very common nor were they vivid, though I imagine at a higher dose they'd be far more obvious and intense. Despite this, I could visualize in my mind's eye what I was thinking. After a while, I decided to change the music and went to stand up. I just soared into a standing position and then lurched about a little but felt very light. The music I chose was some hard trance. It went down well and by now I was beginning to notice the amazing effects of the music. I can't really say how long into the trip I was because I simply didn't think of time but it was probably two hours since ingestion. At this stage, I decided another smoke was in order so I packed a few cones (bowls) and one of my friends joined me. The other appeared to be asleep. After this, I changed the music to Enigma's second one and this is when the really intense and pleasurable aspects of the trip reached their highest point.", "I lay down as usual and returned to my dream-like state. The music just felt superb and flowed right through my body. I'd lost quite a bit of sensation in my body and it seemed to merge with the music like pure energy. I find it a most difficult, in fact, impossible thing to describe. It was at this point that I decided the porcelain bus needed a visitor. However, I was so utterly comfortable and the sensations felt so superb that I just didn't have the desire to get up and go. Eventually, I arrived at the conclusion that if I did go, I'd be a lot more comfortable when I returned. I was a little annoyed that I'd have to leave this dream-like state and probably not be able to return to it. Not so! When I returned from the toilet, I was very pleased to discover I could just go straight back to the dream-like state I'd been in ... including all the merging, like energy with the music. When Enigma finished, I spent about ten minutes trying to decide what to put on next before realising that nothing in my collection could possibly match the superb sounds and sensations of Enigma so I whacked it straight back on. After it ended for the second time, I put on a compiation CD of mellow trance and began my decent into real sleep. The trip wasn't so much wearing off (though it probably was physiologically) my dream-like DXM state was just merging with the approaching sleep that was to overtake the experience. It may have been about 1am. ", "I awoke at 8:30am in the morning feeling absolutely fine. No hangovers and no ill effects of any other kind. About half an hour before I'd drifted off the night before, my head had been pounding, like a bad hangover. Still not bad enough to become unpleasant, but noticable all the same. In the morning though, there were no ill-effects whatsoever. We all went for a skate a few hours later and I've felt nothing untoward since. ", "In conclusion, this first experience with 300mg was superb and has ensured that I'll do it again soon, probably with 450mg. It was definitely a second plateau trip though most likely at the beginning, in other words, far from nearing a third and still leaving much in the second to be discovered next time. My recommendations based on this first experience are these:", "1. No food on the day you intend on tripping with DXM. I had the fewest unpleasant effects and my two friends had eaten that day.", "2. For first time users: Start with a small dose; no more than 300mg. I imagine that if I'd taken any larger a dose (400-600mg) I would probably have freaked a little bit. A few times during the experience, some sensations were difficult to explain to myself but owing to the relatively small dose, I was easily able to deal with these. At a higher dose, it would most likely have been more difficult to do this.", "3. Set and Setting are very important as far as I can tell. I'd made my loungeroom very homely with coloured lights, comfortable surroundings, and most importantly, a good stereo with speakers in different corners of the room. I imagine headphones would be even more brilliant but there were three of us and only one stereo. I tried a variety of music styles but by far the most superb was Enigma. Electronic music with plenty of deep bass felt the best.", "4. Smoke some herb some time after ingestion. The three of us agreed that smoking the joint half an hour after ingestion was too soon but the cone/bowl maybe two hours into it really brought on the enjoyable effects and added to them.", "Anyway ... This first experience with 300mg was all good, IMO. Next time I'll be trying 450mg as I've decided to go slowly so as to minimize the likelyhood of having to deal with too much at once. One of my friends thought the experience was good enough at 300mg and that he probably wouldn't bother with a higer dose as a result. Sorry for the length of this post but I thought it might help those interested in trying DXM for the first time. Thanks again for those who emailed advice my way over the past week.", "After a strange week i felt I was prepared for the second plateau experience with Dex. I had done 2 oz two times previously and knew what the first plateau was like. After reading the Faq on the stuff I wanted to proceed slowly and carefully being that there is potential danger. I am mainly experienced with LSD, Shrooms, Peyote, Nutmeg, and Cannabis. This is different from all.", "After preparation, over a period of about half and hour I consumed a 4 oz bottle of Robitussin Maximum strength. There were no active ingredients other than the Dex. Soon after I drank the last of it, I had some unexpected visitors. Oh shit, what do I do now?? How do you get people to get the hell away from you without being rude?? I read the Faq about this stuff turning people into anti-social, paranoid assholes and did not want to be like that, so I was kind and offered food and weed to them and eventually they left. At one point before they left, my burger did not taste as interesting as I wanted it to so I just layed it down and walked away saying something like, 'I lost my appetite.' I have not eaten anything sense. You can't just tell someone 'You have to leave now, I just drank a bottle of cough syrup and expect to trip.'  By the time they were gone an hour had passed and I was well into the effects. ", "I felt like walking aroung a lot and had to put on some music...Tool. Perfect. Now time for a bowl, it just enhaced the effects I was already having. This was just as I had planned, intelligent conversation with my wife was easy (even though I had just finished making absolutely no sense to my friends what so ever.)This is when I realized there were different personalities surfacing. I could switch from intellectual, to brave guy, to playful little boy, to lost little boy, to funny party guy, to paranoid, and more. I have not been able to identify all of these yet nor describe them. My ability to control this was at will, which was encouraging. At one point I declared I was Disney World and would perform Magic but when I tried to, I forgot what I was trying to do. I felt like I was about 4 years old again. This was most enoyable because I could play like a kid and not worry about responsibility. This lasted for about three hours, until I was ready to chill.", " We went to bed and put on music. This had a negative effect, I started to get real self critical and was making sure I had treated everyone with respect and all that kind of stuff. I tried to shift the phase and work on deep breathing and maybe even some Spiritual work, but the cat was not leaving my pillow so it was hard to concentrate with her energy all over me keeping me grounded which was prolly good anyway. When I awoke this morning, I was still feeling the effects and can feel a bit now. ", "This is a powerful experience and will continue to explore my own persona. Peace and Love to all new and old explorers. Have fun and be careful. Read all the info you can get before trying this it is a powerful change and you need to be ready for what will take place.", "Well, I had an experience with some extremely dangerous drugs a few days ago. I used to drink a bottle of Robitussin for fun. Well, I found some concentrated DXM in pill form. My friend, 'O' and I decided to have some fun. A bottle like I used to drink had about 220 milligrams of dextromethorphan. We each took 720 milligrams. About two hours later, back at our house it hit us. I started getting some weird visuals on the wall. 'O' was zonked out and freaked out lying on the couch. We both started hearing crazy sounds. We had total loss of any motor skills. My friend 'R' paged me and asked me to come over to the tavern. I was in no shape to drive and explained this to him and he said okay.", "I finally convinced O to unfold the couch-bed so that we could both lie down. He did so and I climbed aboard. The entire room was spinning and we could not keep focus on anything. 'Just sleep it off, we thought...'", "I got caught in a nasty time-loop. I experienced Hell. I thought that my basement was the only existent Universe and Jason and I were doomed to live it out in this horrible state for all eternity. God was finally punishing us for our foolish sins. I experienced the same events over and over again. Seeing my legs, leaving the bed, looking at my pager, returning to my bed, leaving my body, and then seeing my legs again. Each time I left my body, it seemed days, years, eons passed, but each time I looked at my pager only one minute had passed.", "We both thought that we were dying or very close to it. I felt my soul being ripped from my body. I tried to contain it, but my body began to strech and pull and my head started to get yanked from my neck. I could only console myself by assuring myself that we did not do enough to overdose. Intense visuals of torment. I could hear people screaming and dying. I knew my life was about to end.", "I woke up about six hours later and we were back to the ground. I was wearing a robe and the entire basement was trashed. We were still heavily high, and we spent the next hour talking about the trip. We then cleaned everything up, got some breakfast and headed to work. I am still high as write this now.", "That stuff makes pure LSD seem like ginger beer. There is no comparison. DXM is by far the most intense shit I have ever done.", "I had read alot about DXM, but had yet to try it.  I have never done any other hallucinagens ie. acid or shrooms because I heard they make you go nuts and loud.  Im only 16 so I sit in my basement with my parents sleeping 2 floors over me, so I need to try to be calm.", "The day before I went to the store and bought 2 8oz bottles of Robitussin extra strength (for me and my friend who would be joining me).  He came over around 9 PM.  I downloaded the Psychedelic Screen Saver to look at.  I got some food, and drinks.  At around 12:05 AM we each drank our bottle.  I was very excited and looking forward to what would happen.", "The only thing I could think was GROSS!  It tasted so bad.  He finished his no problem, but I had to slowly take it down.  Afterwards we went out, and watched TV.", "At around 12:45 he asked if I was feeling anything.  I had nothing except feeling light-headed , the 'robo-itch' I read about (it wasnt that bad), and the worst stomach ache of my life. He apperently was seeing things as he said.  I couldn't take the pain in my gut anymore.  Although I feared it would get out of my system, I went upstairs and puked my guts out.", "I came downstairs to find my friend swinging a paper towel roll calling it his sword.  Everytime he swung it, it left huge trails.", "I then turned on a spinning ball of light (a black ball that turns, and it has different lights that project).  I laid on my back and looked at the ceiling.  In the center of a red ball it looked like a shrouded figure was trying to get out.  It looked like a face behind mist, trying very hard to swim to us.  I watched in confusion, until I started to spin up to it.", "I felt myself rising up high off the ground.  I closed my eyes for a minute, and I saw a huge pointy disc of color swirling behind my eyes.  When I opened them I saw the red light turn into a big glowing bird.  I fell back to ground.  My friend then asked if I saw the bird, which I did (I thought this was odd for 2 people to see the same thing...).  He started explaining that the bird was in the circle of life and death.  The red light would kill the living and awaken the dead.  He began to ask it questions about himself.  He seemed so lost in thought, I decided not to disturb him.", "I looked at the light, and felt it was calling me.  I reached up to it, and my friend screamed to me 'STOP!  It'll kill you!'  I obeyed very quickly.  He said to look over at the couch, where I could see the dead guy.  I looked over, and I saw a pile of blankets and stuff that did resemble a guy.  We laid on our backs until 2:30.  We got up and we wanted ice cream.  We managed to walk up a wobbling stair case and quietly get ice cream.  Then coming back down was harder than going up.", "At around 3 we were coming down fast.  I began to feel very drunk, which I didnt like at all!  I felt tipsy (which I had before, but enjoyed it then), naseaus, and really weird in general.  I laid down, hoping to fall asleep, but I couldnt.  After 2 hours of laying there feeling like absolute shit, I feel asleep.  I woke up like 30 mins ago.  My friend is still asleep.  Its 10:55 AM, I still feel a little queasy, but Im good.  ", "In retrospect, DXM was so much fun.  I felt like I knew everything, and could be taught anything.  Of course, I will NEVER EVER drink syrup again.  Throwing up was so bad.  I will just find pills from now on.  I also wonder why I got drunk.  It may have been the 1.4% in it (even thought thats not much), or something else, but Im sticking to pills.  Syrup is tooooo gross.", "After a good day of work and vigorous excercise, I decided that this particular weekend would be a good time to have another DXM journey. I had been preparing the week before, somewhat (set and setting... I had robo'd once before) and had nothing important the next day and a relaxing day planned for Sunday.", "So at about 7:30 pm, Friday, I (wince) struggled down an 8oz bottle of genuine Robo - with copius amounts of water. Took a short walk and came back, slightly buzzed. Powertoked 5 bowls and got ready for the journey ahead. Whoops, almost forgot to set up the CD changer... okay, Jimi Hendrix: Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, Electric Ladyland, and some mild techno afterwards. I also got some more techno ready for a mid-trip changeover.", "8:45, headphones on, lights off. Let's start the ride. Ya see, Jimi is a new experience for me, and I got the three discs during the week before. With my eyes closed, the music started to fill my consciousness and the colorful, albeit dark visuals started. What I really like about DXM is that for the trip, you're always in control. _I_ decided to start moving (flying) over the landscape, where to move, what to see. What I also noticed is that when I returned to the couch after physically geting up and going to the bathroom, I was in an ante-room of sorts, just waiting until I decided that it was time to journey forth again.", "So during this trip, I decided to enter people's houses. I saw some very interesting things. One particularly striking visual was that of people fucking. I was able to zoom in directly to the point of penetration and watch - better than pornos, to be sure. I didn't try to interrupt them or to reach out and touch - in fact, I don't think I've every thought about touching things while journeying. Maybe I'll make a concerted effort to try, next time.", "All during this trip, I was an ethereal spirit, being able to move about and through objects as I saw fit. I was also able to see myself lying on the couch, before I returned to my body to change music, etc. About the music... ahhhh WOW!!! Jimi is incredible. The variety of music, the production of the music (definitely meant for tripping), and Jimi's guitar virtuosity.", "I also spoke to people. Or copies of people, I'm not sure which. At the time I was talking to these people (on my journey) there was a thought in the back of my head - 'Am I making up what these people are responding to me, or are they wandering spirits themselves who are talking to me on their own?' I was never able to figure that one out - maybe next time.", "In bed asleep (somewhat) around 3am. Woke up (if you can call it that) at 11. All day was somewhat of a blur, what with double vision not clearing up until about noon on Sunday. I slept on and off on Saturday, mixed with watching cheesy movies on cable. Put on the headphones with the same music that night (powertoked some more) and had some more mild visuals.", "Sunday I went to an afternoon rave. Driving was a challenge but certainly doable with concentration. The rave was excellent (as this particular one always is.) I wasn't able to dance as vigorously as usual, but I was particularly animated and alive. I had a particularly wild look in my eyes (so said some) and an infectuously good mood. I was also much more sociable than normal.", "Monday dragged on. Tried to work out, but the muscles just complained. Couldn't concentrate too well at work, and a bit of the DXM haze remained. Tuesday that cleared up, but my body was still taxed. By Wednesday, all seemed back to what could be considered normal.", "One thing that I enjoy about DXM tripping vs. LSD is that you actually _go_ places while tripping on DXM. LSD for me is a contemplative, mental examination with lots of cool looking visuals. But, while acid tripping, I always am cognizant of the real place that I'm at, and all of the things that surround me. DXM, on the other hand, is a journey to a different place - sometimes a different time. A real trip - one that leaves me exhausted, but really worked up.", "I was selling pure DXM powder in capsules.  I know it wasn't smart... but I did it.  The main reason i sold it was I bought 100g of the shit, and got really sick of it.  It quit working for me somewhere around the 125th time I did it (95% of the time 3rd plateau or higher, 700mg+)  I had done robo, vicks, coro, and another smaller batch of powder.", "I was packaging it up in 350mg caps and selling it to a kid I knew for about a year.  he knew what it was, and how much was in it.  I was doing this at school.  He was selling it at school to people he didnt really know.  He sold it to one guy who started puking and decided to go to the office, and passed out on the way there.  I know how stupid it is to take DXM at school, especially for the first time, but apparently the guy who i sold to didnt tell them this.", "Well the kid woke up in the office and told them what he took and where he got it (the guy I sold to was telling them it was DXM, but they didnt know what DXM was).  The guy went to the office and told them where he got it (me) and told them EVERYONE he sold to.", "I was taken to the office and the cops were called.  The cops had the bottle he had the pills in.  I have given him 25 350mg dxm pills and 3 pills of 350mg dxm + 150mg BZP.  They had 2 pills of dxm+bzp and that's it.  I told them what happened (because a lot of people knew I was the source, and I wouldve been in more trouble if I hadnt talked) and where I got it, and they went and searched my house (my mom signed the thing).  they found about 5g of bzp, 20g of dxm, 250mg 2ct7, 500mg amt, 1g 5x salvia, 6 vicodin es, some ephedra pills, a pipe w/ resin in it, and my deering 2g scale.", "I am charged with 'Buy/possess drug paraphernalia' and 'Poss for sale/transfer of a simulated controlled substance' (for the dxm).  1 count of each.  I guess they couldnt identify anything else.  I'm going to end up going to some drug program probably.  I know I'd be in much more trouble if i was caught with ecstasy or something, but I still am gonna have to put up with the drug program.", "I'm sure if I got a good lawyer I could get off the hook, but I can't afford that.

So i went out and for 5 dollars bought a store brand 8oz bottle of extra strenth tussin. When i got home, to my joy i found i had a unopened 4oz bottle of extra strenth tussin already!", "9:30 I finished off both bottles, it tastes nasty, i washed my mouth out and brushed my teeth to try to get the taste out, it work.", "10:00 fealing drunkish, similar to a 350mg dxm dose.", "10:30 There seems to be a lot of white in my vision, i cant read too clearly, and when i stare at something, i get double vision.

Way too much. I puked my brains out. I only got half of it down. Figuring that it wasn't going to affect me at all I took several bong hits (to ease my stomach mostly.) About 3 hours after the bong hits I realized that I was WAY more stoned than I should have been. OK cool, so I absorbed some of the DXM/DXO, and the extraction did work.", "I tried again. This time I used 2 tablespoons of citric acid with four 4-oz bottles of Tussin max (generic robo max).  With a 90% yield of extraction (probably higher though) it would put me at about 16-18 mg/kg. Upper third plateau lower fourth. ", "I drank the solution with ease at 1:20 PM. Didn't even feel sick at all. Twenty minutes later I started to feel that buzz, light-headed, and my vision started slowing down, felt like I was seeing things in frames.", "Realizing that the DXM was getting a lot stronger a lot more quickly than my normal 4-oz dose, I began to prepare for the rest of the day. I put in my favorite tripping music, Roger Waters' Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, and put it on repeat.", "I felt the normal 4-oz peak at 30 minutes into the trip. Ten minutes later I couldn't really focus on anything, partly because I was messed up, and partly because I couldn't tell the difference between one object and the next. It seems like nothing was real. Things started mixing around with other things, and I decided that if I couldn't see I should just close my eyes. When I did that I saw really weird walls and objects (mostly black red and purple colored). I started accelerating and moving really fast through those objects. I felt like I was an F-16 trying to do a canyon run. The objects were zooming by so fast it was unbelievable. It started to go with the music (I think). This went on for a good 20 minutes with my eyes closed and all. ", "My friend who was trip sitting thought I had passed out, he touched me, and I opened my eyes and tried to look at him. I tried to say I'm ok, but I don't know what came out. Then I realized something was really wrong. There was something I really needed to do, I didn't know what it was at first. I tried to think. That didn't work so I stopped thinking. I instinctively stood up. I took a step, and then fell to my hands and knees. I started to crawl. My conscious mind had no Idea of where I was going, but I didn't seem to care. I got to the bathroom. I thought, OHH that's what's wrong, I have to pee. I stood up leaned over the toilet and peed for a very very long time (so it seemed, but I think it actually was a pretty big pee). I crawled back to the couch and layed down to go to the canyon, this time it wasn't really a canyon, more like a merry go round, spinning really fast. Then I felt like I was flipping in all sorts of directions. Spinning and flipping and zooming around in this little fake world I created in my head. ", "My friend checked up on my after about 15 minutes, (so he told me) I remember opening my eyes. I saw him, but everything was glazed over with a bright white light. I saw his face, and I saw a white light, that's all. I said I was ok, (at least I tried).  I then closed my eyes again. The spinning and flipping was the last thing I saw. At this point I have about a 2-hour memory lapse. I can't remember a thing that went on inside my head, I really wish I did though.  My friend said he checked up on me every 20 minutes or so and I said something that sounded like 'I fi'.", "The next thing that I remember was I was looking down at my body from above my head.  I was thinking, 'What is this, what are all these things around this thing'. A thought popped into my head, it said, this body is you. I was very confused. It was as if I had never seen my body before and I didn't even know I had a body. I knew that I existed, but what is that silly chunk of meat there sitting on that couch. That couldn't be me, how could I possibly be that, that thought of me being that chunk of meant was stupid to me. SO, I tried to think of who I really was, my name popped into my head, it sounded really weird, but I knew it was my name. So finally I convinced myself that the body is in fact a body, and it is in fact MY body. I think that was me coming down from the 4th plateau (the 4th plateau of which I have no memory of). I then went back to my body, and looked around the room, it was 4 PM. ", "MY vision was going at about a frame a second, and everything still had a white glaze to it. I sat back and listened to the music that was still repeating, I stared at a white wall (it's usually brown) in which I saw geometric patterns (changing at about a frame a second). This lasted for a good 2-3 hours when I finally got back to the 2nd plateau stoned feeling (ahh, comfortable territory). But still my vision was only recycling at about 2 frames a second. This 2nd plateau stoned feeling went on for the rest of the night until I went to bed at 12.  ", "I woke up 10 hours later with a little headache, but nothing 2 Advil won't cure. ", "It was a really really really cool experience and next time I try it I'm going to make it a point to remember what happens at the 4th plateau.", "Recently, after having used DXM several times, I decided to splurge and go for a bigger dose. I picked up 3 packets of sucrets extra strength cough lozenges that had 900mg of DXM between them. I took 600mg (36 tablets) and a friend of mine who'd never tried it before had 300mg (18 tablets). Unfortunately I couldn't find anything that had a higher concentration of DXM per tablet, but it was good enough and went down with reasonable ease. ", "I experienced the usual coming up effects; slight nausea and the sensation that my head was being compressed gently as if I was wearing a baseball cap. We drove around for a while then went to my friends house and listened to some really trippy music with a strobe light on. Eventually we got around popping in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (which I think was a mistake) The movie started and I began slowly losing my sense of where when and who I was. By the time we were a few minutes into the movie I was totally gone (about an hour after dosing up).  I seemed to get caught in a bit of a loop. My perception would change to something and then I would perceive that as being where I had always been. I would be sitting somewhere, for instance, then suddenly something in my mind would snap and I'd start over again and everything looked qualitatively different in an unexplainable way. Once I went to the bathroom because I thought I was going to be sick and when I was in the bathroom I had no idea when I had actually left and gone to the bathroom or how I had gotten there. Even though I was probably only in there for a few minutes, it felt like I had been there all night. When I went back to the room where my friends were watching the movie everything looked different, as if I was there on a different day at a different time in a different life. I guess the easiest way to explain it would be to say that my physical vision was intact (although rather stuttered and blurry) and the invisible elements - the where, when and why that were being seen through some hideous ever-changing kaleidoscope. ", "Somewhere along the way (probably about two hours in) I began losing larger and larger periods of time. I would snap to and wonder where I was and what was going on and how I got where I was (and bother my sober friend by repeatedly asking him these questions!) This was the first significant difference I noticed between 300mg and 600mg. Every time I noticed the movie that we were watching it would have advanced significantly (in the order of 10-15 minutes). I'm not sure what happened in between these portions but I can only assume I was staring off in a catatonic stupor or just plain vegging out. It was around this time too that I began to realize that I was going to die. I was afraid at first, well, terrified actually. It wasn't an urgent feeling, just a realization that I was going to die tonight because I had overdosed. I told my friends that I was going to die and they laughed at me. My entire life seemed to appear in a new light and a different philosophy of people unveiled itself to me. I thought of what my parents would think and my friends and everyone I knew and I realized that it wasn't really going to matter after all. It became apparent that I take life's pressures far to seriously and I endow too many people positions of superiority over me in my minds eye. I was satisfied with this, but still felt a bit overwhelmed by my impending destiny.", "I didn't realize how much I'd gone under till we turned the lights on and went to get a drink. I was like an airliner pilot on a coffee break with my body on autopilot. My body seemed to walk itself (teetering all the way) down the curved staircase and into the kitchen as if some primitive subroutine was struggling at this new task of directing it. My own voice was far away from me as well. It felt as though my existence had been spliced and my higher mental functions resided far away from this now in control simpleton. Then (much to my amusement) my body jumped around in circles and laughed without my direction! I was witnessing this kind of behavior but was unable to control it at all.", "It was around then that we decided to call it a night (although it was still fairly early) My sober friend and I got into his van and began to drive home (a 1/2 hour drive). My friend told me I talked to him all the way home, but on the way I remember only actually consciously talking several times. Every time I snapped to I'd start talking about things I'd already talked about (not having any recollection of the previous few minutes of conversation).", "When I got in my house I had pronounced double vision (my pupils must have been the size of dimes) Light really hurt my eyes. I found it easier to navigate dark rooms than ones with the lights on. Time dilation increased to absurd proportions. The next ten minutes lasted hours. I ", "had to go to the bathroom, but wasn't able to coordinate myself to do so. I stumbled back and forth through my house forgetting where I was going and wondering where my friends had gone then realizing that they were 1/2 hour away then wondering where they went again. This kept on and even got worse. I couldn't sleep because my heart was racing insanely and I got the impression that I was going to die again. I tried to go on my computer but the screen was bulging and was way to intense for me to even look at. After a few more eternal hours I managed to go to sleep.", "Overall it was an enjoyable experience. Neither the nausea at the beginning nor the delusion at the end was enough to dampen the enjoyable aspects in the middle. The 1-2 hour 'zone' in the middle of DXM trips truly rocks, it's like a mellowed out ecstasy drunkenness. Of course, it's not something worth dying for and I'm not sure I'd ever do 600mg again after the ride I went on.", "Friday night I had discussed the use of tussin recreationally with my roommate Rousey and his friend Jermey.  They both seemed up for the experience, especially Jermey, who decided to start off with 8oz.  The plan was to trip Saturday night here at home during Havard's 21st b-day party.", "Saturday I had to be at work at 8am.  I had only been on the job for about a week and still had a lot to learn.  I work for a very large pizza franchise and my boss and I had to mix a large quantity of dough for the day.  I only had about 4 hours of sleep the night before and was very tired.", "I left work around 4:30pm and went straight home where some people were already showing up for the party.  Havard and his older brother Steve were there along with Rousey, Matt and a few others.  Kevin, my other roommate, had to work that night so he wasn't going to be showing up for awhile.", "Around 5 I left and went to a few places to buy some Robotussin Maximum Strength Cough... four bottles to be exact.  I also picked up a big bottle of water, some gum, a bag of charcoal for the bar-b-q and two packs of cigarettes.  I'm a very heavy chain-smoker and figured I'd run out if I didn't buy at least two packs.  The big shocker was that when I went into Wal-Mart to buy the fourth bottle of tussin I found another pack of cigs in my coat that I hadn't worn in about 3 weeks.", "When I got back to the house with my purchases Rousey and Jermey wondered why I hadn't told them I was going to get tussin.  They had already been drinking and I informed them that DXM and alcohol probably wasn't a very good mix.  They agreed and decided to try it some other time.", "I went into my room and got online to work on my journal.  When I was finished I cleaned my room.  I have to have my room clean when I'm going to fry, otherwise I wig out during the trip and feel like I'm going to kill myself on some stray dirty sock on the floor.  After one menacing dirty clothes experience on tussin you really don't want to have a repeat threat the next time.", "I suppose I should indulge in my past tussin experiences a little.  I first tried tussin after a stray click landed me deep in the middle of DXM reports on the net.  I read everything there was to read about tussin... including 60% of the trip reports for DXM.  I'd never fried before and was wanting to and tussin seemed like a good way to start.  I'd had some good highs from weed, and done everything imaginable on/with alcohol.  But I wanted to fry.  The trip reports really helped my decision.  Especially the descriptions of all of the negative side effects.  I wanted to know what I was getting into.", "My first time was with Robo Honey Cough.  Kevin and I split an 8oz bottle just to try it out.  Kevin had trouble choking it down, but I ingested it like stewed fruit.  It was a life changing experience no doubt.  I didn't really fry that first time, but my mind opened up to the idea that a small quantity of a substance can really fuck you up for 6 hours.  I felt like I was drunk the whole time.  It was great.", "I started drinking RoboMax Cough after that, and was surprised to find the taste pleasant.  I could slam a whole 4oz bottle in a matter of seconds.  I was having a blast with the stuff.  Only after I became used to randomly itching and not really understanding past/present/future I tried 8oz with my friend Cody.  Cody has done a lot of different drugs over the years, but he had never tried a dissociative.", "He had 4oz and fried hardcore.  My experience that night was incredibly beautiful.  Music was amazing.  Nothing mattered.  Time was only a memory.  At one point I was a beautiful flower in an incredibly large pasture.  Cody and I melted into the couch.  I gasped and quit breathing, my heart stopped.  I was alone in my mind.  I loved it.  I had been told about needing a strong mind to be able to handle yourself under intense chemical situations.  I am very calm inside.  I love everything.  I have a 165 IQ.  ", "I figured it would be a breeze.  I was wrong.  I was rough.  I had to hold onto myself from the inside.  I didn't know what was going on, who I was, or if I would ever be normal again.  I spun around inside myself all night long.  BUT I HAD A FUCKING BLAST!!!  I am fairly strong minded.  I was able to keep from wigging out.  I had a hold on myself... until about 5 o'clock in the morning.  I finally went to sleep.  I slept about 30 minutes.  I had a beautiful blue dream.  Blue is the color of peace inside me.  As long as everything was blue I was alright.", "I was in what seemed like a sea of bodies for people Robotripping.  We were all at peace.  The people around me were all various shades of blue.  But then one girl in the middle turned the most awful shade of red I knew existed.  She was wigging out bad.  It was so real to me.  Cody tried to call a number on the RoboMax bottle to get help for the girl.  I awoke and sat straight up in bed.  panicking.  Cody was laying there next to me.  He was still sleeping.  All the lights in my room were on, but it was so dark. ", "I needed water bad, but our water had been turned off two days before.  I crawled into the living room and tried to come down.  I wanted to sleep again.  I wanted to be sober.  It was light outside and I was still frying.  I had to be at work in 4 hours.  I was gonna die.  I dragged myself to the bathroom and puked.  It felt like I puked for an hour.  I wanted to shoot myself.  But then my mind was at peace again.  I was calm.  I stayed up until I had to go to work.  I didn't come down until noon.  It had lasted 11 hours.  It was the most beautiful day of my life.  I loved everything.  I loved tussin.", "After that I knew what frying meant.  As Tyler Durdin put it in Fight Club... I just had a near-life experience.  I tripped on 4oz a few more times.  I tried 8oz once again and it wasn't all that spectacular, I just couldn't walk.  When I drank 12oz I expected to disappear for a few hours... but it didn't happen.  I think I was wanting it too much.  So Saturday night I decided to drink 16oz (1416mg of DXM) and not expect anything to happed.", "When my room was clean and I had put my mind at ease I drank the first of the 4 bottles.  My stomach is starting to protest my use of tussin so I had to drink slowly.  Two gulps and it was gone.  I went back into the living room and showed Rousey the second bottle.  He thought I was stupid to be drinking all four bottles that night, but encouraged me to do what I had to do and keep downing them.  I slammed the second bottle and almost threw up. ", "At that instance I decided to only drink 3 bottles and save the 16oz trip for another day.  I waited about 30 minutes before drinking any more.  That's when I started to feel the effects.  The third bottle took me about 5 minutes to finish.  I was beginning to trip.  I completely forgot about not wanting to drink the fourth bottle.  I grabbed it and remember turning it up to slam it, but don't remember finishing the bottle.", "I instantly disappeared.  It was about 8:30pm when I came to.  I didn't know where I was or what I was doing.  I couldn't put Robotussin and what I felt together in my mind.  I began thinking about Cody coming over later.  I was wanting him here again (I'm bi by the way).  I was talking to him in my mind.  Then on the couch, right beside me, Steve looked at me and said he was straight...  I didn't know what the hell was going on or why he was telling me that.  He was pretty fucked up to on some other drugs.", "I thought he was imagining things or talking without realizing it.  But he said I was coming on to him.  I must've been talking without my realizing.  I was talking to Cody but the only person around was Steve.  He thought I was making a pass at him.  I somehow explained that I wasn't talking to him and then time completely stopped.  He and I both disappeared into our own little worlds.  The hands on the clock didn't move for what seemed like 4 hours or more.  The room kept changing size.  Everything was distorted.  I couldn't move.  I tried moving my hand, but it was frozen in front of my face.  I felt weightless.  I felt like I was dead.", "Sometime later (probably just a few seconds later) I could hear the clock ticking like my ear was right up next to it... it was 15 feet away from me on another wall and there was loud music everywhere.  I was in a trance, completely enveloped by the experience.  I forgot about everything and everybody around me.  I could hear music coming from Kevin's room and everytime a song stopped I felt like I died, and everytime the euphoria began again I was reborn.  Flowers don't get that beautiful.  I was in heaven.", "After an hour finally passed Kevin came in the living room to talk to me.  I couldn't understand a word he was saying.  I was trying to explain what happened between me and Steve, but the words wouldn't come out.  I just heard my own voice mumbling something incoherent.  I gave up trying to talk and just went back to enjoying what was going on around me.  My house wasn't even my house anymore.  The clock was in my face and the house only consisted of the living room and Kevin's room.  My room was a house standing far off in the distance.  I finally worked up the energy to make my way there.  Imagine Dustin Hoffman in Rainman.  My arms were froze up in a fetal position and my legs were wooden beams below me.", "I felt like a robot.  My body didn't want to move like I wanted it to.  I began to wonder if I'd gotten myself in too deep.  But I convinced myself that no matter how rough it gets I've done this before.  I was struggling with my own mind.  It took all I had not to freak out.  I kept lapsing in and out of this world.  Things kept disappearing.  And that's not to mention the tracers I was having.  My entire field of vision kept following itself and turning inside out and upside down.  I walked forever and finally ended up in my room.  Kevin was in there listening to the music on my computer.  I couldn't even hear it.  I collapsed on the couch.  And that's where I began experiencing events at alternate times.", "Three events are stuck in my memory from there on out.  And bits and pieces of them happened at intermittent times.  Part of this one, part of that one, then back to the first.  It was really screwing with me.  I was time traveling the space of an hour in 5 minute chunks.", "Talking to everyone the next day I was able to figure out what happened first, second and third.  First an old friend from highschool came by, Bryan.  I hadn't talked to him in quite sometime.  While he talked I tried to pay attention, but it seemed like everytime he said something I would think about it for only a moment and then forget who was even in my room.  I couldn't see his face at all.  I had two lights on in my room, a green one hung from the ceiling and a red one in a lamp.  With both of them on it is still dark in my room.  When Bryan was there, though, it looked like the sun was inside my room.  It was so bright.", "Then Cody finally showed up right after Bryan left.  He stayed in my room for quite some time.  We layed in bed together holding hands.  He helped me light a cigarette, but I didn't even recognize my own hand in front of my face.  I couldn't feel my body at all.  I slipped into another trance.  I was a two-dimensional ribbon of life stretching from my room to my job.  I began to wig a little.  I was worried about the next day.  I knew I didn't have to work, but I was still worried about work.  I wasn't comfortable with my job yet.", "Set and setting are definitely important when frying.  I also began to get anxious about the people in my house.  I wished I had waited to trip this hard when I was more comfortable with my immediate surroundings.  I blanked out completely.", "When I came two I was only aware of three things.  Everything existed in my mind.  I was a big metal box.  And the bottles of tussin were little robots running around inside my body fucking me up.  I had no grasp on reality.  I had no grasp on anything.  I was just along for my own ride.  I was wigging hard.  Cody was beside me again.  His face was a total shock to me.  I didn't know what a human was.  All I could focus on were his eyes.  And they definitely did not cohere with my little world...  I was very FUCKED up!", "The third even was that I stood up and Cody and Bryan were both beside me (which was impossible since one left before the other showed up).  People were only two feet high and the ceiling was only three.  Everything was shrunk.  I walked into the living room and appearently made everyone in there laugh.  I couldn't understand a single word they were saying.  I didn't recognize anyone as even being real.  I just couldn't understand.  So I went back into my room and laid back down in bed and looked around.  Everything was very dark again.  No color at all.", "I could see the glow from the lights, but they weren't lighting anything up.  The walls had brush strokes like they were painted in really thing oil paints.  And EVERYTHING was gray.  I wanted to sober up and get back up to join the party.  I was feeling sick because I couldn't.  Cody was beside me again.  I didn't know what he was.  Nothing fit the little world I was in.  The last time I looked at the clock it was only 11:00pm.  It felt like days had gone by.", "I woke up on my couch around 5:30am.  I could comprehend time again.  But I was still tripping hard.  I didn't know how I got on my couch or what I had done to make me this fucked up.  I knew I had drank some Robotussin, but I couldn't figure out how it could make  me feel like this.  There was no correlation.  I fried for the next 5 hours.  I can't even remember what I saw.", "When I finally got up I saw a note from Bryan with his pager number and message that said 'Man you are FUCKED UP!!  haha.'  It was 10:30am and I went into the living room to see who was still there.  Almost everyone was, and they were just waking up.  I sat around trying to convey what happened the night before, but it was still like a dream to me.  I began drinking around 2pm and finally came down off of the tussin around 4:30.  It lasted 22 hours.", "It's been a week since it happened and I'm still somewhat shook up from it, but overall I enjoyed it.  I would just suggest being in a VERY comfortable place both physically and mentally when frying that hard.  It's scarry, but it's a wonderful place to be if you can stay relaxed.  Another note is that this isn't the drug to use at high doses if you want to be involved in the party going on around you.  And unless you know, and I mean KNOW, how well you can handle being alone in your own mind you might want to seriously consider a trip sitter.  They can save you from yourself faster than anything else... even if they don't exist at the time.", "DXM is a truly powerful drug.  There are aspects of it that are completely unlike LSD or PCP, etc.  There are however, some very interesting effects of coming up and down.  Setting is the most important factor in controlling these.  Pictures on the wall of actions, such as a flock of geese landing in a pond, music, nothing heavy as it can freak you out, and company, make sure you have good friends who won't freak out as that can get to you too. Make sure that you don't watch a gorey movie as you could start to think about that and anything you think about could be turned into a vivid hallucination, especially at higher doses.  ", "OK.  I'll start with my report. I bought one 4oz bottle of Robo Max. strength cough.  This has a little over 300mg of DXM I believe, it also has guifensen which can make you sick.  Upon return to my house and rooting through my cupboards, I came up with another partially full bottle and went into the living room, or the trip room as it was.", "I made sure that the CD player had some good techno, not too loud, not too fast, but a good beat to it.  I dimmed the lights, I have the wonderful reaction of pupil dilation, be sure to watch out for that if you're going to go out in public.  The first bottle went down pretty easily after about two to three shots of Schmirnoff.  The second, my dose is approximated because of the 'partially full' bottle, needed a little help.  A good idea might be to keep some Altoids near by because if you chew on about five of them, you can't taste anything for a while.  But the second was down and the vodka felt nice and warm.  I sat down and relaxed on my sofa, flipping through the channels to find something worth my time, theres never any trippy shows on when you need one...  ", "The first effect was noticed about thirty five minutes after ingestion.  My balance was slightly off and the ceiling was forming interesting black and white patterns, I have a 3D ceiling with lots of random patterns in the plaster.  This made walking around the room very interesting as everything seemed more interesting.  My mind was almost more clear, like the drug was pushing out all the dust and opening some unused area of my brain.  ", "The second effect, possibly called the first plateu (I think its supposed to be somewhere around ten times the effect of marijuana), was a dropping away of all worldly cares.  Extreme euphoria made everything O.K., but locomotion was extremely hard.  I had to crawl back to the couch.  Anything over 300 mg might be impossible to do out in public.  ", "The third, and expected, effect occured about an hour after ingestion.  I glanced up towards the ceiling and almost hit my head on it, well, it looked like it was just inches from my face.  The picture on the wall, a flock of ducks instead of geese that were landing in a reed surrounded pond, and I mean that they were at that moment landing, swimming out of sight and coming around for another splash landing.  This was possibly the most interesting thing I noticed.", "During the hallucinatory part, my sense of hearing seemed to come and go.  I would notice that there was music playing, but forget about it moments later.  The same for the TV.  I would look at it and see a black screen, then suddenly, the show would be back, until I lost interest and it turned back into a black screen.  ", "The biggest error I have ever done while tripping, is not locking my two cats in another room.  One of them sleeps on the couch and although seeing him there was only mildly interesting, when he yawned, I had to fight to keep control of the trip.  Seeing his teeth had a terrifying effect on me even though I understood that it was just a yawn.", "Control regained, and the effects wearing off, I tried to go to sleep.  I think I fell asleep about five-thirty am, ingestion was at eleven-thirty, and awoke to my alarm clock at eight-thirty.  The ceiling was still only inches away from my face, but no other serious hallucinations were experienced.  Although walking still had a trick to it, it was almost fun just to take a few steps in one direction and then in another.  Footfalls both before and after the hallucinations were slightly set apart from the actual placement of the foot on the ground, I felt it after I knew I should have.  Ther were no long lasting effects, but I became very tired at the end of the day.  Upon awakening I felt no traces of being tired, possibly due to the continued presence of DXM in my system.", "I must conlude that DXM is a very 'heavy' trip.  Although lower doses could be good for ametures, I must say that higher doses should be stayed away from if you don't know what to expect or how to control yourself.  The best part is, its legal, which DOES NOT MAKE IT SAFE, but does make the procurement slightly easier.  Just be sure that there are  no other active ingredients, or make Agent Lemon (extracted DXM from Robotussin).  Its not the DXM thats so terribly dangerous, its that acitominiphen and antihistamines, yes I know there's a whole lot more, are very dangerous in large quantities.  So do your research before you do your drugs!!", "I normally take Robitussin maximum strength cough and take at least 8 ounces.  The stuff messes me up real good.  But its not the initial experience that I love about Dxm its the after affects.  I've been so chilled out lately.  I'm no longer depressed and mean to everyone.  I love my life and am able to supress my desire to take more Dxm.  I now take it just to add some excitement to my life, before it removed my depression.  I dont encourage it for everyone but I gotta say that if youve lived an unhappy well being for a long time you gotta try it.  It may work for you cuz it worked for me and all of my friends.", "2. Comfort and a sense of purpose and place in the universe.", "5. More accurate perception of personality and self.", "Tussin teaches that 'it's all in the mind' and that we choose positivity through taking action and through mind control.", "Treat the event as a ritual and only perform when called by it.", "2. Upbeat music with positive messages in the lyrics.  Anything from Om Records such as Mushroom Jazz, Om Lounge, San Francisco Sessions, is perfect.", "3. Water bottles. (We also like a bottle with a little cranberry juice added.) Drink plenty.", "4. Comfortable place to lie down in front of a good stereo.  Blankets, many pillows.  Or good lounge chair.", "Occasionally two nights in a row if one night's journey ends with the compelling feeling that work has been left incomplete and must be continued immediately.", "Runs in phases- After a time (varies, perhaps 1-3 months) one feels that after a series of trips a stage of work has been completed and no trips are necessary until called to it again.  Restarting happens once you lose the feeling of being centered and you feel called to it again. ", "2. To minimize discomfort of drinking we recommend having on hand cinammon Altoids, dried pinapple chunks, tea with honey and milk.", "1. Only trip with people that you would consider bonding closely with.", "3. Recommended only for mature users. Must be willing to come face to face with one's true self. We recommend Tussin use only for self-help and growth even though growth and change are usually quite uncomfortable. The reward is that each growth step is cathartic and thus exhilarating.", "Anxieties and tensions become avoidable with experience - Tussin demands obedience to its own rules. It channels me beautifully towards positivity yet it requires experience to understand what is being demanded. Tensions, discomforts and anxieties are signals for action and tell one of several  things:", "1. Something is on your mind and needs to be shared with the others present. Tussin does not allow me equivocation or ambiguity. I must discuss my issues directly without avoidance and beating around the bush.", "2. I am having irrational fears. I eventually learned that Tussin forbids stinkin thinkin and that it will lead to spontaneous understanding of the causes of irrationality.", "3. Best of all, bodily tensions can usually be turned into sheer pleasure by slowly beginning to move to the music and get the blood flowing, leading to spontaneous stretching and wiggling and eventually to dance. The more in shape I am (particularly through yoga and stretching) the more physical pleasure is experienced through dancing. Eventually, my body will beg to dance on Tussin and I must simply follow the pleasure inside the body and turn it into motion. (No rules apply to the dance - if the body feels like performing a silly walk then I go ahead and do it. Self-consciousness about movement during the dance deprives me of a beautiful, sensual experience.)", "To our amusement, we have discovered that while it is impossible to walk normally, the urge is to crawl; by all means do this - nothing should be embarrasing while tripping. My body has complete coordination if I move rythmically from one place to another as though in a dance. Thus I find a groove any time I need to change location.", "1. We recommend one 4 ounce bottle of extra strength Tussin.  This works out to 360mg. Don't forget that only the cough syrup with 1 and no more active ingredient - dextromethorphan hydrobromide - should be used.", "2. Users with anxiety problems should take 5mg of Valium or equivalent as well. This eventually becomes unnecessary.", "3. To maximize your trips you will need high grade marijuana.  (The kind that costs 4 times more) One good drag early on is more than sufficient.  Later, another drag should be used to send the trip to higher realms.  ", "4. Some light alcohol usage can enhance the effects.", "Try to spend some quiet, meditative time on each trip.  Lie down comfortably and cover eyes with a sleeping mask, sunglasses or pillows.  Total comfort is vital. For this stage some trippy music is perfect. (See our music suggestions at the end).", "Nudity feels great but be wary of being cold - it can be difficult to realize that you are cold.", "Do not fight the feeling that you are being pulled into a deeper trip.  Every level of a Tussin trip has a purpose - every single level of a Tussin trip leads me toward positivity as long as I let it. Fighting against the Tussin experience or even trying to alter it's natural course is punished by discomfort. I must trust the experience and go with it.", "We pray that you enjoy it as we do.  It has been a gift for us.", "AT ABOUT 7PM i drank a bottle of tussin max strength. i had spent alot of time investigating its effects on the web and figured id try it myself.i am very experienced with lsd/shrooms/x ect,however this was a first with dxm", "about 45 min after i drank it i got very sick, throwing up the contents of my stomach,then continuing with dry heaves...VERY PAINFUL..after this i sat down in front of the open window, due to my extreme sweating. i did at this time feel very strange,similar to me to the trip you recieve off morning glory seeds. i can pretty much say that  even though i was 'tripping'i was not feeling 'good'.", "about every 45 min for the first three hours i would get the dry heaves, along with alternating between hot and cold flashes.  I did not get to sleep until 6 am, due to stomach cramps and muscle tremors I was having.  When I did fall asleep I woke up feeling ver much hungover, groggy, uncoordinated, sick to my stomach, etc.  Just now (22 hours later) I am starting to feel better.", "I have read all the stories of people praising DXM, I may have just been the exception to the rule, but I know I will never take it again,it was  pure hell..Stick to the illegal trips.", "I recently had a DXM experience that effected me a good deal.  The names are the same, I found no reason to change them.", "Mary and I had been trying to buy some grass from a friend all afternoon, but Dan was being incredibly difficult.  After about an hour of bargaining, we decided that we weren't getting any dope from him, and so we decided to forget about it and just pick up some DXM.", "As for the setting/mood; overall, it was fairly light and happy, aside from the small anger towards Dan.  Mary had just gotten out of a long relationship which could have ended on better terms.  It is a very complicated story, not something which I really wish to recount here, but we are in love.  We have been for a month, but we have never actually expressed ourselves in more than words.  Aside from this, we  were extremely comfortable around each other, and never have had a bad time with each other.", "We ingested the Dextromethorphan around 7:00 PM, both at a mid-level second plateau dose.  I began to feel the effects as we arrived at Willie's Diner.  We were with two other people, both entirely sober, who could watch out for us if we got into trouble.  We( Mary and I) were both feeling fairly sick.  I forced myself to eat some soup and bread, which made me feel a little better.  We finished at the diner and decided to go to the park.", "We were sitting in the back seat of the car, when our two friends went for a walk.  We had been holding hands, but with the departure of our friends, it was as if a floodgate of emotions had been opened.  We didn't have to talk, we just held on.  I buried my head in her neck and she did the same to me.  I had a fever by this time, and was burning up, but the pure affection being put out by both of us was enough to soothe me.", "We held each other for what seemed like an eternity, when she climbed up on me and we kissed.  Those two minutes kissing on DXM was the most amazing experience I have ever had on this drug.  I felt as if we were connected, that we thought as one, that we no longer needed two bodies.  We let our emotions flow to each other, and as we kissed in the darkness, I knew that she loved me as much as I loved her.", "After what seemed like another eternity, we parted.  We held each other the rest of the night without saying more than a few words the whole time.", "I understand that ecstasy is something similar to this, except even better.  I'm sure that when we do E, that it will be more sensually pleasing than this was, but nothing can describe what is between us because of this experience, and nothing can change our feelings now.", "The past several days(weeks?) I had been bored and just feeling dull. I hadn't used anything else for a week or two, and bought a bottle of Robotussin Maximum Strength Cough and Cold even though I knew it was the wrong kind. The only other ingredient it had in it was guafinesin which makes you want to puke.", "I started drinking it at about 5:45 and finished almost close to 6 (get powder or do an extraction if you can). I had used DXM three times before with ok results so I didn't expect much. I started my stopwatch when I finished drinking but forgot about it by the time it hit, maybe 30 minutes later. I got a big rush of a body high at first, followed by noticing how bright all the colors were. I just sat there watching tv for a while, by now time had no meaning, before walking around. It almost felt like I was drunk, but only while moving. Kinda like every movement was magnified ALOT. I felt really detached from my body, kinda like in Being John Malkivich. You can't really describe what I felt like as third person, but my body didn't look like or feel like mine. Maybe a half hour later I closed my eyes and noticed some patterns peeling into others. After that I realized that there was a slight cross hatch pattern over my vision. This went on for the rest of night untill I went to bed.", "The next morning I woke up and felt REALLY good, it wasn't untill I was really awake and at school that I was still enough to notice the CEV's. These weren't quite as intense but they got more intense for the first couple of hours and then rapidly dispersed. This was kind of disturbing to me because we were taking some important tests. Strangely though, I answered the questions without having to actively think about it. Wandering thoughts were able to come and go without any disturbance and I still just sat there and toiled away. By night I was VERY tired and went to bed early.", "Now three days after doseing, I'm back at baseline, but still in a nice after glow. I don't think I learned anything from this experiance except that this might have been the drug used, or something similar, when the Matrix and Being John Malkavich was made. It made me realize that there is more to life than most of us want to agree. Truely this can provide a good couple of days of fun, but it is extremly strange and variable.", "Lately I've been hearing a lot about drinking cough syrup for a trip, so I decided to try it for myself. I convinced a friend to try it along with me, and we each took 480 mL in the form of Vicks 44 maximum strength, which contains DXM only. ", "Well we went for a drive to smoke a joint, not yet feeling anything. But soon after we roached it, I started to get hyper and had almost a drunk feeling. I got to the point where i didnt want to drive anymore, so we went back to his house right around dark. As soon as i got out of the truck the effects kind of hit all at once for us both, and neither one of us went inside for about 2 hours. While outside, i robo walked around the yard, each shoe felt like it wieghed 100 pounds. I jumped up on his sisters trampoline but i couldnt stand on it. I got back down and his sister and her friends pulled in. They wanted to smoke a joint so we went in and lit one up. He ran and puked after that, but I felt pretty good, just totally disoriented and almost insane. One of his sisters friends pointed out that my eyes looked 'like snake eyes', and said they were freaking her out because the pupils were so big. ", "I had an extremely drunk feeling all night, almost trippy in a way, but still no good visual or auditory hallucinations. I think this drug is worth taking if you like to get as fucked up as possible, but if you want more of a thinking mans trip go with something else, like LSD or DMT. In my opinion, DXM is an easy, inexpensive way to get a good buzz on, and i recommend it to anyone thinking about tryin it. ", "It was around 10:30 on a Friday night and my friends got me to try DXM for my first time.  I wasn't too sure if I really wanted to do it after listening to their stories, but in spite of this, I took around 500 mg.  I started watching a movie after I took it and I didn't feel anything until the movie was ending.  It felt like my body was floating and everything I said was a thought.  It wasn't much different than a beer buzz.  At that point, I felt like it wasn't going to get much better so I laid down on the couch.  My friends put green lightbulbs in every socket because it was supposed to enhance the trip.", "I waited forever, then finally it hit me all at once.  It was the most alien experience in my life.  Every movement I made gave me an incredible rush so I went outside and rolled in the grass.  After a couple minutes of that, I felt like I could no longer stand being on my feet so once again I retired to the couch.", "When I got back, that's when I realized that time was going by slower than usual. I had only been outside for three minutes but it felt like a good half hour. Everyone else was sleeping so I stayed up with the green lights.  I had the feeling like I wasn't awake but I could see everything around me.  I stood up to get a watch to see what time it was but only minutes had passed since the last time I checked.  When I walked, my body didn't move like I wanted it to.  I fell a couple times face first into the floor but didn't feel it.  I went to the couch my friend was on and tried to wake him up because I thought I was going crazy and I needed someone to talk to.  He looked really strange and he had a third eye between his eyebrows.  It scared the shit out of me so I woke him up, but the eye didn't go away.  It would blink and look around just like his real eyes.  I talked to him and preached about things I never knew existed until that night.  He fell asleep during this and I paced back and forth through the room for hours on end, looking at the room I knew so well, but still it seemed like it was in an alternate dimension.  I did this until I feel asleep.", "After doing all the research I could on DXM, most of it here on Erowid, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try.  We brought home 2 bottles of cough syrup, but decided to split one since it was our first time.  I plugged my nose and downed the thick red stuff as fast as I could.  When I was done, all I could think about was 'Wow, there's no turning back now!'", "For the first little while, there was nothing.  Then, in small but steady waves, the disorientation began to take hold.  I started feeling really out of my head by the one hour mark and Pink Floyd was playing on the stereo.  It all started to get overwhelming and I had to turn the music off.  Sweat started pouring down my face and I could feel my mind begin to slip away.  No matter what position I sat in, I couldn't get comfortable and my skin tingled like crazy.", "I tried smoking some grass, but after the first toke, a strong and terrifying nausea gripped hold of me and I had to run to the bathroom.  After puking twice, the diarrhea set in and I stayed in the bathroom for almost two hours, alternating between shitting and puking, although the only thing I was expelling by then was water.", "The dehydration was awful, but I couldn't seem to hold down any water.  I would have killed my own mother for an IV.  I crawled back into the living room, nursing my water bottle, taking the occasional sip.  The TV was on, but I was too lost in DXM land to notice or care.  If I hadn't felt so sick and weak, I probably would have enjoyed the feeling.  I thought I was dying for awhile, and I was lost in some deep dark void for the rest of the trip, yet I was just feeling too awful to enjoy any of it.", "The next day, I stayed home from university to recover and hydrate.", "The whole experience felt like the flu on Mescaline and was an overall negative experience.  On the other hand, besides the Robo Itch, my girlfriend had a great time and wants to do it again someday.  She didn't feel sick at all.", "What I've learned from all of this is that DXM has three possible outcomes.  Really Good, So/So, or REALLY BAD!  How it will affect you cannot be predicted, so know that you've got a 33% chance of getting really sick, rapidly dehydrating and having a miserable time before you decide that DXM might be a good idea.  Then again, you have the same chance of having a really GOOD time, so don't let anyone else tell you what your experience is going to be like.  You'll have to find out on your own.", "All I can say is WOW. This was the single most enlightening, pleasant, and mind altering experience of my life.  I should point out that I am not taking any perscription drugs, and I have a very nice life right now. I am generally a very happy person.  For me, mood has a lot to do with this drug.", "I bought a 4 oz bottle of Robitussin maximum strength cough syrup at a grocery store (got a few stares from the checkout person and a sarcastic comment 'got a big cold, huh...') and made plans to use it that night. I was alone, but in a comfortable setting. The taste is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. I mixed it with a little water to thin it out and then just downed a carefully measured 3 and a half tablespoons. After ten minutes I decided I didn't just want a buzz, I wanted an experience, so I just drank the rest of the bottle. I tried not to become obsessed with the effects setting in by just watching some tv. ", "0:40 - I began to feel kind of dizzy (in a very good way) and euphoric, like I had just had 4 or 5 beers only without the 'boozy' feeling. I was really getting into it and i was already satisfied.", "1:00 - Now it was really setting in. I had read that it peaked after 2 or 3 hours, so I figured I had a ways to go. My whole head started to itch, as well as my hands. It was very annoying but only lasted a few minutes.", "1:30 - By now I was feeling like I had had more than a few drinks, and had also smoked a bowl. This was such a great feeling. Every once in a while I would stand up and things would go crazy, my head felt like it was floating 10 feet above my body, my arms felt very light, and objects kept going in and out of focus. My vision was a bit blurry and it was very hard to concentrate, but I managed to put in a cd. Music was wonderful, the bass seemed to enter my body and linger for a few seconds, like my head was a huge echo chamber.", "2:00 - Now I was completely incapacitated. I could barely walk, let alone stand up, without falling over and laughing at myself hysterically. I somehow made my way upstairs and to my bed, but I don't remember how. I would mutter things to myself and talk to the walls because I thought they were mocking me in some way, but at the same time they were very friendly and we could laugh together. I couldn't read any text, it all appeared as incoherent rambling, as did the people on tv. I put on another cd and laid down with headphones. Closing my eyes I started to see incredible visuals, colorful and strange things, not at all like the effects of acid or shrooms. This was very pleasurable and I was really getting into it. I let the music run and I fell into a sort of trance, I was awake, but I was not in my body. I was somewhere else entirely, and I have only vague recollections of what happened. My trance-like state lasted about 4 hours.", "6:00 - I managed to sort of wake myself up, and I was instantly aware of my surroundings and everything that had happened. I sat up and noticed I was still under the effects, only not as strong as hours before. It was very hard to make it down to the kitchen to get some water because I was bumping into everything on my way, but I made it safely and back to my bed. From there, I just slept for about 9 hours and woke up feeling very refreshed with the whole experience still fresh in my mind. ", "This was an amazing experience, I found it somewhat spiritual, but at the same time very entertaining and fun. I plan on trying this again, maybe with a few friends and a *slightly* higher dose. I plan on waiting a few weeks because I want to keep the dose rather low until I'm comfortable with it. I'd prefer not taking any other mainstream drugs with dxm (such as mj). I felt many of the cannabis-like effects with the dxm, closed eye hallucinations, sensations like I was flying or falling, and the same kind of mental state at the beginning of the trip.", "DXM is the most powerful, profound and scary drug I have ever done. It is definitely not for the faint of heart or weak of mind. I've learned to take responsibility for my indulgences, and I was prepared to take responsibility for that night.", "I researched DXM trips for awhile before making my first batch using the 'Agent Lemon' method. It's cheap, the ingredients are easy to find, and most importantly, the theory and procedure were very simple after some experience in the Organic Chem. lab. On our first trip we split a weak batch of 1,000 mg four ways. We thought a tiny taste should suffice our first time (to test the safety of my extraction). We experienced mild disassociation and didn't die... so we decided to take the plunge the following weekend.  ", "I produced 2/3 gallon of extra pure 'DXemonade' (mixed with lemon juice) using 6 8oz bottles of Tussin Maximum Strength (700 mg/bottle w/no other actives). I was very careful to liberally estimate my percent yield, to help avoid an overdose when pouring out our portions. On Saturday evening, we had 6 doses of 550-650 mg each (concentrated to about 1.25 cups each). Each dose was added to a large glass of grapefruit juice (after adjusting our doses according to body weight), mixed our cocktails and drank up.", "After one hour, we all began to feel drunk/stoned and had trouble walking. My stomach was upset from all the tart grapefruit juice and lemon juice, but I was too anxious to care. I decided to read other psychnauts' DXM accounts on the Internet, but as soon as I got onto the web, my eyes failed me. I couldn't read the words. I soon lost interest in the screen, lay in my dark room with 2 friends, and had my first out of body experience.", "It was tunnel vision in the literal sense. That within my field of view existed, and nothing peripheral did. I had no concept of right, left, up or down. Anything or anyone in my sight path became the whole focus of my being, a puzzle to be worked out. I lost control of my legs, arms and reflexes. The wave hit me so fast that I immediately assumed that I had overdosed. I had read how dangerous 4th plateau trips can be and decided that I needed more babysitters. I tried to go out in the living room. Gravity increased in strength and my legs felt weighed down.", "Most of my friends were as useless as I was, so I was not to be cheered up by them. I was no longer in control of my body, which then stumbled out onto the porch and lit a cigarette. The smoking made me ill, and I was sweating bullets, so I decided to take a cold shower. Instead, I sat on the edge of the tub and marveled at the toilet, wanting to throw up. The toilet waited patiently, like a sea creature, for me to lean over so it could gobble me up. My friend L then came in to rescue me. I ranted confusedly that the world was ending and that I would die 'tonight'. L wasn't as bad off as I, he understood that I was ragingly paranoid. So he sat with me trying to help me calm down. Suddenly, every emotion of which I am capable rushed through me. I was terrified, but excited. I laughed uncontrollably with tears in my eyes. Then I puked.", "The paranoia immediately lifted. I knew that I would no longer die tonight because the (very little) DXM left unabsorbed in my stomach was gone now. I didn't feel nauseous anymore, but I was very claustraphobic. L and another friend took me out for a walk. The cool summer night rejuvenated me. I began to enjoy my tunnel vision more. The outer stairway was a momentous challenge. I took a couple of minutes, but I mastered the daunting distance of one flight by crawling down backwards on all fours.", "We took long walk around the apartment grounds. At certain times, balance would become difficult (especially in grassy areas), and I would drop to all fours again to walk. This earned me the nickname 'DXM Monkey'. When I walked, it was like gliding. I took long exaggerated, steps which allowed me to see my feet (out in front of me) and remind me that I wasn't flying. I spoke about senseless things, mumbling to myself and my friends for the whole duration. People we passed along the way probably feared me, but I didn't care unless they were standing right in front of me.", "My vision shifted like slowly advancing frames of a film. I focused on an object, becoming one with it, until I had successfully circumvented it. Then I found another one to guide me. The decision not to drive was never a problem because it never even occured to us to go somewhere else. The apartment courtyard was a big enough puzzle to master. We went for several 'nature walks' that night, and often ended up camped out in the courtyard again to watch an ongoing night game of sand volleyball played by our neighbors. Seven psychonauts, all completely twisted, sat in the middle of the lawn, smoking cigarettes and staring at the volleyball court.", "The rest of the night seemed like a cocktail party. Everybody was loud and busy-playing music, making phone calls, chain smoking on the balcony and talking about our trip. It was the cleanest high I've ever felt. I was pleasantly insane for 6 hours (which took an eternity to pass). There was no waiting impatiently for the comedown, like on LSD. At first, the DXM got right on top of me, but I eventually took control of my (distant) body (or 'took the reins', as we now call it) and had a great time. DXM is by no means a rave or dance drug, but it worked very well for a tame night at home with friends. ", "The walk through the Nature Tunnel is something I will probably repeat, but I will watch my dosage very closely in the future. We reached the 3rd plateau, and it almost overwhelmed me. I fear what I would find at the 4th.", "I had read and heard about DXM for years and really wanted to try it.  But I knew that me drinking a bottle of Robo wasn't going to happen.  I kept searching for DXM only pills.  Of course, they are very hard to come by, in the United States.  I had more or less given up until a few months ago when I found a product called 'DexAlone' at a small independent pharmacy, more or less by accident.  ", "The only active ingredient in 'DexAlone' is dextromethorphan hydrobromide (30 mg per gelcap).  There are about 9 inactive ingredients.", "I tried it early one morning (around 6am), after I had been up all night.  I did not have anything else in my system.  I took 12 gelcaps, on an empty stomach.  I broke about 3 of the gelcaps open before swallowing.  By the way, these pills were HUGE.  Don't expect to swallow them without water.  Based on the info I had on DXM, I was shooting for a 2nd plateau experience.", "Within 30 - 40 minutes, my computer screen started to take a gel like appearance with wavy lines flowing down it.  (I had very similar visuals once on Benadryl.)", "I also, started to get a very 'heavy' feeling and room size was out of whack.  I also started to get VERY bad nausea.  I went to the bathroom and dry heeved several times but nothing came up.  Quickly after, the nausea passed, and for the first and only time during the experience I felt good.  It was not euphoria (believe me I have experienced euphoria and this wasn't close) or even a high.  It just felt 'better' than a few minutes before.", "At this point, I lost track of time, so forgive me for not being able to give you a running clock.  I got into the shower to relax.  My body became extremely heavy, so I had to sit in the shower rather than stand.  How I felt was unlike any feeling I had ever had before.  It wasn't good mind you, just different.  ", "I closed my eyes and I was at work.  It wasn't an hallucination per se but more like a lucid dream (something I have had quite a few of since childhood).  If I opened my eyes the visuals would stop but the second I closed them, I would be back at work.  In fact, I even had sex with a co-worker in my visuals, although I was 100% flacid in reality.  DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE SEX WHILE ON DXM, FOLKS !!! :-)", "I felt like I weighed 700 lbs.  Any movement on my part required concious effort.  Finally I got out of the shower, which took a lot of effort physically.  Before, I went to my bedroom though, I had to take a very bad crap.  Apparently, DXM causes upset stomachs.  When I was done I headed to my bedroom.  Although it was hard to tell, I believe that I had a 'Robo-Walk'.  Gravity was totally messed up.", "After a certain point I do not remember walking anymore but rather seeing and jumping thru a cartoon-like 'warp tunnel'.  Something like a worm hole in Star Trek and it transporting me to my bedroom.", "In my bedroom, I became very dizzy and had to lay down.  The whole room was spinning.  I closed my eyes and my bed was still spinning.  Within seconds I was laying on my bed spinning thru outer space.  I could see stars, galaxies, comets, etc.", "I ended up having all sorts of visuals (or maybe lucid dreams, I really don't know) about friends, work, life.  I don't even remember all of them.  The weird thing about it was the cartoon like quality of many of the visuals.  Many visuals were as clear and real, as everyday life, while others looked like something out of a Saturday morning cartoon.  Some were even mixed with realistic visuals.", "At some point, I got back up and I was in a very DXM state.  I had no depth perception.  My side vision was gone.  And I could not seem to focus.  I also had the weird strobe effect with my vision.  Kind of like watching an old time movie.", "I tried to sit down and read some DXM articles on Erowid but my eyes couldn't focus, so it was hard to read.  I tried websurfing and had the same problem.  So I gave up on the computer.", "I put in a CD and listened to some music hoping the the quality would be enhanced but it was the opposite.  Music was totally uninteresting.  I tried a couple music genres and all were equally uninteresting.", "I tried watching TV everything on was boring to watch.  I even tried some DVD's that I love normally and they were equally boring.", "During all this, I had Howard Stern on the radio.  Even though, I could not get into him while on DXM, hearing his voice was reassuring because I knew that I had not lost touch with this world.", "I tried eating chips and drinking soda and I discovered that I had NO taste whatsoever.", "Physically and mentally I did not feel good.  It is hard to pinpoint what did not feel right, though.  To be honest, I felt horrible.  ", "My mind felt totally disassociated with my body.  I could think clearly and logically.  But my body was just not working right or in unison with my mind.  I would try to talk but only nonsense would come out.  Even though I knew the experience would end, I had a nagging dread that it wouldn't and I would be stuck in this state forever.  I also felt very hot like I had a fever and a very bad headache would come and go.", "At times I even felt like I had died and that I was a spirit returning to earth.  Or maybe more of a person who just died and their spirit had not gone to heaven yet.", "Other than a few rather mild open-eyed visuals such as a lit light bulb looking like a flame, there was not a whole lot of open eyed visuals.  I managed to have a few closed eyed visuals but mostly it was lucid like dreams that I experienced.", "I finally laid down and went to sleep.  When I woke up around 2pm I was completely sober and experienced no hangover whatsoever.  I did not seem to experience any ill effects on my body.", "DXM is not fun and is basically garbage in my opinion.  I never felt good.  I refuse to use the word 'trip' in regards to DXM because believe me, DXM is not a trip in the true sense.  I'll admit that the lucid visuals were interesting but were not worth the nausea, horrible feelings, and possible danger involved.", "My recommendation is that if you have not tried DXM - DON'T.", "This is all true, why/how would I make something like this up ?", "I'm writing this to share information about DXM Overdose, what its like, what it does to you, and my personal overdose experience. I really hope for this to be of use to someone. At the time of this writing it is 17 days after my overdose and my brain is still *extremely* fuzzy, its hard to think, my stomach is always messed up, I get motion/car sickness, and mild claustrophobia that I *never* had before.", "I'm going to start at the beginning of the day rather than the crucial dose since it all ties together. My friend Nick (19/m) and I had much pure DXM put into capsules (250mg in each capsule). At the beginning of the day I went to where Nick was staying, which was my cousins (Brandy 21/f) and her husbands (Eddy 20/m) house. Tammy (My Aunt, Brandy's mother) was there also. They have a baby of 8 months (Brandon). At the time I arrived it was around 7am and Eddy was at work (which was good). Brandy, Tammy, and Nick decide to go to our friend Mondayes cause she lives by the beach, so I tagged along. We went to the beach and hung for a while then headed back to Mondayes place.", "At this time Nick doses without my knowledge 1 250mg capsule. Brandy, Mondaye and I head out to get some pizza, 30 minuets or so we return to Mondayes place. By this time Nick is starting to feel the effects of the DXM and tells me he dosed. I'm like 'you dosed? Damn I thought we were gonna wait till later in the day man!' At this time it's only like 11:30am. So I decide to dose as well since he did. I take 2 250mg capsules (500mg) being a more frequent (experienced) DXM user than him.", "Tammy brings up my last DXM experience that she happened to be around for (1000mg) and starts telling how fucked up I was and some of the things I did/said, so we talk about that for a while (I admit it was amusing). About this time I decide to eat a piece of pizza. (12:00) I'm starting to feel the effects of the DXM and Nick is already starting to trip. I lay on Mondayes couch for a while, while they're outside talking.", "Right before we leave I'm starting to trip and decide to take another 250mg capsule (bringing me to 750mg) from this point on event become hazy? We return to Brandy's apartment and I'm tripping rather nicely (rather hard) and Nick finds the effects to be overwhelming for a while, and lays on the bathroom floor. Oh by the way he took another one when I did (bringing him to 500mg) He makes note of how much harder/stronger the pure shit hits you than cough syrup.", "I talk to him for a while trying to get him through it and at this time I decide to take another (about 3:00pm probably, bringing me to 1000mg) From this point on everything is really a blur? I remember laying down a lot on the bed in the babies' room while Nick lay on the floor and we talked about the trip etc away from the rest of the people (Tammy had left) I'm having an unusually strong trip due to the drawn out-ness of the dosing. I'm having a lot more confusion than I normally would at this dose. Once I start peaking and the trip steadies out, we go out to join Brandy. At this time my judgement and logical thought have completely diminished in a way it never had before.", "I remember watching Brandon (the baby) play. I played some music and danced around like a fool for a while. (It's getting hard for me to sequence events) From what they told me I could barely talk, what I would say would come out as 'bwalwayamawasa' and stuff. Everything was just like a dream at this point and I kept going into trances. At some point Brandy had taken the DXM from me (in attempt to cut me off) when I realized this I became somewhat furious.", "Keep in mind this was like no ordinary DXM trip for some reason. I wasn?t myself. I tried to get the DXM back off of Brandy (I failed) and she left for work. At some point Tammy had returned (mad at me) and I couldn?t understand why and it was ruining my trip cause that?s all I could think about. I tried to talk to her (which made things worse) I guess after this I went back to the babies room and laid down for a while. Then I came back out and Tammy and Nick were talking. OH Mondaye was still there. Uhm? Anyway I'll just skip to an important event.", "I remember trying to eat a bowl of Trix (which was nearly impossible) while Nick (still tripping balls) was talking to Tammy. These events aren't important so I'll skip ahead. At some point I had taken another (bringing me to 1250mg) which I don?t remember, but Nick said I did so I belive him.", "Around 7:30pm I'm returning to reality. So is Nick. But I'm still tripping pretty hard. I for some reason wanted to return where I was(the state of mind). Nick said he wanted to re-dose and go to the mall. I loved the plan! So I had at some point gotten more of the DXM from somewhere. Nick wanted 1 so I give it to him (bringing him to 750mg he has taken) I took 3 more!", "Judgement being completely fuct, I came to the conclusion that since I was coming down it would be o.k. (I think that musta been it) So we decide to walk to the mall. I remember about 10 minuets of this walk. I remember spinning around in circles on the sidewalk and walking all over the place and Nick would be like 'this way!!' (after this point anything I remember is in 5 second clips) Next thing I remember is walking through the door of the mall. Then lying on the floor in the music store. Then in the middle of the mall I couldn?t stand so I decided to sit down (The End) this must have been when I reached the anesthetic (dangerous) state/dose of DXM. Just blankness, I was just 'out'.", "Next thing I 'remember' is sitting on the floor next to a paramedic. (apparently this is right after they shot something into my arm that my friend said like 'reanimated me' (maybe adrenaline) This is just really really eerie from this point on? STRANGE DERANGED and shit. Just how I was 'thinking' My brain was like making up scenarios of what was going on or something. Thinking like why am I here?", "I was in like alternate dimension. Just thinking and trying to remember what it was like is like oh my god. This is getting really hard? This was like traumatic and thinking about it is fuct. But anyway. I remember that, 5 seconds of being in the ambulance. 5 seconds of being strapped down to a hospital bed with an IV in my arm and 3 doctors looking down at me. Then coming back to consciousness for the 1st time more than 5 seconds.", "This is where my brain was working really wacky. I was looking at the ceiling for a long ass time. Trying to figure out where I was. When I finally realized where I was I tried to figure out why. I had no idea that I had overdosed. Basically I thought I was kidnapped by an evil force of some kind and having mental tests conducted on me. I couldn?t move very much. After like 20 minuets of lying there not moving I attempted to move. I realized I was strapped down, and tried to get up. A doctor came in and said 'Mr. Wetzel' (my name) and the struggling must have worn me out so I went back out.", "I cant stress how out of this world it was. I felt this pain? that wasn?t really pain. I guess I was so dissociated I could feel the pain I was having. They had pumped my stomach, pumped me full of activated charcoal, catheterized me!!!! And I was on an IV. I guess some time that night (around 11 or 12 or something) Tammy, Brandy, Eddy, Clark, and Nick came to see me. (I don?t remember this) Apparently I was raging and delerious 'cause I was yelling and cussing a lot (from what they told me) and I showed everyone the tube they put in my dick. I woke up the next morning around 12 and asked a nurse why I was there, she explained? I remained in the hospital for 2 days and then was transferred to a mental hospital cause they thought I was suicidal(thought I intentionally overdosed) I don?t care to discuss much more but it was hell.", "I guess the DXM caused hypercardia something or other. Which means my heart was going dangerously fast, my heart rate was 170 something (90 being normal). Which would have caused me to die if they hadn't given me whatever drugs they gave me to calm it down. And I had an extremely high fever of  109F, which the combination of that and the DXM caused a lot of brain cells to die. Also extremely high blood pressure.", "[erowid note: Very high fevers like this can cause death & organ damage very quickly.]", "Brain damage? Apparently. the combination of the fever and the DXM. It is extremely hard for me to think/concentrate now. Recalling memories is hard. Extremely short attention span. Even worse memory than I had. And some whacked out shit. I get these extremely sick feeling like I'm going to die or something. My stomach cramps and pains. I get motion sick and claustrophobic (I have tried to avoid riding in a car) extremely sensitive to heat (I get sick and cant think at all if its to warm in here) digestion problems. Etc. None of which I had before the overdose. NONE. Basically my life is shit now (thank god I make my living from the internet) I have noticed slowly regaining some things. But some I can tell will be permanent, (e.g. my stomach is getting better, and less sickness, but my brain is still just as fucked up) ", "Be careful people don?t over do it. If you plan to take high doses of DXM, make a limit, and hide the rest.", "Please, do not experiment with DXM. Its a fun (and interesting) experience, BUT NOT WORTH IT. Trust me...", "My experience started on new years eve 2000 (we were entering 2001)... I had done DXM before, but the previous 2 times I had split the bottle with another friend (usually letting him have more than me). Anyways, my friends and I went to Albertsons to buy some Robitussin for us early that evening. Each of us drank a bottle around 8:00 pm and were definately feeling the effects by 10:00 pm when we got out of the Spa. The trip lasted well into the night and when I ended up going to bed at about 1:45 the next morning I was still feeling it. The next day I felt drained of energy, the next day I was feeling better, and the next day I started to realize that DXM had attacked my thought processes.", "A DXM trip is like being really stoned (the 'slow motion' effect), really drunk (the 'no balance' effect), and has a noticable body high. Oh yes, and my vision is FLAT and many times I will think that an object is something that is really not. Its not halucinations, but my mind definitely wanders and feels out of place. What ever I are focusing on with my eyes is 'outlined' in a way and everything else around it is flat. Don't get me wrong, the DXM experience was very fun at the time (example: my friends and I sat in a VAN for 45 minutes just laughing and watching the neighbors kids ride around on their Razor Scooters), BUT, it was NOT WORTH the after effects! If I could trade in that new years eve for a boring new years eve with out DXM ever involved, I WOULD.", "The next month or two (and even now but nearly to the extent as earlier), my brain would not function correctly. Thinking of the right word to fit into a sentence was difficult, I find myself slightly dyslexic, memories I know I should have are not easily recalled, and I generally feel like I am considerably more stupid than I was before I made the decision to pound that bottle of Robo.", "I'll start by giving a bit of information on myself and my experiences.  I'm a fairly ordinary college guy and I've done my share of drugs, but I'm far from what you might consider an 'experienced' user.  I've tried cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, marijuana, and of course DXM.  The only things I do regularly (meaning on the weekends, at parties, et cetera) are marijuana and alcohol.  DXM is something I'm fairly new to.", "Of all the drug-induced experiences I've ever had, the most positive have come from DXM in low dosages.  I never enjoyed getting drunk to the point where I blacked out or smoking herb to where I could hardly even move.  For me the most positive effects of a drug are not the physical feeling of being 'messed up'.  This is why DXM appeals to me.", "DXM doesn't make me feel 'high', physically.  In fact, it's often difficult to tell if I'm still feeling the effects of DXM.  It produces a slight feeling of dizziness or disorientation.  The real effects of DXM at this dosage are psychological.  I've found it altogether impossible to feel hostility, frustration, anger, or boredom while using DXM.  Aside from this altered state of mind there is little indication that I'm still under the effects of the drug (dialated pupils and slight disorientation/dizziness are all I've noticed).  It's nowhere near as intense in physical feeling (impairment) as even marijuana or alcohol.", "The lack of these feelings doesn't begin to describe the effects of DXM, however.  On DXM life is good, people are understanding, and I have a general feeling that everything is as it should be.  It's similar to ecstasy in that I feel that things in general are really good, but the empathy toward other people is even deeper (I felt a distinct difference between DXM and ecstasy in that my feelings on X were less empathetic and more self-centered).  It has completely changed my relationship with the friends I've done the drug with.  We connected through the use of DXM one night, analyzed ourselves, and came to the realization that we were really not very nice to each other.  Since that time we have been much less critical of each other.  It's truly amazing to me.", "There is also a feeling of understanding toward my environment.  For instance, walking through a forest on a sunny afternoon could be described as pleasant by most.  But on DXM it's something more.  The birds chirping, the sun filtered down through the leaves overhead, the earthy smell, a light breeze; all of these things are much more noticable.  Normally these things cannot truly be appreciated because they are ordinary.  With DXM nothing is simply ordinary.  Everything is 'good' and, well, extraordinary in it's own way.  ", "My latest DXM experience was a hike through the forest for 6 hours on a sunny afternoon with a few friends.  There was not a moment of boredom.  At no point do we feel like we were wasting time or that something else might be more entertaining.  Our entire afternoon consisted of wandering around, stopping to sit and listen, and then wandering to another point.  And by the end of the day we all felt very upbeat.  It was as if we had spent that entire afternoon doing something worthwhile and feeling completely content.", "Don't do DXM with antidepressants.  If you survive it could still be a very unpleasant experience.", "Don't mix DXM with marijuana, alcohol, or other drugs.  Drug interactions and overdoses are something to worry about here.  Marijuana won't hurt you any, but it will produce a completely different effect than DXM by itself.  It's fun, but in my opinion DXM by itself is a better experience.", "DXM impairs my judgement somewhat.  I imagine the higher the dosage the greater this effect.", "This is the real deal folks. Eat light, but not too light. This buzz will last between 5 - 8 hours (estimated 1 hour per ounce consumed). Chug 8 oz. (in touch with god, very strong buzz), 6 oz. (feeling extremely happy with hallucinations) or 4 oz. (continual buzz) and not less than 4 oz. Chug it!!! Then finish it off with a big glass of water to get the horrible taste out of your mouth. Then, do not eat or drink anything else for about an hour. This would be a great time to watch a movie or something. During this hour you may feel a bit queezy and dizzy. Right before you feel really sick (if you can last 1 and 1/2  hours), smoke a fatty. Then you are off on a psychedelic journey. Be sure to have good music on and visuals - i recomment The Orb (Advertures Beyond the Ultraworld) or Orbital or any techno music. Another great visual is Minds Eye or Virtual Nature (with the other music as background). Sit back, Relax and Enjoy the buzz!", "I've taken many hallucinogens in the past and have always caught crazy visuals.  I've eaten a lot of acid at high doses in the past.  I tried DXM for the hell of it since those cold pills always gave me decent buzz whenever I was sick.  I got my hands of an oz of powered DXM for a really cheap price.  I started with 100mgs and waited a few hours and smoked some herb.  I started catching very slight visuals.  A couple days later I took 200mg and did the same and caught nicer visuals.  I kept increasing every five days or so by 100mgs.  I got up to taking 600mgs and that stuff put me on my ass without doing any other drugs.  I was so out of touch with reality and I forgot where I was.  ", "After a couple weeks of taking a break from it I introduced a friend to it.  We each took 1200mgs.  Don't ask why we took so much.  Within an hour we were blinded by all the visuals.  We smoked some herb and after that I can't remember a damn thing.  Ever since that night whenever I take any amount of DXM over 120mgs I start seeing visuals and they don't subside for about 3 days.  If this happens to anyone else please let me know.  I don't even feel a buzz from such a low dose anymore, but I see the craziest things.  Ever since taking large amounts of DXM I have been stuck with what seems like permanent visuals.  If I go outside at night and look into the semi-pitch black darkness my vision soon gets distorted and I start catching major trails followed by lots of crazy visuals.  I was just wondering if this is normal.  BTW I've been sober for over 2 months and I'm still catching these visuals that I believe were caused by DXM.", "Drank (1) 115 mL bottle Robo Honey Cough.  Severe stomach pains ($5.00 for all that honey and corn syrup!!) for about 40 minutes. Wheat Thins helped enormously with the cramps. DXM started having effects after about an hour.  I got into some of my old records (vinyl), and had a very positive experience. I'm not a musician, but I tried to follow the suggestion of 'making music' by playing DJ and recording a mix tape.  This was the second time I've tried this dose; I had planned to do more, but I just can't stomach the stuff they put in the syrup. ", "I would classify this as a nice plateau 1 experience: I had a gentle, soothing buzz that 'rolled' somewhat like E, but didn't falter.  If nothing else, I've discovered that I like 'Donovan'... Also, burned some jasmine and patchoulli incense which seemed to heighten the experience.  Stretching is also rewarding for me at this level, as is curling up on our overstuffed couch with the headphones on.  My motor actions were very deliberate. even at this low dose I would NOT consider driving or going among the 'normals'. No visuals at this dose, and I can't say this is _quite_ like anything I've tried.  It has elements of pot, heroin, ecstasy, but so far nothing like LSD, shrooms, or salvia (didn't like the last: felt like nitrous). The whole thing lasted a good 2 hours, with some time for chill down ('Scorn' or 'FSOL' worked well). Good luck, and stay safe.", "I had not yet experienced LSD, and was told by all kinds of people that 'robotripping' was, if nothing else, 'interesting.'  Well, interesting it was, but after taking LSD, I will never go back to such a dirty drug...here's what happened:", "I was at my apartment, with several friends, 3 others who were all tripping with me.  We drank the bottles (which was the worst tasting substance I have ever had to take) and felt kinda sick for around 30 to 45 minutes before it started to take hold.", "Once it started, it was intense, and a lot of times scary.  There wasn't the paranoia of LSD, but there was this ability so sense the underlying themes of whatever was going on, especially in music.  There was just a menacing vibe everywhere, and it was all in all disturbing.", "Eventually, the effects became overpowered...it was difficult to function on any kind of level...walking was almost impossible, and coherent thought doubly so.  The most intense visual I had was like this:", "I was lying on the floor with my eyes closed, and just really wishing it would all go away.  I opened my eyes, and instead of seeing the carpet, I was looking over and down this huge, sheer embankment of what seemed like thousands of feet.  It actually felt like I was on top of this cliff, and it was NOT cool.  After that I just laid there for ? hours and waited for the effects to wear off.", "The entire next day, and even some into the next, I could feel the comedown, I just felt horrible.  I thought at the time that it was pretty cool, but then like I said, I finally got some LSD, and NEVER will I go back to od'ing on cold medicine for a high, and I do not recomend it...stick to the real stuff, it's a much better experience..", "I decided one day while in the car with a couple of my friedns to drink two bottles of robotussin and take about 25 contac cough caps. I had done this before but never in this high of a dosage. When it first hit me i felt some weird experiences. It was almost like i was floating and the car that i was in was flying through the sky. I also had many visuals. Anything that we drove by it seemed to fly at me and hit me in the face. I lost all of my motor skills and lost all of my ability to speak. It was a pretty cool experience until I started to come done from the experience. That was when I realized that i had a little to much and I started to barf and I passed out. ", "My friend that did not do anything tried to wake me up but couldn't so they called an ambulance. About four to five hours later i woke up in the E.R. room of the local hospital and found my self with two or three needles stuck in ach arm, with a tube going down my throat which was pumping my stomach, and one or two police officers standing around trying to ask me questions on what I had done. It was very scary. all I remember from that night was drinking it, the visuals and waking up in the hospital. It was the worst experience I had ever gone through. I will suggest to anyone that wants to do this NOT to drink Robotussin and take the contac pills, becasue with both it is WAY TO MUCH.", "I had taken approx. 200mg of DXM by drinking cough syrup.  About a week later I passed out due to heat exaustion (totally unrelated) and was taken to the hospital. While there PCP was detected in my blood but in a later urine test nothing was found. The urine test was given about 3 hours after the blood test was done. ", "From my experiance i conclude that dxm can make you test false positive for PCP in blood tests but not urine tests at a week after ingestion, so be careful if you know you're going to be tested.", "This is what I learned from my seven year experience. I was the ring leader in my city when it came to robo.  My first time was back in 1991, I was a Jr in high school. I did it everyday and I talked hundreds of others into doing it.  I lived in conservative Utah and grew up in a strong LDS (not LSD) home.  I was taught not to drink, smoke, or do drugs.  So when a friend told me I could feel high from my dad's cold medicine, I was excited to give it a try.  (stupid me) I loved it.", "This started me on a seven year rampage of promoting robo, drixoral, coricidin, and pure DXM. I was the main promoter of this so called harmless drug.  For this I am sorry because I still have friends and a twin brother who's lives are at a stand still.  My twin also developed pancreatitis and it is hard to be around him because he is still in bad shape.  I love my brother and I know I was the one that talked him into it in the first place.  He thinks he can't quit DXM and drinking even though our Dr says he will die if he keeps using.  I don't care how 'bad ass' and tough you think you are, you can't help but be in hell when your brother is killing himself with the same crap you spent six months convincing him to do.  As a former DXM user I know I realy could have cared less while I was doing drugs, but now I'm sober it hurts bad. I am not trying to preach, just to share info.  I wish this site would have been up in 1993.  Maybe I cold have read the part about brain dammage and quit soon enough that I could still spell like a normal 26 year old.  (I have been sober for 3 years and still feel like a third grader when it comes to grammer.) ", "My heart goes out to the mother who lost her son.  Also I feel for the mom and dads who's kids don't die but they still loose them to their new masters like DXM and other drugs. ", "I belive information is good, I plan to teach my children both sides of the story.  I will even use this web site. They might still be tempted at first when I tell them the fire is hot, but after I show them pictures of people burning alive, they might have enough information to resist the temptation.", "About a year ago I heard of this great new hallucinagen dextromethorphan.  I went ahead and waited a few months to see if there were any exteme side effects or risks. Seeing none, I decided it was worth a try.", "   My first experience with DXM involved drinking a bottle of Robutussin DM and vomiting for a while.  Undaunted, I decided to give it another chance a few weeks later.  Thinking my problem lay in my choice of mediums, I obtained some dex pills from a friend who had a prescription for them.  The dose suggested by the contact: 8-10 pills.", "   Having a health condition called hypoglycemia (low blood-sugar), I always eat nutritious food, especially before using any sort of recreational chemical.  Even sober, a low blood-sugar attack can cause fainting.", "   Everything appeared fine until about an hour and a half after I dosed.  Suddenly, the world flipped around and I found myself on my back, unable to speak, fighting to hold down a meal.  I could feel the drop, knew I was in trouble; I stayed consious throughout the next three hours of nightmare.", "   Somehow, I managed to get up off of the floor and lose the battle with my stomach into an appropriate toilet.  It was at this point that I noticed the repettitive twitches throughout my body.  Hell had begun to rise.", "   When the vomiting ceased, my blood-sugar had dropped to the point that I should have fainted.  Perhaps the dex kept me up; but it certainly was a treat to be concious of my friends, all of whom were also on dex, trying to help.  They all knew of my condition and what to do about it, the only trick was getting protein-rich foods to stay in me.  This proves not to work, and I begin to slip away, all the while screaming out for a stimulant to bring me out.  This came out as a quiet jumbled mess as I had very little strenth left, but someone remembered the vial of adrenalin in the refridgerator.  It was for her mother's allergy to bee stings, but it was winter and all the bees were gone.  Somehow, I managed to instruct them the right way to load the syringe and shoot me up w/o killing me in the process.  The stuff was made for injection into the heart, but I wasn't going to let shaky, scared, tripping people shove any needles into my heart.  To make a really long story just kinda long, I came back down that long black tunnel and ate some beans.  Eventually, I came out of the bathroom and had a decently enjoyable time with my semi-functioning brain and a head still full of dex. I felt like a marionette, what with the 'dex walk' as my friends called it.  No cosmic moments, but several defining ones, such as finally seeing my reflection in the mirror as my two friends held me up to it and exclaiming, 'Hey, I look like shit!' That was the first intelligable phrase I had said since this episode began.", "   This drug is a powerfull one, but not one that I will ever do again. In fact, as hypoglycemia is fairly common, I wouldn't suggest using DXM to anyone.  You might not even know you've got it.

Dextromethorphan (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide, usually when found in over-the-counter medications).", "You can find DXM in the local supermarket under the label 'Robotussin maximum strength cough' for approximately $1.00 per ounce. It is perfectly legal (at least, now it is...you never know what Newt Gingrich will do next), and is not for the weak-of-heart, at least not in the upper plateaus (Refer to the DXM FAQ in the Lycaeum and/or Erowid for more information about plateaus).", "I contribute this, these experiences of mine, to the Vaults of Erowid in order to further educate those who are seeking knowledge of DXM. Sure, you could be a rocket scientist for all I care, you still don't know shit until you've had the experience itself. I have been to the 4th plateau and back, which speaks for itself. ", "Really, the main questions you should ask yourself before trying DXM are: Am I afraid of my own mind? Am I afraid to look deeply into it? Am I afraid of leaving my body and existance behind? You can expect all of these to happen on an upper-plateau trip, for they most likely will. This contribution is meant to scare those who cannot handle DXM and to encourage those who can to think about trying it. It's all a personal choice, because if you were pushed into it, believe me, you won't like it.", "The thing about DXM that first interested me was it's spiritual depth at the upper plateaus. After a bit of reading the FAQ, I went to Publix and picked up an 8oz. bottle of Robo. Throughout the week after, I experimented with 2 plateau-1 trips and 1 plateau-2 trip. I thought just then that I knew exactly what would happen at the high 3rd plateau, but I was completely wrong. ", "After about another week, my friend and I got together and bought 2 8oz bottles and quickly arrived back at his house. We saluted each other, then clinked the bottles together and pointed the bottoms up as we guzzled it down. It took about 10 minutes to slowly finish each bottle with the least amount of nausea possible. We both had taken 8oz of Robo. About 15 minutes later, I was pacing nervously around his room, slightly off-balance while he was anticipating his nausea and relaxing on his chair. I almost puked on his floor as I held it painfully down, twice. As soon as it settled in my stomach again, I ran into the bathroom, only to be hit by the second plateau right at the doorway. I didn't know what was happening as I leaned into the bathroom, staring at the floor, but the puke that I saw directly below me answered my question. I had to clean it up later. I slowly but surely stepped over the puke and sat down on his bathtub next to his toilet, and forced myself to puke once again. With that, I sat there for what seemed 10 years. After about 15 minutes (2 years),  I saw my friend run by the bathroom into the other bathroom and heard him puking into the toilet. He had his coming as well. After that, he went into his room again and started playing nitrous oxide on his playstation. The next string of events seem like only a novel could explain them, but I have trouble finding the right words to remember them by.", "After a short while later, the 3rd plateau snuck up on me and grabbed me by the balls. I sat there as my body went almost completely numb and my mind drew a complete blank. All sensory input was diminished as I could only help but pay attention to nothing. I had the constant idea of my imminent death, but I did not fear it. It was simply a fact in my head. I could not feel fear. Only sorrow. But, the sorrow quickly diminished as the 4th plateau rolled in. It most surely shouldn't have rolled in, according to my weight/dosage calculations, but it did for whatever reasons. I had even checked and identified most symptoms of the 4th plataeu from William White's excellent DXM FAQ. I had complete amnesia for an hour. I forgot who I was, where I was, why I was there, or why I was alive. There must have been some reason for my life; it was on the tip of my tongue, but I had no idea whatsoever. The sense of sorrow quickly diminished as if I was a broken robot waiting for it's dismantlement. No emotion, complete apathy. A sense that I had never before had. I looked into the mirror while my vision was working every now and then, and wondered who that face belonged to, because it was so familiar. At times, my friend would stumble by the bathroom to check on me, because he knew there were razors and the like in there. Even if I had wanted to use them, I couldn't summon the willpower to move my arm. I don't know how I kept my balance on the side of the tub, nor how I answered my friend when my mouth wouldn't move, but he seemed to be satisfied. ", "What was even more interesting were the short periods of time (felt like 2 minutes each) where I would float over my own body, in the top corner of the roof and watch my body stare at the wall as my friend would try to talk to me. He would give up, then come back 10 minutes later and try again in vain. Once the knowledge of who I was returned to me in a gust of cold wind, I looked up with double-vision to see 2 of my friend standing there, trying to talk to me. I had to focus on my hearing to understand what he said. He wanted me to go into the other room with him and watch some TV and look out the window. I agreed only because he had a garbage bag with him just incase I had to vomit again, because I told him that I couldn't feel any of my body, so I couldn't know if my stomach was upset or not. It took an eternity and no time at the same time to speak. I couldn't tell. So, with my eyes plastered open as if I had drank 25 cups of coffee (As it makes you), I took giant, balanced steps out of the bathroom into his room, being ever so careful to lean against things so I wouldn't fall down the stairs. ", "Once I arrived in his room, I wondered how I got there. I was supposed to be in the bathroom. Could I have walked into his room and not remembered it 2 seconds later? I sat down very slowly and placed the garbage bag under my head incase. For the rest of the trip, it wasn't neccessary, but I didn't know that I wouldn't be vomiting anymore. The fact that I vomited was a big factor in the mood of the trip. After I stepped down to the 3rd plateau, I found myself with a little more sanity now. I stared out the window with my wide eyes, watching a palm tree slightly sway in the breeze. I still had the double-vision, so it was hard to focus on anything, but easy to focus on nothing and everything at the same time. After I plummetted down to the 2nd plateau, we went to another friend's house. We described what happened to him, and he was eager to try it (despite my warnings). He never told me what happened to him, but he's been doing it ever since. As I sobered up, I was left with a ray of hope for myself - the fact that I was alive. It was sort of a challenge. My halfway insane mind had lost the battle against itself, but not the war. It took about half a year for me to gather up enough courage to try it once again.", "This time, it was another one of my friends who had never tried it before and me. We hunted around supermarkets at 11:00 PM, trying to find a way to turn $11.06 into 16 oz. of Robo. It involved a lot of careful planning and some shoplifting, but we did it. We dosed at about 12:45 AM that night...it was a night that I will never forget. It was the night that I overcame my own mind. I had won the battle. At about 1:15, my friend vomited violently and commented, 'I feel like shit.' I had advised him to sit over his bucket and to try to calm down, but it didn't work. I, however, had the mental control that night to keep myself from vomiting. There were times that I thought I was going to vomit, but I was gladly mistaken and nothing came out. I eased myself into the journey. I forget the transition from the 2nd plateau to the third, but it clearly happened.", "I looked down at my watch at what seemed 2 minutes later and it was 2:30 AM. At this point, I was almost there. I had a panic attack, even though I didn't know it. My heart just started pounding violently and I started to sweat. Even though I was completely calm, I think it was my brain trying to tell me that there was something wrong - like I didn't know it. It elapsed after about 30 seconds of pounding, and then my trip took off. As I reached high 3rd plateau, I no longer saw through my eyes (Whether they were open or closed - I didn't know). I am still trying to sort out what happened that night. I can't remember much, only vague details. I had found myself back in the place that I was in 6 months before. I was deep inside myself, taking a stroll through my own consciousness. Occasionally, something loud enough would snap me back into a semi-dazed reality, mostly my friend tossing and turning on his bed trying desperately to go to sleep. I wanted so badly to try and comfort him, but my mouth couldn't form the words. ", "As I was enveloped in the swirling stream of thoughts and memories intertwined, I felt as if I was a boat. I struggled to steer myself through them using the right route, only to find myself back in my old situation...will I die? Will I be a vegetable? Obviously, no, because DXM didn't do that to people (At least not that kind of dosage), but my drug-induced mind was still wondering. At that moment, I used my strength and knowledge and looked to God for guidance. I felt as though I had a connection with God, one that I had never before had. Imagine the numbers 1 through 10, 1 being no DXM at all, and 10 being a fatal overdose of DXM...All numbers greater than 1 bring you that much closer to death, and in that, bring you that much closer to God. The upper plateaus are most definitely meant for spirituality. I was being cradled by God as he protected me from myself. I was comforted, more than I ever had been before. If I could cry that night, I would have. ", "I was continually searching through my mind, trying to reorganize it to help me understand the answers better. It was like hypnosis. It was beautiful. I saw anything and everything, I was the master and the slave of the universe. And I would give almost anything to remember what I had done to myself that night. My thoughts, my personality, my general ego had changed somewhat since that night, for the better. I wish I knew exactly what I did to change myself. All I know was that it was definitely worth it. After all that had happened, I looked at my watch and noticed that it was 2:40. After another 10 years of swimming through my mind, my watch read 2:50. After 2:50, I just stopped looking at my watch until I had lowered to the 2nd plateau. I couldn't look at my watch anyways, because I had double-vision after I had returned to reality on a 3rd plateau. I couldn't focus in on anything at all. ", "As I said, I forget much of what happened. Somewhere between the 2nd and 1st plateaus of coming down, my friend and I had a few short, numb conversations. It turned out that he thought he was going to die, like I did at first. He had the same terrible first trip that I had and has told me that he didn't want to do it again. I really don't know what to expect...whether or not he will try it again. The effects vary from mind to mind, and DXM is definitely not for everyone. You have to be strong-minded and sane, or you might end up a looney at the state-mental institution. I saw it as one of the possibilities (one of the routes that my boat could take) that I could have made. Complete insanity. It had it's benefits, and was slightly tempting, but I had plans for my life. I still have plans for my life. I have enrolled myself in a private college (finally) to get an associate's degree in computer applications. That last DXM trip made me realize that I don't need drugs (Besides the occasional beer at a special occasion, and maybe a geltab or two once a year) to live. I can meditate and bring myself to a psychedelic high whenever I want to. I just wanted an easy 'high.' ", "To sum it all up, I think I have finally found the peace that I deserve and have suffered for all my life. I don't know what to expect down the road, but I'm sure I can make it. If you want to take DXM, then PLEASE keep it to a recreational (lower plateau) dose, unless you know what you are doing. From what I saw on both occasions, DXM is a dangerous drug. With DXM, you can re-arrange your consciousness, whether you know it or not, or whether you know how to or not.

Felt a sudden flash of dizziness around 1:00, when hopping fences to get to the shack that I would be in for most the night. Started feeling woosy, finished off the rest of the bottle in the shack.

Couldn't focus on anything, very distorted vision. I saw a car coming and ran behind some low tree branches. Started to jog/run in fear of the police, wanted to arrive at the destination as soon as possible. I looked funny walking supposedly.

I  also looked at myself in the mirror the next day, and saw my image, but for some reason I felt separated, like a different unknown person, I felt that way that night too. That night I had the strangiest feeling of de-ja vu, like I did the whole process the before, I was almost convinced I did.

I was unable to sit up, but I could still move, but I couldn't feel my body at this point. I felt like I was receding into a point in the back of my head, and I was leaving reality behind. I began to come down after a while, and I was able to sit up, and I began vomiting. But it wasn't painful, and I barely felt any discomfort. But this is definitely not a drug I will be doing again any time soon.", "I've roboed seven or eight times so far, with each experience being slightly different from all of the rest. Lately, however, things have started to change (for the better!), as I've been studying and experimenting with various out-of-body states (while I'm sober). Additionally, I've been experimenting with alpha/theta stimulation CD's that influence your body to fall asleep, while your mind stays alert. Last night, I ingested 661 mg of DXM, and the journey began. Here are the two 'key moments':", "- While in a different state of existence (unlike physical reality), I began to summon every person that I've been in contact with throughout my entire life -- family, friends, enemies, people I've passed on the street, etc... It took a lot of mental effort, and quite a good deal of time before they were all present -- I could see each and every one them as a small glowing 'orb' of light; they all looked physically identical, yet somehow I knew who each one of the orbs was... I had an additional sense of perception -- I could look at any one of the orbs and I would immediately be flooded with that person's physical appearance, thoughts, feelings towards me, etc... Quite an overwhelming experience, considering how many people were present! Anyway, I decided that there was no way I could directly communicate with all of them, so I decided to 'emit' love and understanding to each and every person present, regardless of past disagreements or misunderstanding. A bright, golden light began pouring out of me and enveloped everyone who was present.", "- Not too long after, I found myself traveling to a realm that I could sense was much 'higher' in significance than any of the other places that I had visited. I ended up in the middle of an endless mass of silver/golden light -- I could feel every single particle of my being disintegrating and becoming part of the light-mass; indescribable sensations bombarded every part of me -- far greater than any pleasure that I've experienced here on Earth.", "All of these experiences were unlike any that I've ever had before. During my past robotrips, I always enjoyed myself, but all of my experiences were nothing more than hallucinations. As real as they seemed, I always knew that they weren't real. This time was -VERY- different; these experiences were as real as anything I've experienced in this life. As real as the cup of coffee sitting in front me. As real as the raindrops falling outside.", "I could write for hours, detailing all of my experiences last night, but, unfortunately, there aren't many words that I can think of that would accurately describe such experiences! It's like trying to describe an emotion (love, jealousy, etc.), without using other emotions in such description.", "I'm going to keep working very hard (without disassociates) on my out-of-body travel 'skills' for the next few weeks, and then I'll robotrip again and see how much farther I can go.", "Last weekend I went camping with a few friends and decided to dex. When we arrived, there was of course whiskey and pot. After we we set up camp, we each took a 500mg DXM cap. Then we crammed 8 people in a tiny car and drove forever back into town and went to the Waffle House. Everyone else was drunk and stoned and we were beginning to trip. We made it out of there without having the cops called on us and went back to the camping spot.", "We were tripping pretty hard by that time (nature has a great effect on psychedelics) and I was staring into the fire and everything else, including the loud drunks, just disappeared. They were of no importance. I began to communicate with the fire. I know this sounds very wierd, but psychedelics are just wierd...Anyway, I sensed the Spirit of that fire (not the Spirit of the Element, but that specific fire, which was dying down) as a fading, wise, old, and lonely man. It revealed to me that I would become all powerful if I gained the power of 4 Elements: Fire, Water, Land, and Air, and that I would have to do this by communicating or battling the Spirit of the Element. ", "It did not tell me this verbally..but through thoughts and feelings..it's very hard to explain. I respected the fire, and I could tell it had respect for me, and thought of me as a pupil, as Yoda felt toward Skywalker. It gave me it's power and fulfilled 1 of the 4 Elements I was to attain. All of this was very convincing and extremely strange. This was not a high dose either, but being in nature increased the wierdness. (I imagine the pot and alcohol did too...) We redosed later that night with about 400mg. I had the feeling of being in several places at once (sitting on the ice chest, in the chair, in the tent, etc) and I'd be like 'How the fuck did I get here?'", "The next day, I still felt pretty damn wierd and I had a battle with the water that was funny, but a battle nonetheless.", "The water came very close to winning, but I received the reward of its power. I have 2 Elements left to attain which will probably take me a while (yes, I still believe this even after the trip..call me crazy..whatever), but it is my goal and I will become all powerful. :) The battle I fear the most is with Air. I *really* do not want to confront it. Hopefully I can gain it's power without a fight. I know all this sounds very crazy..but I believe it.", "A friend had suggested trying a substance called DXM found in two cough mixtures here in South Africa. I tried it and enjoyed the first few times. Normally chugging a whole bottle and reaching the second plateau.", "The time in question I drank the bottle of Cepacol and went to sleep. The Cepacol is filled with anti-hystimines so it knocks you out. I awoke and had a momentary panic as I had no idea what was 'wrong' with me. Only when I glanced the empty bottle on the table did I remember and relax and start enjoying the trip.", "Keeping one's eyes open after Cepacol is quite a mission so I lay there experiencing some amazing closed eye visuals. Nothing too wayout until......... ", "Suddenly I was walking through a narrow little dark alley. The ground was cobbled, the buildings close together and the air heavy with smoke/smog. I looked up and saw one window with a little light flickering behind it - candlelight. Then it hit me. I was in London sometime during the Dickens era. The time of chimney sweeps, filthy children working in the coal mines and pickpockets. This was no hallucination, it felt so real I could feel and smell and hear it. ", "I walked around the corner looking at everything, the detail was amazing, I could see the scuff marks on the individual cobbles, the dirty edges of the window frames........ everything!! There was this old man warming himself at a fire set in a drum or bin with holes punched ito it. I asked him if I could warm myself too. He was a decidely scruffy chap. Old top hat with the top upright, torn woolly  gloves and a tatty overcoat. Your typical movie bum.", "He welcomed me telling me to sit on a box across from him, he said his name was Jafta and that he had lots of things to tell me. From there I can remember nothing about what he told me except that it was advice to me about my life, the people I should stay away from, the friendships I should make, the direction my career should go in, where I should look for happiness. It was unbelievable!! This old beggar knew everything about me, and many things I had never known consciously or admitted to myself. I am unable to remember any of the concrete details but I know that that conversation is stored in my subconscious and I have done some drastic life changing since then.", "When he finally finished talking to me I asked Jafta how he knew so much about me, my thoughts, my life, everything! He gave me the most beautiful smile and said to me ' I am you........... We're all you. I looked around and saw about 8 men all sitting around us, on the periphery. They were all smiling at me with utter beauty even though very few had teeth and were all dressed in rags similar to Jafta. They varied in age between me and Jafta. I realised that they were me at various stages in life. I have never felt so at peace and content as that moment when I realised I was sitting in the company of 9 other me's and they had been through times that I have yet to come to. ", "I awoke from this experience, still quite UTI and without enough sense to try and write down what Jafta had told me. None of the detail remains but if ever I had a life changing experience it was that one. I have no idea how long it lasted in real time but it felt as if I'd been talking to him all night, about 6 hours. I got off the couch and went straight to bed.", "The next time I took 300mg of DXm - about 6 months later, I had a horrific time. I remember nothing about the trip (thank goodness) but I 'came to' feeling filthy and revolted. Something bad had happened to me. I felt as if the drug/Jafta was telling me that I had got what I came looking for the last time, and that everytime I went back there it would be worse for me. ", "I enjoyed DXM and gained something I value very much and wish others could experience, but I won't go back for a while yet.", "Well I used to take DXM but only for the 1st plateau sensation since I like to be more active, dance, etc.  Reading up on the dosages/dangers/plateaus  I decided to go one beyond and slowly prepare myself for the later plateaus.  Well I bought 3 bottles of Vicks44 since they had no Robo Xtra Str.  I did about 2 1/2 bottles before I just couldn't stomach anymore syrup.  ", "So I then went into my bedroom and relaxed while I waited for it to take affect.  I wanted to be alone and somewhere familiar so I stayed home.  I always like to get my favorite music, close my eyes and experience it from there.  Well I listened to some Trance music, some older Cd's (Northern Expo 2, and Harddeserttrance 2) that I still appreciate to this day.  As soon as I started  Expo 2 (disc 1), I was already heavily feeling the euphoria that I've felt with 1st plateau and just started dancing.  ", "But quickly thereafter I noticed I wanted to sit down and close my eyes If you're familiar with the CD you'll know what I mean :) From there I clearly felt the second plataeu.  I noticed the music dictated where I was and where I was going.  I felt I was traveling at high speeds when the music would speed up, rising higher.  I noticed I felt as though I were in many different 'rooms'.  I began to, from what I understand, talk to my soul but very briefly about my upcoming divorce and my life thereafter.  I noticed for only brief moment I lost sense of this reality (I would clearly think about my responsibilities, things I had to do etc) and only gazed upon what other realities await me. I'd say the peak lasted the whole first CD then halfway thru the second (2 hours) where I began to regain a constant hold on my reality.  In between the CD's I got up and walked around my house for a bit and felt 'wobbly' and couldn't dictate my sense depth as the stairs became a chore to go down :)", "The experience has opened my eyes at what DXM can do, if only for what I saw was so limited as to what the Third/Fourth Plateaus behold.  I will try around 600mg next time to understand the Second Plataeu more before reaching the later stages.", "Well, for the majority of my days as a druggie, i've stuck mostly to herb and other related drugs, such as coke and weed mixed.  Just recently my 'robo head' sister and her friend Matt convinced me to try the amazing robo trip.  Not one to usually pass up a good time i agreed... much to my delight i would later acknowledge.", "i would guess it was about 7pm when i guzzled the bottle down, and for a while nothing happened.  I didn't throw up as i suspected i would, but it took about an hour to an hour and a half for the trip to actually kick in.  We were on our way to the public beach parking, around 8:30, and i was feeling normal, or so i thought.  It wasn't until i attempted to step out of the car and nearly fell over that i realized i was flying.  After a few seconds of short-lived skydom, i returned to my senses somewhat.  By then Matt and Mel, my sister, were already completely gone.  We rather slowly made our way onto the beach, where i, amazed by a new found sight, got lost in time.  ", "As i stood on the beach idly staring at a light, which at one moment looked to be a mere few feet away and then a few miles, my sister had collapsed behind me into a praying position in the sand.  As my sister prayed to the beach gods, our friend Matt stared at the sky commenting on the beautiful stars.  Nevermind the fact that it was somewhat overcast, he saw them all perfectly, so who am i to ruin his fun, right?", "As i returned my eyes to the glorifying light, i realized i had begun to itch quite irritably.  Under closer observation i noticed i had broken out into hives and my lips had gotten swollen.  Completely freaked, i jumped in the car, yelling for Mel and Matt to follow, and began frantically ripping off my shirt.  If you can picture this:  one person in the back seat going crazy and tearing his attire from his hive-covered body, the other two staring in amazement, when they should have been watching the road.  It must have been quite funny, since we attracted far more attention than i would have liked.", "    My name is Rob L. and I have a comment to make about Dextromethorphan and drug testing. A few months ago, my friend Lance K. recreationally ate approximately 500mg of 99.9% pure dextromethorphan hydrobromide aquired from a pharaceutical laboratory (placed inside a gelatin capsule) .  It was his first experience with the chemical and things didnt go too well.", "    He started to lose his sense of reality and complained about being in 'outer space' and 'seeing planets'. Having convinced himself he would die, he called the ambulence and was rushed to the emergency room. He was afraid to tell the doctors he had eaten the DXM, (because of the anticipated negative reaction from his family and friends) so he remained quiet and did not tell the doctors he had intentionaly ingested the substance. They pumped his stomach and gave him a drug test, thinking he had his food in the cafeteria (this was in school) 'spiked' with drugs. The drug test result showed up positive for PCP (phencyclidine). Lance had never done an illegal drug before, let alone one as dangerous as PCP. I am wondering if anyone has had or heard of a similar experience, and if anyone out there in the medical profession, or a toxicologist could explain why this causes false positives for PCP. I think that its important to know that DXM could cause a false positive on tests, and for how long this false reading could persist after ingesting the chemical. Thank you!", "8:40 PM Alone- ingested 4 oz bottle of Robo CF (Guafinesen included! Doh... oh well)", "Listening to Dead Kennedys, Crass, and Black Flag on WinAmp.

But it's so damn interesting.  I can't believe this shit isn't scheduled.  Hell yeah. Now some trip reports. I'm doing shit very mechanically, like I usually have to brush ants off my legs (don't ask) when I sit here at the computer and I just now realized that I brushed an ant off my leg a few minutes before without thinking.", "My parents and sister will be back at about 12:00 and I need to figure out where the hell to put the Robo bottle I stole from the hall closet.  You see I'm living in Brasil for a year while my parents do research here.  I think DXM is scheduled here because wherever I ask (in Portuguese) for Cough Medicine and then specifically ask for the DXM ingredient they just look at me funny like it doesn't even exist.

I was about to 'Posse eu recibir a golpe?'/'Can I get a hit?' when he bolted thinking I was some 8 year-old about to tell his mommy.

How I long for the days where me and about 10 other heads walked across the school grounds to go to Rachel's house to spark a few blunts and Js or drink a couple pints of $20 Vodka in a plastic jug.  Thats one of the reasons I tryed this, ive only seen two people smoking maconha/herb here in Brasil so far and I didn't have the guts to ask for a hit either time.

Oh well.", "In my hometown, I met a guy who turned out to be one of my very best friends.  As I got to know him better, I soon learned that he used drugs.  Now, at the time, I didn't, so I kind of looked down on him for it.  Eventually, he convinced me to try marijuana, but then I went to college, and I didn't see him until summer.  That summer, I went to his house one day, and he suggested that we go into the woods with two other friends of ours and his girlfriend and take some Dex (our name for DXM).  Not having anything to do that day, I agreed.", "Soon after, the others that would take the journey with us arrived, and one of the guys measured out the doses of Dex.  After taking half of our doses, we went out onto the nature trail that was to be our trip spot.  We started out in the woods, slightly off the trail, where we took the other half of our doses.  After chilling and drinking some OJ, I started to feel a little strange, although the sensation was not at all unpleasent.  We went down to a lake that was nearby and talked for a while, and then suddenly I realized that I was alone with the one guy I knew the least.  I slowly realized that everyone had gone around the lake to a clearing, but I just sat and talked to my friend about life.  At this point I had lost all understanding of what was occuring around me, but I didn't care.  I simply sat and watched as a daddy longlegs walked on my arm and marveled at its life force.  Soon I found myself walking around the lake to the clearing, where we smoked a bowl.  However, there were boats on the lake, so we walked back to the trail and sat for a while.  We then stood up and formed a circle, and bowed our heads in the middle.  As I looked down, a strange voice told us to fall into the earth, and as it said this I slowly slid out of my body into the ground.  I have no idea how long this oneness with the earth lasted, but when we went into the circle, it was bright daylight.  When we came out of the circle, it was pitch black outside.  After talking about the experience, we used the flashlights we brought with to find our way home.", "After we got home, we smoked two more bowls and talked about the experience.  Although I or they will never be able to properly explain what happened in the woods, I can say that it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life.", "*This was orginally posted to the usenet newsgroup alt.drugs.psychedelics*", "You may have noticed my post titled 'DXM Virgin' where my mate wanted to take DXM to go to a concert. I managed to dissuade him and we took E instead. I took 2.5 tabs, 1.5 more than I normally would, simply cos he was (yeah I am too easily persuaded).", "So anyway he came over on Saturday night and we got some wine and smoked some weed. The next day I woke up feeling a little the worse for wear, but not too bad. My friend came down again and we smoked another 3 or 4 joints before he had the idea to take some dex. I didn't think this was a good idea as it was Sunday evening and I had work the next day, and from what I had read on the FAQ this wasn't your typical drug. BTW I have never taken it before.", "But stupidly I was talked into taking some. I had some in powdered form, so measuring it was pretty hard. All we did was measure what looked like a quarter of a gram (250mg) put it in a skin and swallow it. This was at 5:30pm on Sunday.", "After about an hour nothing much was happening so (fucking idiots) we decided to repeat this again. About an hour later I started to feel really strange and felt as though I was sinking into the couch. I didn't feel like talking much and for a while I didn't notice any major effects. My mate was well tripping and was talking about his mind being ahead of his body and stuff, so I guessed it had hit him.", "Anyhow we sat for quite a while and then he had to go home (I think at about 9:00pm). This was when the DEX hit me hard. I couldn't walk properly and when I stood up I felt it took ages and I stood up in stages rather than in one fluid movement. I felt I had grown bigger in proportion to the room and that everything had a cartoon like sheen to it. I stumbled into my room and onto my bed. I lay there for ages just thinking. That's the only way I can put it. Thinking about how fucked up I was and how I shouldn't have been persuaded into taking it and about various other things. Time started to go really slow for me. I thought I had been lying on my bed for hours when my girlfriend came into the room and it had only been around 30mins.", "The next few hours were like a blur. All I remember were patterns of green and red and alien like visions. Sound was very distorted and I remember being very confused. I saw visions of myself as a young child and visions of me lying in bed when I was younger and having tough times and somehow being comforted by it.", "These hours felt like days. I managed to stumble up to feed my cat but my movements were like clockwork. I moved like a clockwork zombie. My brain was telling my limbs to move but they were far behind my thoughts. I remember looking up to see my hand reach out to grab the catmeat and it looked alien somehow. The fact that I could move at all without help or without hurting myself was good I thought, I can't be that fucked up..I let the cat out and felt as though I was seeing reality through a green treacle. Everything was moving in slow mo even sound and it was very strange indeed.", "I went to bed and lay there for what seemed like days but it could only have been hours. I didn't want to close my eyes cos this only brought even more intense closed eye visuals which I can only describe as an interlocking lattice of microchips, motherboards and living matter (green and black, looking like something HR Giger would create). At 12:00am my girlfriend joined me and I fell asleep. I cant believe I managed to do this. It was so intense.", "The next morning (Monday) I woke up and felt very much still under the influence. My movements were better and easier and my head clearer but there was definitely a fuzziness surrounding me. I wasn't back to reality by any manner of means. I phoned in sick to my work (I definitely had to, everything was still very fucked up) and stumbled back onto my bed to feel sorry for myself and to worry how long this was to last. Again I just lay there and thought about things, about my life and about the fact that I had trouble in the past after taking LSD and stuff and just pondered and pondered...", "I 'woke up' (I didn't really sleep) around 2:30 and stumbled in to phone my mate. He was off work too and when I phoned his house he was still fucked up, but like me, getting better. Better is the right word, I felt sicker than I have ever felt before. It was comforting to know he was fucked up too and that we were recovering somewhat at a similar rate. He laughed and told me he felt strange and could I imagine what this must've done to our minds to leave us in such a state.", "I said I would phone him later and went back to bed. My communication faculties were getting back to normal, I noticed this during our conversation, so I felt better and felt I was making a recovery. I went to bed and slept for a thousand years. I woke up at 6:00pm and phoned him again, the two of us felt much the same as before still sluggish with a change in visuals and a grogginess. I told him I was scared that this would", "now be normal and that I had suffered brain damage.", "He laughed and said I was to phone him at 10:00pm and if we didn't feel better we would see each other at hospital. I laughed and scolded myself for being so melodramatic. But a voice at the back of my head still thought the worse. Went up to my brothers house to pick up mail and saw my g/f's mum at her house.  Managed to act fairly normal. Offered Chinese takeaway at g/f's mum's. No appetite at all. Haven't eaten since Sunday evening before ingesting the dex. hmm.", "Phoned mate at 10:00pm and the two of us were a tiny bit better so we left it at that.

I phoned in sick to my work and managed to sound reasonably coherent so I think I am getting better still. Still, there is a buzzing and a perceptual change so everything isn't a-ok just yet. Still a little scared. What have I done to my grey matter? Tell my girlfriend this. Get some breakfast (hunger returning - good sign again!) and go in for a shower. I feel pretty strange still. This is now two days later.", "Fucking hell. I manage to go to the bank to pay some bills (I walked btw it is 100 meters or so) and found communicating a hassle. Manage to sort it out.

I'm glad I can read them and look for any on DXM for any help on how I am feeling. See one from a poster where he is tripping for a few days but notice this is from a slow release syrup whereas I have taken DXM Hbr powder. Shitcakes.", "I am feeling better even as I write this but I haven't been outside for a while and had to communicate with anyone except for my g/f. So we shall see. But my intention of writing all this was to get some advice on a few things. Firstly what plateau do you think I reached. I really cant work it out. I am approx. 170plbs and I think I took about 500mg ( a very rough guess-timate).", "Also how long before I return to normal? How common is it for a DXM trip to last this long?", "I can feel myself getting better but you just never know. Any side effects I should look out for short/long term?", "Thanks for reading, this is more like a trip report now, but I was scared. Still am. But the fact I wrote all this is a good sign right? I think it is written reasonably intelligently without all the spelling mistakes I normally see by DMXers. I'm sure I will be flamed a bit for being such a lamer, and you know what, I deserve it. This is the most intense drug ever. This fucked my mind and then ate it. Fuck knows how long it will be before I feel like a normal person again. I was scared especially because of the proximity of taking E and then the dex. Something I've read about this being a really bad idea. Any other thought/comments much appreciated.", "I planned to down a bottle o' tussin and go to the local theatre- I work there so I get to see all the movies scot free- anywayz- I drank a 4 oz bottle about an hour before the showing of I dreamed of Africa- frankly I was disappointed- I've done robo once before- and last time was pure madness- this time- I enjoyed my movie- but the shit wasn't kicking in hard- I was just slightly high.", "the next morning I had to wake up for work feeling as if I had just run the boston marathon- I was dead tired- and I was shitting water the next day- I still think DXM has some potential- but I'll try a more closely monitored dose next tiume- and I think I'm sticking to pills next time- all in all- not an especially bad experience- but not especially good either.", "After weeks of going through everything I can find on DXM, I decided to give it a try. On my way back from work I got a bottle of Cough Syrup containing 750 mg of DXM. Since it was my first time trying the stuff, and my first experience with dissociatives, I decided to aim for a second plateau experience. I calculated that half of the bottle would provide me with around 375 mg of DXM, the dosage being somewhere around 5.2mg of DXM/kg. I started drinking the syrup around 9:30 PM and I was struck by how disgusting the syrup was. I found that holding my nose helped at first, but it was soon very hard to drink it, no matter what I did. I finished drinking it around 10:00 PM. Around 10:35 PM, I started getting nauseous but was still able to keep it down. Ten minutes later my vision became distorted like it is when you're really drunk. There was no CEVs and my thought processes were unaffected. At around 11:02 I puked my guts out for 10 minutes. I did feel better afterwards, but I started getting a very intense diarrea. Walking was very hard, in fact I had to ask my floormates to carry me to the bathroom. Since it was clear by then that the experience wasn't going as planned anymore, I called my friend and asked her to be my sitter. She helped immensely by carrying me to the bathroom, making sure I didn't get dehydrated, etc(I would like to point out that I should've asked for my friend to be my sitter before I actually started tripping...my advice to everyone is to have a sober person nearby). I started coming down around 1:00 in the morning, at that point I was able to go to the bathroom without her help. I'd like to point out that the diarrea was still very intense, forcing me to go to the bathroom every 5 minutes or so. It's now 2:30 in the morning, and I feel fine, save that I'm really drained from the experience and I still have the damn diarrea!", "While this wasn't my finest tripping hour, I'm glad I had the experience. While I might try DXM in the future(it won't be anytime soon!!), I will never do it in the cough syrup form again. My advice to anyone interested in DXM is to try an extraction process or just buy the pure stuff.", "I have been using DXM for about 5 yrs. now, and it is a wonderful experience. I also had some very weird times as well. Let me talk about the wonderful side of it first and the remarkable visions and trips, voyages, Free-falling like an airplane doing a nose dive and all the other stuff.", "I always take it at night because during the day at that level everthing is flanged it is hard to walk. Not to mention when my brain suddenly gets scattered around the universe and then I have to stop (or it appeared) and gather each little piece up and put it back together, it gets a little hard to know where I'm going. ", "I would take 2 boxes of coricidin, wait about an hour then drink a bottle of Delsym. After and hour it kicks in then everything starts to become translucent like and I can sense and hear things at the same time. I am already a little physcic and when this happens I just get shot up (phsycicly) into the stratosphere. I mean I know what is on peoples mind and, it seems now, telling people what is going on when they do not have a clue themselves and wonder how the world I knew about it. ", "Then I go to dream. Colors galore. I am so out of it I see other rooms, places, worlds, alien environments, contact with other lifeforms-spiritual entites, And have amazing conversations with them. ", "I also witness some amazing animated cartoons. Let me describe one of them that I will never forget.", "It all started out in/on the ground. A path. Two bullets where chasing a robber. The bullets where white and had points to their heads. Zipping along at REAL fast speeds. And the robber was always just out of their reach. He was gasping for breath because of all the running. Well, the bullets where chasing him for about (it seemed) 25 minutes and then suddenly ran into a stop (wwhich was nothing more than a high wall). Their was a big and loud BANG. The bullets obviosly killed the man they were after. The one bullet got up and said (and I heard this in realtime) 'Now where did he go' and the other bullet said 'I have absolutley NO idea' and they walked off the stage. ", "Another time I had a vision. It was like I was in front of a 101 inch TV about two feet away (now this is in technicolor and live action). I was wittnessing a crash in slow motion in a VERY busy side of a city. Their was this tanker-semi with alot of fuel in it turning the corner and this red small passenger car went smashing into it. And in slow motion the whole time I saw the explosion. The car went in the middle of the tanker-semi, it split in half, dumping all its fuel. Sparks were flying all around and ignited the fuel. Their was this GIGANTIC explosion and I saw it all in super slow motion. ", "These are the type of visions I have. Very realistic and like I am actually there wittnessing these events. But, every experience I have is differant, not one is the same. ", "Now I will tell about some VERY weird times I had on it. I drank 1 bottle of creomolsion and 1 bottle of delsym. I knew it was and OD but did it anyway. I didn't have alot of visions that night because Of the mind-body load, but the next morning I woke up and found, to my shock and total amazement, that the automatic part of my brain was completly knocked of and I had to assume manuel control. Now THAT is extremely hairy. I had my breathing go off the par too and had to manualy control that too, but that is another experience. I had to be very,very carful of how I thought. The slightest negative thought would shoot my heart rate up, my breathing would become impaired, panic attacks were common. I had to stay on top of that thin line just to keep myself normal. ", "After awile, I found that I could control every aspect of my autonomic nervous system. If I thought ny leg would cramp up, it would. My leg would start to tighten up and then I would release it and it would go back to normal. It was amazing and really interesting. I could call up the death sequence and I would feel Hell, halloween, and like a zombie at the same time. Also my heart would race and I would feel death start to sit in. Then I would reverse this and feel relaxed again. Now, all this was happening in my mind. I did not under any circumstances let any one know waht I was experiencing, It was a silent trip that lasted the whole day. It was truly amazing.", "I have other experiences to talk about, but for know, I'll stop.", "A word of warning: I built up my tolerance to this level over a period of five years and am so used to the effects and delusions and the VERY weird bodily perceptions that I am used to it and it does not bother me. If I had tried these doses initially I would probably have ended up in the hospital thinking I was dying, and in all likelyhood, I would have believed the hallucinations and delusions.  This is an extremely powerful drug.", "What a trip. It was my first experience. I was back in Saudi Arabia visiting my father. Back there, there isn't a damn thing to do. It costs about $1 a minute to be online. So, my brothers had been there awhile and made some friends. They would always talk about this 'DXM.' Whatever this was, it was obviously a strange drug of some kind. So, we went to the rec center on the compound for the night (we would just say something like, 'I'm gonna be over at his house' and my dad wouldn't care). I remember taking a whole box of Tuslar and just sitting for about an hour waiting for this stuff to work its magic. My brothers were experienced with it and told me it would take a while.", "Time released crap. So, I can't remember when it first hit.", "I just know I was getting really conversational and talking about stupid stuff like girlfriends with my brother, which I would never do normally. Then I recall being in the front hallway and watching my brother try to break down one of the locked doors by jumping into it. He came to me and my brother and his friend, who were talking about god knows what, and said, 'If we just work together we could break it down.' I knew we were messed up on the stuff. But dammit, we had to break that door down. So, I went with my brother to jump into the door, but he soon lost interest. The next thing I remember was being upstairs and running around the workout equipment they had there, then settling in the front room on the couch as my brain began to feel as though it was on fire. (My brother's friend had taken twice as many pills as I had and was in a trance on the 4th plateau, which was the biggest stoner jibberish I had ever heard at the time). And so my brain was on fire, as well as my throat.", "I sat down on the couch and thought I was dying, the worst part of the trip. My brother heard my distress and told me just to fall on the floor and you'll calm down. I did so. I began to scream, 'I'm dying!' repeatedly. Then time passed. My eyes were shut and I did calm down. I felt as though I was traveling through some kind of tunnel with odd colors on the walls. It was fun, but then nausea set in. We were beginning to leave. I grabbed my hat then went downstairs. I started to feel my stomach and ran straight to the bathroom where I dry heaved into the toilet. Not fun.", "I believe I blacked out during that time because I just remember talking jibberish and my brother's friend's brother trying to calm me down as I laid over the toilet seat.", "Then we left the rec center for my brother's friend's house, where another great adventure took place. We came in the house and sat on the couch, where I tried to fall asleep. I was successful in falling asleep but not successful in staying asleep, I would come in and out of sleep it seemed every hour of the night. My brother's friend's other brother got up and announced to us exceptionally loudly that he had to puke. So, he ran to the bathroom. About an hour later, we were asking where he was, then a voice (where it came from was a mystery) told us he was in the bathroom asleep on the toilet. He had fallen asleep while trying to puke in the toilet. So we woke him up and he came out and sat on the adjacent couch where his brother was playing a Playstation game. I had to go to the bathroom, bad. So, I got up to go to the bathroom, having a great adventure trying to walk ten feet without any motor skills in my legs. I felt like jello. When I came out of the bathroom, I again jello walked to the couch and plopped down. That's all I remember except waking up in a bed upstairs the next morning with a helluva headache.", "This was my first trip with DXM, and it was really cool.  It was such a great feeling, wonderous in a way. I first heard about DXM when I first visited this site (researching LSD).  I found this place and said 'Woah, look at all these drugs I've never heard about'.  DXM was one listed, once I found out what it was, and what it's potential hazards were(almost 0 at low doses), I had to try it.  I set a date for saturday morning to take it (it was friday night at the time) and went to bed to ensure that I'd wake up before noon.", "I took the stuff shortly after I'd got up.  For about an hour before I took it I watched some comedy and relaxed, to make sure I was in a good, happy mindset, to ensure a good trip.", "I went up to my room and measured out some of the vicks 44 cough syrup, enough containing 210 mg of dextromethorphan hydrobromide.  I mixed the stuff in a fairly large glass with some sprite.  It tasted terrible, and since I'm a wimp it took me about 30 minutes to get it all down.  By that time I was already feeling the starting effects, a feeling that things are somehow different, a slight drunk feeling and slight loss of coordination.", "I started to listen to music, but noticed no change yet.  It was at this time my brother yelled to me 'Do you want some pizza?'  I yelled back 'Yeah, sure.', even though I had no desire to eat whatsoever, my stomach was still a bit uppity from the vile taste of the cough syrup.", "Anyway I went downstairs to wait for the pizza, and decided to watch home improvement with my brother.  I was coming up fast and the T.V show quickly seemed different.  It was kinda like how the T.V sounds when you are woken up by it, quite different and more real than normal.  Also I felt somewhat as if I were actually there, watching the scenes, kinda like someone watching with a telescope.", "Right after the show had finish I was starting to peak, and noticed my brother looking at me somewhat strangely.  I decided to get up from laying down on the couch, I immideatly noticed that when I got up it felt as if my body were about to float away, placidly into bliss.  A wonderous feeling indeed!  But my brain, my mind, it felt like my mind was staying put, whereas my spirit (even though I don't believe in such things) was about to leave and go have a good euphoric time.  Now that I look back on it this must have been the dissociative aspect of the drug.  I felt this drifty-floaty feeling throught the whole trip.  This feeling can also make it feel like you jump extremely high.  I tried jumping, and although I know I only jumped up about 2 inches, it felt like I jumped up 20 feet.", "Then I decided to go look at myself in the mirrir, I noticed that my pupils were dialated extremely widely, I chuckled and went 'woahh man! That's funky!', out loud, even though I didn't mean to.", "Then I decided to go back up to my room for the rest of the trip, because I thought that people would notice by my pupils that I was tripped out.  I needed some more music though, so I went to my computer to upload some more music to listen to, it was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.  I could not read at all, all the words were so blurry it was impossible.  I had to squint real hard to be able to read things, and the clarity only lasted for a second before I could not keep squinting.", "I finally uploaded the music and went up to my room.  I was really hitting the peak of my trip about now.  I layed on my bed listening to music.  I tossed and turned around, oh how good that felt!  Every move I made produced such a euphoric joy in my head and all over my body.  Then I got up and danced to the music, which was astounding.  I felt so uninhibited by an undescriable force that had existed for all my life and kept me from this state of freeness.  It was if I were fully able to move in all 3 dimensions as I pleased.", "After a while I noticed I was starting to come down, which was good, beacause I was, believe it or not, getting a bit tired of feeling so happy after every move I made.  The coming down was very slow indeed, lasting about 2 and a half hours totally, also with a slight, pleasant lethargy lasting all night.", "The next morning I woke up physically well rested and alert, but my mind felt somewhat more tired than my body, which wasn't a bad feeling at all. Not good but not bad.", "I'm an 18 year old college student. I live in a dorm on my campus and consider myself to have pretty good knowledge of drugs. Thats why I was amazed to find to find that this small campus had a drug that I had never heard of before. I come from a big city and I've done it all but never anything like this. ", "I got these white pills from a guy down the hall in exchange for some stuff that I had. The guy told specifically 'split this capsule in half, this is strong shit!'. Well, I was thinking yeah right, I'm 6'5' 220 pounds I can handle one of these pills. So I waited till I had a free night and took it. About 2 hours later at a soroity party it hit me. I did alright for a while. Then about an hour into it I lost all cordination. My head was pounding and I was hearing crazy sounds with bad visuals. ", "A couple of my friends took me upstairs to a room to smoke out. The room was tiny and I lost it after 2 bowls. I couldn't get down the steps. My friend carried me to his girlfriend's truck and drove me back to my dorm. I couldn't see, walk, or hear. He carried me up the stairs and put me im my bed. For what seemed like the next six hours I heard the door open and close. I had no motor skills at all and was babling about being stuck in midget land. When I woke up the next morning I was happy to be alive. Be warned this is a powerful drug. It is a ten times more powerful than the best acid I've eaten. Listen to your supplier. Only eat a little.", "When I was a more experimental youth I usd to get high off cough syrup, but I stopped after the fifth trip, the trip described in the following report. It was the highest I have ever been in my life. ", "My friend G and I were hiking through Tilden on an effort to get high. We had only the shakiest of the schwag, so we had to look to other options if we wanted to cop a decent buzz. I happened to choose cough syrup, while G chose budweiser. The form I took the DXM in was easier to swallow than syrup: these little red pills called Drixoral Cough Pills or something like that, each containing about 50 -100mg of DXM. I chased about a dozen of these little suckers with budweiser, which my stomach quickly expelled, but not before I had absorbed a fair amount of the drug.", "Before I came up completely my friend had decided we leave the wilderness (I recall laying down and complaining of sleepiness) and travel to our buddy M's house. Along the way I lost my stomach, but this made me feel alot better. By the time we got to my friends house, the initial confusion of the trip was giving way to true psychedelic experience.", "Before I had felt extremmely dizzy and tired, but after puking the dizziness left me feeling light headed and somehow disconnected from my body. Walking felt more like swimming, and images of rooms and people flowed past me as if i were stationary. Soon my visual field broke down completely. This lasted for an infinite stretch of time. My friends tell me I sat in a chair without really moving for hours on end, staring at blank space without aknowledging anyone or even accepting a joint as it was handed to me (I do remember accepting a hit one, right before my catatonia hit ...).", "What I experienced was the most amazing visual hallucination I can recall. My minds eye was completely open, and I thought I could view all angles at once. The best analogy would be that normal vision is a 20 inch television, but the mind's eye on DXM is an Imax theater. The boundaries of my vision were gone, and I could focus on everything simultaneously. The lands I visited were infinite and varied, but I forgot most the details. One world was an outer space landscape filled with creatures and objects that were constantly in states of trasmutation. I stayed here fir what felt like eons, before the vision gave way to a Dante's Inferno-esque landscape. The ground was rocky and barren, but the horizon was a sheet of pure hellfire. Within the flames burned the images of the band Metallica (in the real world my friends were blasting 'and Justice'). ", "I believe that my spirit had left my body during these experiences, and I actually adventure within some of the realms that exist between the perceptual universe. This experience was incredably exhilirating, and I believe that with further trips soem tangible wisdom can be gained therein. However the drug method of spiritual travel left my body fatigued and my mind weary. My spirit eventually took back my physical body, at which point my eyes snapped open. Of this world I saw only two enormously wrinkled snakes, made out of cotton. They were floating in front of me, then on top of me, then they landed at my waist and formed my legs. I realized that now I could walk, and in an effort to prove it I promptly fell out of the chair that had housed my body while my mind flew between worlds. My friends looked up at me as startled as you might expect an embalmer to feel as if his cleint's rose from their slabs suddenly. It was the first indication of intelligent life I had made in  hours, and I lay strewn across the rug like a bearskin rug. To make a long story short, some beer and pot greatly improved my condition, and in no time I was blathering about my experience to a deaf audience. They had never heard of cough syrup trips, and I think that after my experience, they will never try it themselves. Too bad for them; James Hetfield plays incredibly well as a fifty foot wall of flame.", "Well, first of all, I tried DXM twice before.  A friend came over and gave me like half a bag of the powder.  It was probably more than an ounce.  The first time I took it, I passed out cold after 10 minutes of indigestion.  My friend, though, said he tripped the whole night.  I felt bad for making him trip by himself.  But anyways, the second time the same damn thing happened to me.  ", "OK...so now we come to the third time.  It was a friday night and I did not feel like going out and I knew I had the rest of that stuff.  So I told my roomate that I was going to eat the rest of the bag and for him to leave me alone in my room unless I really start screaming or something.  So I ate the two tablespoons, in a small glass of wine, and freaking five minutes later I was in my room and I started to feel really wierd.  Then all of a sudden my head felt like it had needles poking into it and it itched really really bad, but I would scratch it and it really wouldn't go away.  So I decided to take a shower and get ready for whatever was in store (mind you...it has been FIVE minutes!) OK...so I am in the shower and it really starts to hit.  I started to get really dizzy and put my head on the wall and let the water run all over me.  It wasn't as cool as I thought it was going to be.  ", "So I got out of the shower and barely made it to my room.  I just collapsed in my bed (now its been like 20 minutes).  I started seeing all kinds of stuff in the shadows.  I had my Aiwa stereo on and the lights from the music made these dancing 'figures' all over my room.  I was not scared at all.  I just felt really 'wierd'...actually really really really wierd.  I ended up laying there and manifested this whole party at my house.  I dont know how long it lasted because at this time I could not see at all.  I could see, but, for example, when I looked at my alarm clock, it looked like the numbers were moving up and down really really fast in about an 8 inch high motion.  And I kept hearing all kinds of stuff.  I cant really describe it, just like scratching sounds, like if you ran an electrified wire over a metal surface...kind like a welding machine.  And other sound as well, like just echos of noises...nothing I can pinpoint at all.  ", "But anyways, back to the story.  I ended up meeting all these people at MY party!  It was like there were all these people at my house and I was 'floating' around very peacfully introducing myself and welcoming them to my house.   Then I remember things got really wierd at the 'party'.  There were these girls and they were upset at me because I did not have the right furniture in my house.  This made me feel very strange.  At that time I came back to my room and was once again in my bed.  This is when I realized just how fucked up I really was and just decided to sleep it off.", "Well of course that didn't work so I called my roomates girlfriend to come up and just talk to me (I was not freaking out at all...I just wanted to talk to someone for a little while).  Well she came up and asked me what up and when I tried to talk I couldn't!  I had to concentrate really hard to get a word out and when it came out I said the word like 30-40 times.  I couldn't stop saying the words.  AT ALL!  For example, I tried to tell her this 'Why did those girls get made because of the furniture?' but it came out like this...'Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why did did did did did did did did did did did did did did those thooooose thoooooose thooooose thoooose......'.  I knew I was doing it but I was totally out of control.  Also, when I would talk to her I would raise out of my body from my legs and be 'standing' there like normal.", "I tried to get out of my bed when I was really phucked up and I could only stand there.  If I moved I would have fallen, I knew that much...so I laid back down.  I liked watching my clock radio.  The numbers...I will never forget that.", "I ended up falling asleep and waking up the next day still fucked up hard core.  I still could barely walk.  I walked downstairs and looked at the empty bag and just shook my head.  When I did that I saw mad tracers all over and for about the next 7 hours I was constantly seeing stars.", "I would say that I sobered up on Sunday when I woke up.  In actuality though, I was probably fucked up for a good 15 hours on the shit.", "Thats all I wanted, just to see what it was like.  Personally I think I over did it because I don't remember much from the night because I was soooo phucked up.  I will never do it again.  I will never forget that awful feeling on my head with the needles.  I had my fun and personal experience.....bye bye DXM.  Peace, Im Out.", "I felt very urged to write of my experiences with DXM after I read one of the 'experiences' of another author and they described suicidal-tendencies and depressive-withdrawl after they weren't on the DXM high.", "I have thought out this subject EXTENSIVELY and would like to share my findings. I have done DXM about.. 50 times now.  All with pills, I've never Tussin'ed it.  When I am on a DXM high, my mind works very efficiently and intelligently.  As many authors have said, there is a definite feeling of 'out of body' and 'away from one's self.'  When this occurs, all self-conciousness is completely gone and my mind turns to the deep meaning and truths of life.  ", "EVERY TIME I have been high, I think to myself, 'Why can't I be like this all the time?'  Because it seems as though all of my actions are logical and fun.  I seem to always make the right decisions.  I become very talkative to people and immediately get into deep discussions with people that I don't even know.  I believe all my choices that I have ever made on DXM have been correct.  It has done SOOOO much for me personally, I've learned alot about people, society, fear, and just life.  I know this sounds really cheesy but its true.", "But to address the 'suicidal' issue.  I used to think, 'Man, I wish I was on a DXM high all the time!' when I was on it.  But then I realize that, although its the greatest experience I'VE ever had, it truly is only for a temporary escape.  Skills such as Math and Reading become very very hard.  Focusing my eyes is also another problem that I face.  But none of those matter because nothing can phase me on a DXM high.  I am absolutely happy doing anything..  Doing homework, being at school, doing chores, or just sitting down in a park watching people and thinking for hours on end.", "I really hope that people aren't being all suicidal about this issue.  Sure, reality sucks, but that's the facts of life.  And if we were on DXM our whole lives (theoretically, that is) we would not be even as CLOSE to as intelligent people.  DXM is for Friday at school, for summer days, and for special times with friends.  I hope that it hasn't become a huge issue that leads to suicide.  I too was very depressed about this before, until I basically came to the realization that both lives that I have, the high life and the world life, are equally as awesome.  There are different aspects that make them great.", "I guess I'll go on to explain some instances with DXM because I see that I should include them.  Well, one time I went to a school conference.  My friend, possibly my best friend, just had his dad die of cancer and was having a really hard time on the bus.  I'd never seen him even come close to crying cause he's pretty much a bad-ass kinda guy.  Well, me, him, and my other best friend just totally ditched the conference.  Instead we went to the near Albertsons and got some DXM.  The rest of the day we walked.. and walked and walked and walked..Not knowing where we were going.  ", "Suddenly, it seemed as though we had accidentally stumbled upon our destination: a site that looked over a cliff with a picturesque view.  Not saying a word, we all just stared for about 20 minutes.  (20 minutes real time I think, it felt like at least 45)  We walked all the way back and, because we didn't have any concerns in our head, immediately found our advisors and told them where we were.", "We basically then just settled down in the same 10 feet of grass in the middle of nowhere and sat there for the rest of the day.  About 4 hours I think.  We just talked and ate and talked and didn't want to go anywhere else.  It seems like only on DXM can I get a true feeling of what contentment is.  I'm gonna end this letter right now although I have many many many more experiences to tell about.  My last parting advice..  When you're on a DXM high... LISTEN TO THIS SONG: Dj Jurgen - Better Off Alone.", "Thanks for putting up with my long letter.  Take care you guys, don't overdo it now, we're blessed to be in a time where we can get this legally; we don't need any crazy instances all over the news or anything.", "My friends and I have been using dxm (robotussin) for about a year and a half. When we started using it we would use it about twice a week.  In  the last six months we have only done it about 6 times. This is the story of my most extreme trip on dxm. We had planned on a 'robo trip' for about three days. We went and bought all the psycadellic equipment such as black lights, posters, etc. ", "We set up my apartment and drank 2 bottles of extra strength robotussin at about 8 pm. We waited for about an hour then it hit us.  At about 9:30 pm I started to feel a little sick to my stomache. I went to the bathroom to puke but never did. For the next hour I lay on my couch and tried not to think about puking. I think I may have fallen asleep for awhile but I cant be sure.  The next thing I remember I was in the bathroom looking in the mirror which was a huge mistake. I cant be sure of the time but i think it was about 11 pm.  ", "As I looked in the mirror many things happened to me.  The two that stick out in my mind were seeing my reflection covered in blood and then covered in shining metal plates. At this point I lost all control of my mind and body. I went and lay on the floor in the living room and closed my eyes. I saw the most intense hallucinations I have ever seen. I opened my eyes which did no good because my whole world had changed. All normal objects were tilted at wierd angles and every so often objects in the room would melt and drip to the floor. I would look at my friends and their faces would be different or sometimes blurry. I had a real hard time identifing them. They would talk to me and I wouldn't know who they were. ", "I wandered through my house which now seemed to me to look like a palace of some sort. I went into the kitchen only to find a huge swimming pool where the table was supposed to be. I was so lost I didn't know where I was. I couldn't feel any parts of my body and had trouble moving specific parts. I went back to the couch and lay there for what seemed like hours. I watched my house plant grow till it was about twice its original size. ", "The most intense part of my trip happened next. I was sitting on the floor when the wall I was staring at suddenly exploded. I was the only person in a room that seemed to be spinning through outer space. I watched stars and planets fly by me. I would say this lasted for about half an hour. When it stopped I was once again in my room sitting on the floor. I was astounded by what i had just seen. I went to the bed and lay down until I fell asleep. When I woke up I felt energized but very stiff and awkward.  ", "I have been 'robo tripping' for about a year and a half and never really had a bad trip.  Sometimes I will lose control and think I am never going to snap out of it. Just remember that it's all in your mind and try not to move around too much. I think this adds to the nervousness and confusion. Just sit back in a comfortable spot and enjoy the ride.  All in all I enjoy 'robo tripping', but be careful and try to have at least one person who is sober to trip-sit everyone. It really helps to have someone who is not tripping to talk to about what is going on with you.", "First, I would like to say that DXM is not a new substance to me, I've been using this for many and many trips and it's not as fun anymore. This was beyond a recreational dose and after a certain amount I just hit a delusional wall; I would like to share my experience meeting this wall.", "One night I had a small get together with some friends.  Only Marc and myself were up to using DXM.  Marc is an experienced user that I knew and trusted so we each took 700 mg.  Marc begins to feel it sooner than I do because he is an even lighter fellow then myself.  So, after fouty minutes or so, Marc starts jumping around and acting euphoric (something I can never feel under DXM's influence).  He begins to talk to everybody very empathetically and personally and he is dancing.  I begin to get angry at him because he is accidentally knocking stuff down and dropping things in my house.  Usually I would be happy for him that he is so ecstatic but he really bugged me.  He knew that I was upset and he sincerely apologized many times but I just get more and more angry at Marc.  Everything he said would make me wish he wasn't alive.  Well, my feelings were obviously DXM induced but the strange thing is, I never had such hostility under the influence and I didn't even know I was on it, I just thought it wasn't working yet.  I got so mad at the world I went down into my bedroom and took another 700 mg capsule.  'Fuck 'em' I thought.", "After 30 minutes of the second capsule I lay on the couch tired, knowing that if I went to sleep (common after using DXM too many times) that I would wake up into a delusional world.  I told Marc that I was afraid (I didn't really say it, it just seemed to slip out of my lips).  Marc got the people partying upstairs to come down and comfort me which I felt was highly unlogical seeing how I didn't really say that.  I must've fallen asleep because I didn't really know who I was for ten or so hours (although I was still feeling the effects 24+ after dosing).  I remember somehow managing to be in my bed around two hours after taking the second capsule.  I thought I was in a dark cave and I was figuring out something of the utmost importance.  For just two seconds, I realized I was on drugs (I didn't know what drug though) and that greatly soothed me, but I went back into that state again and I jumped out of my bed to tell everybody that I figured out the key to life, or something along those lines.  Next, I found myself lying on the couch staring at a Van Gogh print hanging on the wall.  It was stretched all strange and I didn't know who I was, what I was doing, the meaning of time, nothing.  I just stared at that painting and completely was lost in...God knows what.  I now know what an insane person feels and thinks.", "I woke up into a tiny midget house (common DXM effect, I was used to it) and went into the kitchen to get clues to who or what I was.  It was ten hours passed and the kitchen was swaying like a boat, back and forth, back and forth, my arms naturally moved to the rocking of the house.  This made my brother laugh, he was the only one home and he seemed twenty feet tall and five feet thick. He filled in the blanks on what time it was and so forth.  I was still messed up but at least I knew who I was...very relieving.  The next 15 hours I slowly came down and about 24 hours after the initial pill was ingested I was back to good ol' Sivvy Stilts. ", "It was eerie to know I was out that far yet I didn't know it. DXM is a scary substance for me; whenever I'm under its influences I feel there is something BEYOND, like when I went to church as a kid and they told me my soul would be in Heaven for eternity...think about that, ETERNITY!  I always think there is something beyond everything and it scares me. I probably won't do DXM over a gram again (no promises though). I decided that the wall of delusions is best left not slammed into 1400 mg per mile.", "I had done DXM twice--both about ten years ago, and recently decided to give it another go.  My mind had been feeling unusually cramped as of late, but being in Taiwan, I have no access to other, more 'conventional' mind opening substances.  I absolutely cannot drink cough syrrup--even the smell can summon my lunch--so after hunting around I found a medicine in capsule form called 'Noncough capsules S.T.'  Each capsule contains 20mg DXM, 90mg potassium cresolsulfonate, and 20mg lysozyme HCL.  ", "I researched the latter two ingredients, and was satisfied enough that they wouldn't kill me.  Still, to be on the safe side, I opted for a cautious dosage of 180mg (and after all, it had been a decade).", "It's my thinking that it was the capsules that messed everything up.  Well--let me say that it wasn't an unpleasant experience, just too drawn out.  It was like taking a very positive day-long experience and stretching it like a rubberband over the course of three days.  Or is there something about those other two ingredients I'm unaware of?  ", "I took the pills at 1 p.m. Sunday, and figured I would clean up my apartment and take a shower, and be all set in about an hour to welcome the effects.  As it turned out, the effects finally began to creep in at about 4 p.m., and slowly heightened throughout the evening.  It was a nice evening, a lot of free and loose thought, although with occasional bouts of restlessness where I would get up pace the floor for a minute.", "I can't remember when exactly I finally nodded off, but it took a while, and I was fortunate to have a light workload the following day.  I teach English to Taiwanese children, a job with which catatonia doesn't mix.  Several times I had students wave their hand in front of my glazed eyes.  Monday especially was a daze.  I was definitely still tripping, which at times was really cool because children can be very fascinating to study.", "Tuesday I was a little less out there--at the window looking in, perhaps--although I still couldn't eat much.  I have a very fragile appetite, so I've learned to just be patient and await that wonderful meal I'd have when the appetite returns.  I was, however, incredibly sleepy.  Sometime on Wednesday I suppose I finally felt normal.", "I doubt it's normal to go through a DXM haze for three days.  I'm considering opening the capsules and creating some sort of down-the-hatch concoction, but I'm nervous about having to trudge through another handful of work days if it ends up the same.  And, I'd like to do a higher dosage the next time.  Any comments?  In addition to input on capsules, I'd appreciate any knowledge about those two other ingredients.", "It was a lonely Sunday night. I called my friend ( we'll call him Stan) and asked him if he'd like to join me in a little DXM experiment. He and I had talked about it before, and I had done it before, first an 8 oz dose, alone. It scared me a bit, but it told me a lot (I won't go into details here). I had also done numerous 4 oz. doses, so I'm aware of the fact that these are like 2 different drugs.  Seriously.", "Anyhoo, the next day we went to the local drugstore and got him his own bottle (i had mine already). We went back to his house and downed it, each with a glass of water and some tums to kill the stomach pain. We hadn't eaten anythin and the familiar lucid-drunkness effects of plateau 1 hit me quick. This is where the trip took on it's pre-destined quality. My friend said his limbs were heavy and soon complained of nausea. I told him he wouldn't puke, fully knowing he would, and he did, eliminating a lot of the Robo. He also had the hot flashes, but no itching (thank god).", "Plateau 2 hit me within 45-60 minutes, and the music we were listening to took on a delayed, metallic echo, which seemed too deep, and I knew plateau 2 was rushing by. I kept changing seats in the room, from the couch, to a big soft beanbag chair, and the floor. My friend and I were definitely starting to communicate with each other thru body language and quickly uttered phrases.", "Every so often I would say, 'but the mirror', and run over to a small mirror on the wall. Stan would say 'really' and we'd go over and look at ourselves. This happened several times. Then my mind left very quickly and unexpectedly. We walked around the house and I had no control over what I said. It was like I would tell myself to say something, and the words would just flow from somewhere below my existant plane. It was pretty fun actually, just watching myself glide around.", "Soon we were back in the room and there were other people.  I thought 'surely this is a dream'.  Soon, I recognized the shapes of my other friends sitting in the room. I just sat, entertained by their motions and attempts to communicate with me.  I couldn't consiousely hear them, but I knew what they were saying.  Every now and then I would shut my eyes and see lines of stationary figures, or freeze framed scenes from earlier on that day.", "Then they decided to drive around, and took me with them. This was a big mistake, because DXM is a totally sensory altering substance.  I became disoriented with the movement. I didn't know it at the time, but I fell and slid down the stairs, and they had to carry me to the car. Once in the car I was in the deepest, most real dream of my life. Sitting there seemed so eternal. I accepted my fate that I had shattered some mental barrier and was to be trapped riding in this car for all eternity. But at least I was with friends.", "I remember trying to get out a few times to regain familiarity (something not to be done on DXM, because you can't.  I couldn't help it though, the setting was too out there. I'm convinced that it was being in the car that did it.)  We went back to the house and then me and stan were dropped off behind a school as the trip wore off. This had all happened before I realized. I had forseen it. The two of us, sitting by a fence on the ground, reconsructing the days journey. And I felt that it had happened for a reason too. Perhaps to strengthen our friendship, like a test almost.", "Later, I found out that I had attempted to leave the car about 5 times. 2 times were while it was in motion.  A few more times I actually made it out and lied down in the empty streets. It occured to me that maybe I was trying to self destruct, to escape the monotony and eternity of riding around forever in this tranced out state. My friends had dragged me back into the car several times. I realize now, that I had come very close to self destruction. But in this, upon recovery that night, and talking to my good friends later, I felt reborn, and still do. Again, this 'journey' had to happen. I honestly can't see it not happening.  And I thank my friends for their help along the path.", "As for why I went so entirely crazy, I do beleive it was the disorienting experience of being in a car for what seemed like ages. Even on my first, rather traumatic (and alone too) trip, I didn't try to escape from the state I was in.  I just thought i would try and show how this bizarre 'test' strengthened a bond between us all, and I warn others, STAY IN ONE SPOT. Thanks for listening.", "This was my first time going beyond 2p (the second plateau), which I`d done many many times before. I wanted to see some of the hallucinations that were reported with 3p DXM use.", "I can`t remember alot of what happend before the peak.. but somehow I had come into a weird 'mind-meld' with my computer and I couldn`t leave. I didn`t know who I was, I thought I had died and I had joined with god (my computer) or something. It was very weird. I typed everything I spoke automatically like it was second nature (I can`t type that good usually). As I came down I started to remember that I was a human being and my computer was not god and that I wasn`t dead.", "After that (very scary) episode I spent the rest of the time exploring my room and the hall and everything. My house had an unearthly feel to it, everything looked like a cartoon, full of crayoned color walls and stuff. I looked at some picture books of the Pacific NorthWest and watched people walking around in the cities and stuff (not tripping *as* hard at least).", "Finally I got tired and decided to go to bed. I think all that suger from the cough syrup kicked in and I had this huge rush. I was very restless and I don`t think I ever went to sleep until about 3am. ", "All and all, this was intersting.. but I don`t think I`d ever want to do it again. Losing identity seems to be common with lots of hallucinagins and people take it lightly, but now that I`ve actually experienced it I have a much deeper respect and it isn`t something I considered fun.", "I've always had many interesting experiences with DXM that I've wanted to submit to a website before, however, I think that my last one would be the best to share. Although I'm sure that many people might say this, I have been doing DXM longer then most people I meet who claim that they knew about it before anyone. Obviously it would be a bit absurd to claim that I am one of the originators of using DXM as a recreational drug, because from what I've read, it has been around for at least fifty years. However, I have been doing it for many years now, although I've abstained these last few weeks due to a rather unpleasant experience. ", "I know that I was definitely pissed off when I started dosing. Exactly how much I took I couldn't really say. At first it was like most trips, and quite enjoyable. I knew it would be a particular good night to do a lot, because I had no one around to distract me. My original plan was to lock myself inside a room and do all of the things that DXM makes enjoyable. As I was waiting for the full effect, I was laid out in front of my TV. After some time passed, I realized that I had probably taken more then intended. Once I realized this, I continued to go up. I made one attempt to leave the room in hopes that I would realize that I wasn't tripping that bad. Unfortunately, I opened the door, saw darkness, I got frightened. I couldn't do any of the enjoyable things that I had planned, I was stuck in front of my TV and couldn't move. The particular show that I had on apparently was not a good one, I remember there being a lot of death, and after that my memories start to get very distorted. Most I'm sure I cannot remember. I made one more attempt to leave the room, only this time, I somehow returned with the belief that I was not an actual human, and was starting my metamorphosis back to my true alien form. How long this lasted, I cannot say.", "At some point I wound up back in front of the tv. At this point, I started to panic, realizing that it was not turning out to be a pleasant experience at all. That was then confirmed when I had a visit from my best friend, my former trip partner, who just so happened to die a year ago. I thought that he had come for me, that I was going to join him, and God was there as well to help me transition. At this point I could barely breathe, and felt that my heart would burst at any minute. I panicked, thinking that it would be too painful leaving my body. I thought to call 911, but realized that someone had tipped the EMT's off about how it was meant for me to die that day, and they would provide no help. I ran around the house in a panic, trying to think of how to cheat death, and at some point I must have unknowingly called 911.", "Suddenly there were cops in my room, along with my brother who apparently had been in the next room the whole time. I got the oxygen mask and made my way to the ambulance, where my blood pressure was taken and came out as 60/25. In the hospital, hooked up to the heart monitor, my pulse would jump from as high as 165 to as low as 30 in a minute. If you think that this could not be possible, neither did i. Fortunately I did not die that night, and have not attempted to do any DXM since. The bad part is that I still think that death is coming for me, and am convinced that someone is after me. These are not normal thoughts for me, I've never been a paranoid person, unless drug induced. Unfortunately, my last trip has seemed to have had some very lasting effects on me. I really hope that my story will be used. As I already said, I have been using DXM for years, but now will most likely never touch the stuff again.", "I'll admit, after I realized that I was going to live, I did think that it was one of my best trips, I got to ride in an ambulance, I was hooked up to machines, only someone who has done DXM can understand how that could be a fun experience. However, memories of that last time are still coming back, and it terrifies me now to think of that. For every reason that I've always enjoyed doing DXM, I now hate. I realize that some probably prefer to read the more glamorous stories, but this type of shit is what people should really be reading. Death was right there, I could see it, and now I don't think of having a fun time as getting as fucked up as possible and seeing if I'll die. People might do DXM, and not care what happens to them, but you can't really comprehend what it really means to die unless you see it right there.", "I was with a friend in a CVS one day, and I decided to pick up a bottle of CVS tussin, not only because it's the thinnest kind of cough syrup, but because I was convinced to give DXM another try after I learned the reason my last trip sucked was because I used Coricidin.  I decided that I would save it for a special night which gave me reason to use 700 mg of DXM. And here's how it went.", "I invited Kevin to spend the night, and decided to treat him to some cannabis I would order later.  When he came over we started watching some TV after he socialized with my family.  We called up the dealers, and I thought this night would call for a little something more than weed: DXM. After telling Kevin my trippy plans, I went into my bathroom. I set up a clear glass with 8 ounces of Tussin, a glass of water, and a newly opened can of Coke.  From experience, I know that Coke will settle my stomach, and give my mouth a better taste. I pinched my nose tightly and chugged the glass of Tussin as quickly as possible. I felt it make me sick as it went down. Continuing to hold my nose, I washed it down with water, then a little bit of Coke.", "I went around my basement for the next half hour trying to walk off my stomach ache, sipping Coke as to try to take mind mind off of it. Occasionly, I would bend over, positive that I would hurl but I never did. At T+45 minutes, after 30 minutes of nausea and not regurgitating once, the effects came on.", "We met the dealers outside my house.  The world was red.  I was getting a low head-rush high.  We went back in the house and I felt really disoriented.  Everything was slowed down, and shaky.  We went into my media room to watch 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire', and my dad sat next to me, so I was trying to keep a hold of myself.  I got the courage and stability to stand up and ask Kevin up to my room.  On the way up I briefly asked my mom to get my dad out of the basement. When I got up to my room, I sat down on my bed, because it was the best thing I could do, I felt exhausted.  Kevin went into my bathroom to pick the seeds out of the sac.  In the meantime, I was tripping nuts!  The walls were turning darker and caving in, and red mushrooms from the Mario game were spinning around my ceiling fan.  It took me a minute to tell my brother what I was seeing, because DXM slows my motor skills drastically.  We then decided to go back down to the basement at T+1:30.", "I sat down on the couch, and was seeing horizontal squiggly lines of fire in a pattern.  There were closed eye visuals that were relevent to things I've seen before, like mathematical equations on my teacher's markerboard.  I would occassionly close my eyes involuntarily, due to the drowsiness.  I would watch Kevin talk to my brother and not even care what they were saying.  The effects were picking up even more!", "At T+2:00, I couldn't even control myself.  I called another friend on his cell and tried to talk, but my thoughts took me forever to express.  I took my attention off the Goldeneye game Kevin was playing; it was disturbing to see such agitation.  I sat on the couch, and I felt like I was going to die that night.  My right side of my neck felt much larger than the left side, so I thought I busted an artery in my neck.  I asked my sister if one side of my neck was larger, and she said yes!  This wasn't true, of course, but sure as hell scared me.", "When my parents went to bed, at T+3:00, some real heavy feelings began.  I thought there was a worm in each of my temples because they were beating crazily.  I was invited to go outside to smoke some weed and decided to lead the way.  On the way to our destination, I felt like I was mentally retarded for life.  I felt as though it had always been that way, and will always be forever.  This is no joke, this is an important part of DXM behavior, assuring myself of being something I'm not.  My friend at school told me he was sure he was a gopher for life.  I asked my brother and Kevin if they noticed my speech impediment.  They told me no, but I was convinced I had a heavy one.  We went far, probably 1/4 mile (far to me), onto a golf course path.  It was winter, and we settled down on the snow.", "While Kev and my brother were lighting up their bowls, I was phasing out.  I would totally forget about where I was, who I was, or anything having to do with my surroundings.  I would fly into space, basically.  This happened whenever I closed my eyes.  It's like tuning in and out of reality.  I took two bowl hits that didn't really do anything, I guess the large dose of DXM cancelled out the weeds effects.", "I got back home at T+4:00 sat back on the couch and saw some weird closed-eye visuals like a man in a helmet using a camcorder.  I felt really disoriented, like I was falling apart and was POSITIVE that I was going to die.  My neck blood pressure was ticklishly high, like my temples were.  I passed out after the glorious patterns of red skulls came and went.", "The next morning I woke up cross-eyed, having to re-adjust my eyes to focus in on objects, and was on a day's hangover, having a hard time talking to Kevin's mom, until smoking some trippy cannabis the next night.  My DXM trip was absolutely unforgetable.", "I have experimented with Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough for over a year now, and I would like to relate my findings.", "     I am not currently under the effects of DXM.  My girlfriend did not like the dramatic changes that manifested in my personality.  I did.  Argument ensued.  I decided to quit.", "     I learned about DXM at a small party in the spring of 1999.  Up until then the only drugs I had used were pot and acid, the latter only once.", "     The person that told me about it was mentioning it as an alternative to acid, which I had been looking around for for the longest time with none in the area to be found.", "      This person was misinformed though about the stuff.  I went home though and did my research on the internet, and found out that RMSC was the stuff I wanted, not the Max cough and cold.  ", "       This person also had told me that it made you hallucinate by eating the lining of your stomach, somehow causing the effects.  This was nonsense.", "        I've experimented downing it in a number of ways.", "Dose cup by dose cup, chugging the bottle, chugging and drinking a bottle of water, dosing alternating with grapefruit juice shots.  I have not found any difference in what ultimately happens, except with the water.", "        The effects are cumulative, and increase in enjoyablity as you adapt.  You the reader could go out right now and buy a bottle for five dollars and chug it and experience very little to nothing.  But if you did that everyday for a week to a week in a half, using your best judgement, you would begin to notice a DEFINITE change in your thinking and actions.", "      Negative thoughts could not penetrate my calm mind, my upbeat mind, nor my sleeping mind.  DXM is a euphoriant, so that is why.  Again though, it's cumulative, so don't expect anything without experimenting.", "      At first I had no idea what I was doing.  None whatsoever.  But the substance has a way of correcting your behavior in terms of how you find out what works and what doesn't.  ", "        I don't know how it works, but the water somehow prolongs the effects up to 6-7 hours. Actually plain water is the best thing I have ever taken with DXM.  Not mixed or anything...just afterwards.  I would always drink bottles and bottles of water because I was being cautious with my kidneys.  It is a syrup, and it's being dumped into your system wholesale.", "Dosing too high for being in public (anything over 4 oz for my body weight)", "Not being able to concentrate for a period of time, usually less than two minutes.  This occurs probably two hours into my experiences.", "Heavy nausea, accompanied by vomiting and not being able to keep anything on my stomach.", "Gradual loss of my ability to walk decently while being on it.  I have gone to stand up from chairs and had to sit immediately back down in embarrassment because no one knew I was on it.  If I would have gone to walk, they would have been able to tell something was definitely up.  This occurs generally towards the end of the trip.", "Conflicts with my loved ones, who have no idea what sustained, controllable euphoria actually feels like, nor how dramatically it alters your self-image.", "Constantly wanting more to prolong the effects.  Bottoming out can be avoided..there is no coming down unless you can't find a bottle, and even then the residual effects can last upwards of a week.  Two to three days is more common in my experience.", "Again, most of these effects occur when you don't know what you're doing, when you think you have control of the drug and not the other way around.", "Some of the positives, and I am leaving out the psychological aspects, which are profound:", "    Diminishing of physical pain. This helps in all kinds of things.  Use your mind and experiment.  I find stretching to be extremely pleasurable, and I could stretch easily beyond my non-DXM zones.", "    Inability to achieve orgasm (unless you're definitely persistent and tenacious), coupled with a dramatic increase in the enjoyable qualities of sex.", "    An increase, after an initial orientation with, ESP.", "    The ability to talk to anyone anywhere, unabashedly.", "There is a lot more.  This was the tip of the iceberg with my experience.  It's really sad that others can't see the difference between use and abuse, as they label anything they are scared of or ignorant of as abuse.", "The experience that I had on a relatively small dose of DM was after careful study of the DXM faq by William White. I had done about ten other trips on DM using different doses usually regulated with marijuana. ", "It was about nine at night when my roommate and I took about seven or eight pills containing 30 mg each. I smoked some pot about an hour and a half later and was beginning to feel the usual effects. The set and setting were planned and we usually just listened to ambient type music and drifted in space.", "The strangeness came over me in waves and it felt as though I had just climbed onto some kind of a vehicle that I knew was going to crash. I am involved with other energy type training such as chi gong and what I experienced can be described somewhat under that paradigm. Waves of energy came up my spine from my groin and exploded out the top of my head and I then had to go out side to somehow ground myself. I went outside and energy pulsed through my entire body, blew out my hands and head in two huge waves and it felt as though I had died and been reborn. That was not the case. I was then somehow relieved and went back into my basement. ", "This is where it got weird. I sat down and at the exact second that I did, I stood up and started to walk up the stairs to go outside again. This time, totally against my own will. I remember talking to myself inside my head saying 'this is from space'. I could not control what my body was doing and it scared me. I continued to be freaked out inside myself and went outside, did the pulse thing again and on the way back downstairs I realized what had happened. Or so I thought. I had died, my body was still in the basement and I was going to do this loop of going outside and exploding into the universe, again, and again and again. This is when it wasn't so liberating. I thought of the paramedics finding me, my fiance getting the call that I had overdosed etc. All of these thoughts went through my mind and it was only my second trip up the stairs. ", "I went back downstairs and sat on the bed waiting for it to happen again. I stood up and was trying to do all that I could to not walk up that staircase again. I stood up and started spinning around in circles and this is when my roommate asked what was wrong. I was so fucking glad that I wasn't walking up the stairs again I couldn't talk. I did a lot of stuff repeatedly to convince myself that I was back and alive, like turn the light on and off to prove that I could act on the world and it would react. ", "I then spent the next month or so trying to figure out what happened. I didn't know if I was lying there the whole time or if I had been in my body that was walking around and couldn't control it. Still don't know but it made me really glad that I was alive. I have since done more meditation and martial arts than DXM and taken the experience to heart. It is sometimes not so good when something more powerful than me can generate slowly in my body, surges through it instantly. It may have been that aliens came and got me if I was in another frame of mind. At the time there were not these kinds of places to read about this stuff so I submit this to try and give someone freaked out some peace of mind.", "My little adventure began sometime around 12:30 at night. I had bought an 8 oz bottle of tussin maximum strength cough medicine. This was my second time robo-tripin, actually more like my fifth, but the first few times I didn't know what I was doing. I am one of those extremely rare people that actually like the taste of cough medicine. A few times when I had a cold I had knocked back more of the nyquil night time formula than I was supposed to. I liked the floaty detached feeling I got before I fell asleep. Then I got on the internet and found out that people actually slam this stuff. I can't say that I'm surprised. People will do any thing to get off.", "I had researched my dosages and decided that 8 oz should be enough to get me to the third plateau, but not enough to be dangerous. I was interested in the reports of OBE's that people have experienced on that level. I'd been trying to have an OBE on and off ever since I'd first read about them when I was twelve. So far I'd gotten no joy.", "I sat drinking my 8 oz of syrupy goodness while watching an old black and white movie. It was the generic brand so it wasn't as thick as regular robo. I had it finished in about 10 mins and didn't have a problem keeping it down. I finished watching my movie and waited for the robo to kick in. I was in my room, where I planned to spend my trip. My mother was in her room, but I knew that would not be a problem as long as I kept it down. I'm 26 and she pretty much ignores everything I do. I set up my 5 disc cd player with some cool tunes, turned my hallogen lamp to its lowest setting and plugged in the headphones. I was set.", "It kicked in at around 1:30 about an hour after I had taken it. I felt a bit lightheaded and everthing had taken on a brightness that hadn't been there a moment before. I put on my earphones and entered tussin conciousness. The music was exquisite, moving through me with a power reminiscent of ecstasy. I could hear every nuance. No, I had heard these sounds before, but now I noticed every nuance. I lay down in the semi-darkness surrrounded by shadows, and stared at the faces caught in my textured ceiling.", "For a moment there was nothing, only darkness and the sounds coming through my headphones. Then slowly, the world took shape around me. My mind, in a creative leap, was taking ideas, feelings, associations and whatever else from the music and turning them into images. The inside of my head was like some bizarre music video. And I'm not talking daydreams. I always think of daydreams taking place somewhere in the back of my mind underneath the images that I receive from the daytime world. No, I'm talking you are there. Welcome to Tussin Space. It's everything that VR was always cracked up to be, but never was. ", "My body was not there at all, I was simply a spark of awareness moving through this mindscape. I remember moving through a house filled with broken dolls. The ceiling was very low and the walls were painted in a vivid dark blue that looked bumpy and peeling. Depeche Mode was playing and my mind moved in time to the music, turning corners on beat and zooming in and awayy to fit the feel. A swell in the music suddenly lifted me away from those rooms and twisted halls and sent me flying through the ceiling and over the roof. I flew low over rooftops, then trees and then into the side of a mountain, where I slid through totally unreal looking tunnels. Everything looked like CGI.", "Instantly I was back on my bed staring at the wall. Things were looking a little blurry and messed up, but undeniably real. It makes me feel cold and alone to open my eyes to the real world. I pulled up the blanket to warm me but soon tossed it off again. The coldness I felt had very little to do with body temperature and more to do with feeling shakey and confused. I closed my eyes again and I was back in my own little world feeling safe and secure. For me, there are no questions in Tussin Space, there are only images and movement. It's like lucid dreaming. You move through Tussin Space knowing that it is Tussin Space and that you are just a blink away from the real world.", "Around 3:30 I turned my light up and started to move around. It was hard getting to my feet. My legs wanted to collapse underneath me. I took a step and it felt like I was floating. I took each step with exagerrated caution like I'd forgotten how to walk. If I turned my head too fast I got dizzy. Somehow I made it to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and my eyes were wide and staring. My pupils were huge. My hair was a mess. I looked totally fucked up. I decided not to look in the mirror anymore. I did my business and walked through the rest of the house being extra quiet so as not to wake my mom. Soon I got tired of that. The floating effect is cool. but not as cool as the music. Tussin Space was calling me back.", "I stayed listening to my music until about six which is when Bauhaus came on. Suddenly my world wasn't so cozy and safe anymore. Normally I love Bauhaus, but now that goth band was way too dark and depressing. This was when my night turned from a great trip to a bad trip.", "I turned off my stereo and got back into bed intending to get some sleep. Yeah right. I just lay there in bed watching the walls getting brighter and brighter as the sun came up. My vision was totally fucked. The walls seemed twisted in some wierd way. My room was quiet now that the music had been turned off and there was a bubble of apprehension inside of me that grew to fill the silence. That shakey/alone/confused feeling was back only stronger this time. I lay on the bed listening to my heart beat. It seemed to be pounding along way too fast. My skin felt itchy and tight and extremely hot. I took off my shirt and laid there in my panties wondering if I was going to have a heart attack. An hour dragged by, one of many slow, drawn out hours. I was waiting for the effects to wear off and they just weren't. My breathing was fast and shallow. I worried about falling asleep. What if I stopped breathing. By this time I was extremely scared, and not thinking straight at all. I thought about dialing 911. I thought about waking my mother. I played those scenes out in my head and they looked bad. My mother would get me to a hospital, but the hospital would call the police. That would be VERY BAD.", "I thought about dying, slipping away from the real world forever. Would I enter Tussin Space for good? Or would I just be erased like I never existed. The possibility of this had never really bothered me before. What's one more human more or less. I've always recognized that anyone of us could kick off for good at any given moment. Life is fragile. Deal with it. Well it began to bother me now. The idea that I might suffer a massive cardiac arrest and die at any second had me in a petrified funk. I'd be here one second breathing, thinking, living and then the next I would cease to exist. No more sunny days, no more beautiful music, no more me. My mind was paralyzed with indecision. I finally decided to stay where I was because a)I had reseached dosages before hand and 8 oz should not be a lethal dose b) I had told myself that I should stay in the room no matter what and c) it was the easiest thing to do.", "By ten I managed to slip into an extremely shallow sleep. I dreamt that there were two men and a woman with me in my room. The woman was in some kind of uniform and she was sitting by my bed taking my blood pressure and temperature. The two men were talking about how I was dying and there was nothing they coud do. The woman was saying reassuring things, but she also seemed to think I was dying. This was almost like a hallucination that I was slipping in and out of. I opened my eyes many times convinced that they were there with me. When I realized that they weren't I felt more lonely than ever. By 1pm I was no longer afraid of dying. My biggest fear was that I had damaged my brain and that I would stay like this forever. My thoughts were still really confused and my vision was fucked up. Everything now looked stretched out and at kind of at an angle to me. I staggered to the bathroom and my pupils were still dilated. I returned to bed and thought about killing myself. I felt that I couldn't handle it anymore. The vision of blood pouring from my vein filled my mind over and over again. I had to be at my part-time job at 5pm and I'd never be able to do it like this. I wasn't even sure that I had enough coordination to call and tell them I coudn't make it. This seemed like an insurmountable problem to me.", "By 3pm my vision had mostly cleared up and I was thinking a lot more clearer. By 4pm I was still a little shakey, but basically ok.", "My trip lasted about 13 hours. I thought that it would only last 8 hours at the most. I guess the moral to this story is every trip has the potential to be different. Sometimes the body metabolizes substances slower than at other times. Also you should probably consider a sitter with you in case you freak out.", "I'll probably try it again. I'm still hoping for an OBE.", "I would just like to express a brief note of caution. Although regulations require medical products to list the medical ingredients of their product, in Canada they won't neccesarily put the 'buffer' chemical on the list. This buffer chemical is the one that makes you throw up violently if you accidently ingest 'too much' to stop little kids from accidently killing themselves (or adults too, I suppose). Of course, if you're using a chemical recreationally then this buffer will almost certainly get in the way. ", "This may be why a number of people have reported ill effects from cough remedies which _appeared_ to contain only DXM. I have personally used DXM with no undesirable effects several times, then, after switching brands (to the generic one none the less!) I became violently sick and had uncontrollable diarheah when taking a trivial dose (300mg DXM HBr) I guess the moral of the story would be to try out a new brand at low levels and see if you can feel evidence of a buffer before subjecting yourself to 5-6 hours of nausia and delerium.", "I tried DXM for the first time in nov 1997.  Ever since that date my life has not been the same.", "1st time: the first time i got high i drank about 6 oz of tussin and took 8 cold caps (i don't know the brand).  I was with 2 of my friends in a treehouse and I never thought anything would actually happen, but after about 30 min I started feeling pretty disoriented.  The distortion of time is very interesting.  What seemed like 20 min (3 hours). later we tried to climb out of the treehouse and could barely walk.  Later that night as i was falling asleep i would inhale and wouldn't exhale for about 15-20 seconds later.  The high lasted until the next morning and that whole week in school my visual perception was not the same.

The fireworks were cool, but after they would explode we could still see them in the air.  ", "present:  my point is that ever since that night in 97 my visual perception has never gone back to normal, or what i think normal should be.  When i am not high i get tracers on everything from glowsticks to my own hand... even not doing pills for 3 months in a row hand no effect correcting my perception.  I have gotten into a sick cycle: i believe that this perception of reality is not normal, so i do pills, coming down from them brings me back here, so it feels normal again, but after a month or so things are so unreal again that i have to take pills again to remind myself i'm not crazy.", "mabye i'm just psycho or something, but the truth is that my perception is eternally fucked up, so be careful.", "-talk normal, but occassionally say something that is out of the norm", "-snap in front of their face and it will take them about 2 seconds and they'll react", "Let me start this by saying that DXM is THE drug.  Nothing compares to the experiences you have while tripping on DXM.  I've taken many different drugs with many different effects, but DXM is so much more than a drug and, in my opinion (and others I trip with), shouldn't be referred to as a 'drug` for it is so much more than that to which it is referred as.  Anyway, onto the major reason of writing this: to share my experiences with DXM.", "  It was a while ago, while I was only into drugs like weed and shrooms and shit like that.  My friend told me about Dextromethophan, or DXM, and about it's effects.  After I heard about this 'drug`, we went up to Walmart and got a few boxes of Coricidin Cough and Cold, which is what we take to trip when we don't have straight DXM capsules.  The only bad part about tripping off Coricidin Cough and Cold is the sick stage in which you feel nauseous, which occurs about 15 to 20 minutes before the DXM starts to kick in.  This is the only side-effect I've experienced.", "  Anyway, we took a box each, which is exactly 16 tabs each.  After about an hour, the sick stage came in effect, but went away after about 15 minutes and then my trip began.  I saw my life from many different points of view.  Looking over my life, I saw many things I did wrong and should've avoided doing.  After looking over myself many times over, I gained a certain knowledge and wisdom from my mistakes, as well as shit I did right.", "  Then the trip went in a totally opposite direction: I was witnessing my future, rather my futures.  I saw multiple futures of what was to become of me, and what had caused each of them.  I gained even more knowledge about myself and about my future.  Through DXM I was able to see what would become of me depending on the path I chose.  My trip hit full force about an hour later, and I was aware of everything around me and everything not.  I felt people's emotions just by speaking with them.  It was like I gained a bond with everything and everyone around me.", "  I also knew most of what people were going to say before they spoke a word.  I proved this as I sat there by my cousin speaking exactly what he spoke in precise unison with him.  He didn't buy into this phenomenon at first, but as I kept speaking his words with him, he was amazed.  I should've been amazed as well, but I knew that was just scratching the surface of what was possible while tripping.

I have acquired much wisdom and insight on many things I would've never been able to if I hadn't of tripped on DXM.  DXM may be considered just a drug, but to those who have been matured and reconfigured by DXM, it is a gateway to a total personal awakening and a reconstruction of your mind and the way you react to things that may have seemed meaningless before, but could potentially be key items during your life.

Since the red pills were ingested whole, the effects took well over an hour to first manifest.", "First of all, dis ain't no psychedelic. Obviously. It was definitely psychedelic-like, and I can see why some people might enjoy experiencing this drug, but it didn't really seem like my cup of tea. The dissociative high was like existing as a point suspended in infinte space with no memory of my body or external reality, which was an interesting sensation and could be considered euphoric under the right conditions. Or, rather, that's how I would imagine, say, an IM dose of ketamine to be. My dosage was not sufficient to provoke a complete dissociation, although there was a definite feeling that my mind was *here* and my body was *there*; it was easy to lose track of the location of my limbs, for example, and I picked up hints of the fully dissociated mindstate, making me more than a little curious about ketamine experiences. But all in all, it seemed to me like a sort of escapist (in the pejorative sense of the word) version of the psychedelic high, although I do not mean by that to assert anything other than *my own* opinion of its usefulness *to me*.

I had trouble getting my eyes to focus on things. Getting the LED display of a clock to resolve into numbers was a chore. The visual sensation was of trying to focus on something when having just gotten off a merry-go-round. Walking (or anything requiring muscle coordination) was extremely difficult in my dream. I felt like brain and body were, well, dissociated. :-)", "The next day, I had a *terrible* hangover that lasted well into the afternoon. I felt like brain and body were now 'misaligned' after their separation. I could function, but I felt stupid, clumsy, self-conscious, and altogether uncomfortable.

I'm no expert at drugs, I will attest. I rarely drink, and have smoked MJ even more infrequently (like, oh, 5 times total in my life...) I have been around people who have done drugs. Usually I was the 'designated straightedge.'

Loved it, since my roomie is deathly afraid of the stuff. He used to do it, and now can't even get near a bottle of the stuff without heaving. Drank the whole 4ozs in front of him in about 2 minutes, and made sure to breathe the fumes on him :) Not a whole lot of effect, but I did not really expect much. Some dizziness, a little bit of audio hallucinations (music was a whole lot more interesting...) I was more talkative, but always felt like I was slurring my speech (even though, according to my friends, I was not.) Time seemed to move really slow. The high lasted about 4 hours, even though it felt longer. Felt tired, worn out afterwards and slept rather well...", "2nd Time: Drank another 4oz of Rob-DM. Licked my lips as my roomie gagged at the sight of me drinking it (unlike others, I do not mind the taste of Robitussin too awful much, although I do have to drink plenty to get the lingering taste out of my mouth...) Much the same effects as before, but even more pronounced. No real visual-hallucinations at all. Lasted a bit longer this time, maybe 5 hours. Loads of fun walking around. Next to impossible to urinate, though :)", "3rd Time: Decided to be cheap, and bought a bottle of generic Hy-Vee Brand 'Tussin.' Ingredient label was EXACTLY the same as Robitussin DM (I made sure to check.) Got back, drank it all in 3 mighty gulps. Taste was AWFUL! I could feel my guts beginning to churn. I sat back, waiting a bit for the effects to take hold (usually takes about 45 minutes when I drink a whole bottle at one time..) A friend came in and told me they were dragging someone up on the memorial arch at school (a big 50 foot monument to something), so I rushed out there. I helped drag him up by pulling a rope that was slung over the top, and had to do a lot of strenuous pulling. I got violently sick, and threw up in the snow by the arch. After about an hour and a half outside, I still felt no effect. Went back in and went to sleep. Absolutly no effects. Felt cheated.", "4th Time: Another 4oz Robitussin. Even more effects than before. Began to get into the 'oh WOW!' type syndrome. Everything became INFINATELY more interesting. I'd tend to stare off into space without blinking for moments at a time. Began having minor hallucinations, too. Posters and things on the wall would seem to jump and change places just a little bit. Slight visuals too, like a flashing off-color light field in front of my eyes for moments at a time. Lasted even longer, about 6 hours, and time felt really, really distorted. I awoke the next morning full of energy, too.", "5th Time: BIG TIME. Decided to go all out, and bought the 8oz Family Size Robitussin DM. Drank it all within 10 minutes (to the absolute DISGUST of everyone in the room.) Kind of a mistake, but not really. It began like normal, dizziness, then audio-hallucinations, then slight visuals. But it continued on. I began to have more massive visuals. Big colored blobs flowing and oozing in front of my eyes. Staring at any one spot for awhile caused that spot to seem to fly away, almost like I was shrinking. My friends left me alone for awhile, and I sat in the room in the dark. More hallucinations, including one full-blown, 'I do not exist, anymore'-type hallucination. I thought I was a flower. I could feel myself swaying the wind, I could see a big field of grass instead of my normal surroundings. This went away rather quickly, and has been the only real, full-out hallucination I have had yet. I was full of energy, too. I was hyper. I was bouncing off the walls in our hallway, running around, talkative. When I finally sat down, about 6 hours later, I was still buzzing. I began to get tired, and started sort of passing out. During that time, I began convulsing. I'd all of a sudden get sort of a seizure, and flail around in the chair I was sitting in. That lasted about 45 minutes, until I fell fully asleep. Awoke nice and refreshed the next day.", " 6th Time: I was kind of hesitant to do any more after the last experience, but I eventually downed another 4ozer (of Rob-DM). Not a whole lot, just a normal 4oz trip. I might have been holding myself back because of the experience I had with the 8ozer.", "7th Time: Another 8oz Family Rob-DM. Great time. I had all the effects I had before on the 8oz, but no adverse side-effects. I was loaded with energy. The trip lasted at least 10 hours, and I was buzzing the whole time. Finally fell asleep, and woke up the next morning feeling good, but a little bit messed up still. This was probably the longest trip I have ever had on Robitussin yet.", "8th (and most recent) Time: Decided to make a change, and picked up the Maximum Strength Robitussin 4oz. Drank it all in the normal 3 big gulps. Wow. I wasn't filled with as much energy as before: I couldn't bounce around as much and stuff. But the buzz, and the visuals, and everything was just the same as drinking 8oz. I had some wild visual hallucinations. For awhile, it felt like I was walking around only in 2-dimensions. Everything had length and height, but no width. Wild... The next day I was violently ill, though. I think this had more to do, though, with the fact that I was coming down with a cold all weekend, and not the Robitussin.", "Will I do it again? Probably. I have heard a lot about the similarity between DM-trips and LSD & Shroom-trips. I would consider trying them(LSD, Shrooms), but they are near to impossible to come by in Ass Backwards, IA where I am attending College. So you can bet I might be making a few more trips to the local supermarket for that (ahem) bad cold I got. I don't really condone the stuff. It may sound great, but there are plenty of bad effects. If you have a weak stomach, or can't handle the smell of Robitussin, then for god sakes DON'T. You'll puke. Only reason I can handle the stuff is because I kind of like the taste (strange, I know, but I still complain to my roomie that it tastes better than the Millwaukee's Best Light beer he loves to drink...) If you are depressed, or have an adversion to drugs, then for christ sakes, DON'T! If you have to drive, or work, or anything strenuous, then for satan's sake, DON'T!

Listened to music in the dark and had a pretty good time singing along. Now I popped in Nirvana's Nevermind. It was more melodic and cooler to listen to.

He told me to stop shaking them (By now he seemed pretty fried too) and when I stopped (It was fairly hard, I couldn't quite remember 'how' to). It felt weird stopping, so I just let them shake (They stopped when I laid back down). Standing up was hard and so was talking (although that didn't stop me).

I can only remember a few of the milder ones, but I know I told him things about myself I wouldn't tell ANYONE normally... Luckily our memories of the experience are very bad, and many of the things we told each other were absolute hogwash (I distincly remember 'Hey man, I gotta tell you something. I have sex with furniture' 'That's ok man, I have sex with guitars...').

Set sail upon a sea of trouble...but will hindsight reveal me simply adrift? I have a terrible feeling of ominous foreboding - the horizon is significantly darker than it appeared a decade previous.

I guess that at the very least it gives me a cause! I haven't marched since Palm Sunday and Michelle...all those years ago - younger, much younger...but now I'd mean it. Then it was simply the thing to do, newly immersed in tertiary idealism and freedom, it was right to express some political savvy and march for a cause, even if it was not truly grasped or understood. But even then it gave a feeling of belonging. I wore the 'No MX' badge proudly (in tandem with the 'Fuck off - I voted NDP' button) on my newest affectation, a climbing chalk bag. It's maternally warm within the clique even when, especially when, the slogans mouthed are not your own...but now I'd mean it. It's time to stand. Time to perform the surreal street theatre of death.

I worry that my statements aren't subtle enough to be attractive, but fear that in additional convolution the point may be lost. How does one present their issues and beliefs in a format sophisticated enough to attract support, but not so sophisticated that only I, Jung and Freud could grasp the underlying principles? Cliched? Aren't we all, but still...one must appease the critic within. I wonder would She (my mother, my ex's, Lara, Gaia, the Goddess - the feminine incarnations I have known) be proud? Is this an act of defiance, or merely the making of noise to fill the silence? I want to hold the flaming flag and burn the acrid, nylon flesh. Uncle Sam sit me on your knee and tell me another saccharin sweet lie wrapped within the guise of truth. What happened to those dead years in between history's momentous peaks?

Too many monuments, and always plenty of virgin marble for chiseling names, there's even room for foreign ones.

To do the right thing, or do the safe thing? I wanted to be Che before I even knew who he was. Is it true? Are we just a generation afloat, in limbo with no anchors or roots to the past. Is there any reality beyond the actual ink used to print our carefully recorded history?", "Where are the physical links? Did these things really occur, or is simply reading it, wishing enough? Why can't I scream? Are there no answers, merely the mocking lines of innumerable questions? And they won't go away, can't go away, because they're all we have. You old men marching, you left us with a syndrome solved only through sacrificial bloodshed, and now the maddened screams are internalised because our hands cannot be cleansed, and to cry out loud would only draw additional attention to our guilt. Lady Macbeth are we all - out, out, damned spot! Why must I carry the millstone burden of guilt for actions perpetrated by my forebears? Why they, theirs? We were all supposed to start out shiny and new, the proverbial unmarked page, but the old folks remember, and their bitter memories are osmotically absorbed by the young along with childhood's fairy tales. What chance did we have? What chance they? Hate is as virulent and insidious as any viral infection, yet we illogically fear the anthrax, and quaff the cup of hatred.

I thought that America had once more recalled the hazy memory of her constitution and joined in the fray, that the aquarian ideals weren't completely asphyxiated by 80's pecuniary infatuations. There are fragments of similarity out there, mirror reflections of self - they too fear, they too question. Why aren't there more? Old men once looked into childhood skies inhabited only by feathers and wind, whilst alien spacecraft are spotted by Islam's sons today, and blood is more readily consumed by sand than western soil. Desiccating desert winds preserve evidence of rage for future anthropologists to ponder. Global stockmarkets note the trade index of West versus Middle East, and today in Tokyo, the value of the Arab child dropped once more against the yen, whilst the price of a barrel of Saudi crude remained firm.

Mistakes appear randomly repetitive even on the global scale, and at a generational rate that allows us all the privilege of partaking in the same dead ashes as yesteryear. Strike the Jesus Christ pose and become martyr to yet another cause - at least that's modern accrual accountancy at work, recognising value added to a life of dubious worth. Perhaps the only value of these words is the beauty they dance across the page. Is a phrase any less valid if it says nothing of worth, yet pleases the eye or ear? Aesthetics? Some things are just wallpaper! Maybe my thoughts, ideas and various other emotional outpourings fit nicely into that niche. The curlicue of the question mark taunts me with it's repetitiveness across the page. Do I bring nothing to the table but the fathomless hungry maw? Nothing to help sate anothers appetite?

In retrospect, I would have been better served calling the Psychic Friends Network.", "It was 1 am. I was on my way to bed; I had been researching DXM on the web, and figured, what the heck. Previously I had not been in the best possible mind set for the last two weeks. The love of my life had left me saying that I was too intense for her, and she didn t want to be consumed. It was also about a month off from the anniversary of my father's death, and a mess of other angry-make events. I admit to being an adrenaline junkie, (ex NASCAR driver); but my most recent of two trips, gave me pause to re-examine my lifestyle. I had tripped a week before, on the same stuff, with a little less quantity, fairly uneventful, and actually pretty dull. The second time I had Massive Attacks newest on the juke box, and it was a cold and windy night. Not a cloud in the sky when I walked the dog around 10pm.

I had never even smoked marijuana before, and was a virgin extreme to altered states. I had just finished some Sam Adams, and was already a little woozy as I toddled off to bed.", "At 1 am, I chugged a bottle of Robitussin Maximum Strength, Cough and Cold, (354mg dosage, not a lot I know, [5ml per dose / 118ml in the bottle x15mg per dose]); I did not gag at all. I climbed into bed, turned off the lights, and waited. Within 30-45 minutes I was becoming nauseous, but having had to throw back some truly disgusting substances for my neurology, I knew could keep it down. About 15 minutes later the sickness passed, and I, feeling sort of drunk opened my eyes, to look for visual hallucinations. No such luck, so I closed my eyes, and rolled over thinking, screw this, just go to sleep . I could feel my thighs tense and relax, like a puppy in rem. I could hear the leaves rustling outside. Every car that went by outside, I felt like I was the car for a split second...Then I opened my eyes again, and found the ceiling, white, was shifting like it was liquid. This was the coolest thing I had ever seen. Big sigh. I found myself thinking about my girlfriend; I think I may have had an out-of-body experience, because I was suddenly in her bedroom in NC, while I knew My body was in NY. I was sort of swept along by my thoughts, and found myself crying over her as she slept. I kissed her on the neck, and was gone. Back to my room, I opened my eyes again, and felt a presence. It wasn t an elf, or an alien, or anything which I could make out clearly enough to identify. The shadows on the ceiling sort of came together to form a void mouth type thing. It saw that I had been crying and thought/asked if there was anything to be done. Before I thought/said anything else, It thought/said she'll be back, she misses you too . Once again I cried. It then started to rain outside, right on cue, and I knew then what/who I had been conversing with. I didn't fear it, but I started thinking, hey this is pretty cool, getting to meet god on your second trip. I then sort of got up, and robo-walked, (very, very odd) into the bathroom for the most wonderful piss of my life. The other odd thing about my jaunt to the can was that I didn't wake up the puppy. I felt such empathy for her, as she slept; I then had a flash, and I was the dog. So bizarre, so basic, so hungry, (the vet said that she was overweight, so I was cutting back on her food). I got her a biscuit, and laid it at the tip of her nose, and went back to bed. Crawling back to bed, this was odd, but I could swear that I was levitating, and just sort of slid onto the mattress. I then stayed awake until the sun came up, coming down; I had peaked at about 2:30-3:30am, and was feeling unusually beat. I fell asleep and woke refreshed and only had a mild hangover at about 1pm. I massaged my thighs in a hot bath to lessen the stiffness, and sit here in my bathrobe, writing this.", "I have also in reading the stories, faqs, and information on the web, have encountered a number of strange real-world phenomena with regards to my two trips. The first is the dimming of street lights in my presence. I can shut off all the lamps on Broadway, one after the next, within a 20-30 foot radius. As I pass by, the last one flicks back to life. The other thing worthy of note is that I think I shut off the coffee bean roaster, at my favorite local coffee house, until they took my order, and then blammo, back on. Really quite bizarre; the other thing that gave me pause to re-examine was after the first trip, I was sitting at a red light, but the green wouldn't turn on! From red to nothing...A sign to slow down my life now, before it s too late. One which I am heeding with great care.

I ll let you know if God was right about my fiancee.", "And all the reflective surfaces, all identifiable elements within my field of view, that impinge upon my consciousness, that insinuate themselves within my psyche, began to dislocate. They separated from, and lost the frame of reference that reality normally provided, they lose context and become surreal elements in and of themselves - they exude their inherent Huxleian 'isness'. Although my field of vision has discernibly narrowed, I have a growing awareness of a great region of possibility, a field of as yet unrealised probability existing within my peripheral arcs - I need but turn my head to look, to trigger the transformation and selection of a new reality, to determine life or death for Schroedingers cat with the merest glance, but do not for fear of disturbing my current reverie (1).", "Colour drains from all I survey, and an alien mechanical tone replaces it, a washed out shade of no discernible flavour.

My eyes close, I enter the internal realms, and am immediately confronted with the electric blue aurora borealis of the inner antipodes. Hazes of neon bright flora dance across the textured black distance in a perfectly choreographed harmony to Jean Michel Jarres Zoolook. I perceive motion, not just as a result of the movement before my eyes, but I can feel the gravitational ebb and flow that accompanies acceleration and changes in the directional vector throughout my being, and the movement and visuals are completely and integrally linked to the music swirling throughout (3).", "I determine to do more than smell the flowers and enjoy the ride, I would attempt to travel the road within that inner realm wherever it lead, whatever the outcome. I could feel the tension building, particularly in my jaw and neck, and sweat bead across my back as the intensity climbed. My body judders and teeth chatter - drugs may facilitate entrance into this cerebral nether world, but the grasping of answers is still bloody hard work! With the greatest, most objective amount of concentration I can still muster, I grapple with this new reality, try to force the myriad visions to reveal the path (4) - it is difficult to find, and easily lost within the fractured crystalline opalescence that surrounds me. The colours continually change and swirl within the nebulous organic mist (5), and that aspect of self that retains some semblance of detachment visualises travel along the contorted and convoluted synaptic pathways, through nerve ganglia and neural links that exist within the human mind, all the while being driven by the sounds around me.", "There was something that I was tracking - I became aware that there was indeed a goal toward which I plunged, an answer within to an as yet unarticulated question, only I was too weak, became distracted and lost my way. The path is not clearly signposted, it is in fact incredibly difficult to even identify, and there is so much to see and experience on the way to an unknown destination. Weathered stone tablets of a modern glyphic rather than the expected cuneiform, and tripartite sculptures of rippled black slate and electric blue-white glass were my downfall! (6).", "1. Movement is difficult. All of my limbs and components feel incredibly heavy and 'compartmentalised'. I know still that I could move, but the energy required to break the inertia of my current state would be enormous, and besides, I'm very comfortable as I am. Over time the state of dissociation accompanying this experience increases - I know that I have an arm, and I know that there is an arm above my head, but whether there is anything more than a coincidental link between those two statements is not known.", "2. The carpeting effect reminded me of a faded, dry, cricket pitch, green - not that it was, but it felt 'green' without necessarily being of that colour.", "3. Many drugs affect the electrical messages sent to and from various parts of the brain, primarily those pertaining to visual information. Messages from any of the senses can be perceived as merged together, creating a sensation known as 'synesthesia.' This most commonly is represented as 'hearing colors' or 'seeing sounds.' Definitely what was occurring.", "4. Much like within a lucid dream. As a child I would have lucid dreams quite regularly, and quickly learnt to manipulate the dream state, much like directing your own movie. It was sometimes hard work then, and it was definitely hard work this time.

There were other inhabitants within this realm occupying the very edge of consciousness. Many cloudy, dissipating faces were seen during travels, inner demons that would tear substance from the aurora with which to form themselves and then just as quickly dissolve back into the background swirls. Skeletal horseman within a flowing, golden, gelatinous river, contrived and constructed of the very liquid in which they existed, and only discernible in profile, against the darkened distance.", "6. My concentration lapsed, and the question of art entered my mind. I got caught up in thoughts of object d'art that were weathered stone tablets, very old, very much damaged by wind and sand, fractured, broken, reminiscent of the Rosetta stone, but containing 'valid' texts from Hunter S. Thompson, or the chemical data and molecular structure of LSD 25. Along with this was the tripartite sculpture...Three large slabs of black textured slate of decreasing width, but constant height and depth (maybe 9 feet high). The major pillar had a non representational swirl of electric blue-white glass melted into its surface, an abstract form but with inherent significance. The swirled form overlapped partially onto the second, smaller, and stepped back slab, and then only a few vague lines onto the third. (I think I may have to actually make these items - maybe...can glass be melted and merged with the surface of black slate?)", "I am very tired, as I have had a long night of insomnia, but my sleeplessness was caused by reasons that I need to start to alleviate now.

There is a long story to this, but I will do my best to summarize.", "Last night, while I was tripping, 2 of my 3 companions for the evening decided they'd get in on the excitement a bit with some handy Robitussin. The third was a) not interested, and b) the requisite sitter/driver.

After this, he started acting strangely, and in a very disturbing manner.", "It took awhile for my effects to wear off to the level at which I could be certain that it was he and not I who was behaving strangely, but this morning's happenings have ultimately confirmed that. It was ten hours ago (from now, 8:30 AM) that he capped off his cough syrup, and since he tried to project, he's been speaking in a very monotone, broken speech. Very precise and inarticulate. He sounds like a robot, and very noticeably. He cannot think straight or focus on objects that are far away, says he 'doesn't know' when asked how he is, and cannot specify where his limbs are unless he looks directly at them.", "This matches nothing I have experienced, nor anything that anyone I have read of has experienced, with the exception of an individual that mentioned a friend with a 'manic' response to DM and LSD that has required hospitalization for up to a week. My friend, however, has used LSD a handful of times with no undesirable effects during or after the trips. Indeed, he tends to love the stuff. This experience, too, was thrilling, and he found it very amusing until his speech was decaying. Well, to be fair, he found the speech amusing for a couple hours, and recorded himself before getting bored/disturbed with it.", "Also, I was amazed that he wasn't tired. DM _should_, in my understanding, produce a sedating effect. He couldn't fall asleep, though, and didn't know whether or not he wanted to. He eventually did, with the help of the Valerian root that is kept around to cushion the 'ride back down'. The only problem is that he awoke in seemingly the same state. Through the entire drive to get me home, he seemed very disturbed, crossing his eyebrows and looking around alot, sitting in a contorted position. The other person in the car, [Driver's name here], asked if I was used to it lasting this long. I wasn't, and I reminded them that even if I was, I wasn't used to any of the other properties of his experience. The only thing any of us could think of was getting me home without causing alarm, and probing for information, specifically on the 'net.", "I'm somewhat frightened, honestly, and I do not find an uninformed, frightened state to be acceptable for the situation, in which SOME action seems necessary, and perhaps with relative haste.", "With all the negative stuff floating around about DXM, I had to respond. Last night I tripped DXM. I'm typing up a complete record of all i remember, which i guess i'll post if there's any interest, but for now i'll just give the basic impressions. OK, first off this was my first drug-induced psychedelic experience, except for n2o at the dentist's once. I've never even smoked pot. I weigh about 175 pounds and I took about 750 mgs of dxm i think (2 4oz bottles of syrup, 3mg/ml dxm-hbr as the only active ingredient.) The only really ill effect i felt was a bit of nausea after quaffing these bottles in about a minute. - i would reccomend not trying to down half a bottle of the stuff in one gulp. this passed within 20 minutes or so. probably about 45 minutes after the initial consumption, i was feeling the effects. I was feeling very bouncy as i walked around, and this one hallway seemed infineitely long. During this stage i felt the need to be very active, and i did stuff like run around and roll down a hill just for the weird feeling of motion (I spent almost the whole time outside). about 2 hours into the expereince i tried to interact with some people, and this made me really realize how stoned i was, because it was very hard to talk and I knew that everything I was saying sounded stupid, but I couldn't help it.", "From about hour 3 to hour 6, I peaked. I spent this entire time sitting and laying under a tree, because I couldn't stand up. My whole dxm experience was devoid of any special visuals - no tracers or cool chromatics or anything like that. I did however have several visions (for lack of a better word) during this peak. Some were actually visual, in that i actually saw things but these were all with my eyes closed and pretty grainy, and none were colorful. These included some kaleidiscopic mandalas, and a weird spiraling form made up of faces, actually there were 3 spirals all circling around each other, and each was made of a stream of faces. the other 'visions' all related to my feelings about myself. these included melting into the ground, turning into hard rubber and being unable to move, and merging with the tree i was sitting against and then spinning around and around it very quickly, while it was spinning around something else, so i was spinning on several different levels. The most memorable vision was when i became aware of two axes that divided my body diagonally, and i could feel my body/my conciousness spiralling around these axes and expanding outwards along them until it became infinite.", "after the peak, i tried to stand up. I hugged the tree for a minute and fell back down. It took several more attempts at standing up and walking around, over about an hour, before i was able to walk back home. I was still totally wasted for about 2 hours after i made it home. I tried to talk to people during this time, but it didn't work. Someone who knew what i was doing, whom i had discussed it with earlier, tried to talk to me about how it went, and i can vaguely remember trying to relate my experience to Carl Jung's Man and his Symbols and not doing a very good job of it. Anyway, about 9 hours after the initial consumption, I was suddenly aware that I was completely sober and awake. ", "I'm not sure if i'm hung over or not. I woke up with a mild headache and a dry throat, but that could be attributed to only getting 4 &a half hrs of sleep.", "miscellaneous trip notes: during the first part of the peak I had lots of strange insights, about how I had been tripping for all of my life, how the entire universe was constructed by me in my mind, and what was i thinking when i put such&such in there, surely i could have done better. I saw 4 dogs throught the whole trip, and I wondered if they were my totem or something like that. I saw them a long time before i saw their owners (there were 2 dogs each time, with one owner each time, and 2 times i saw dogs). They were all big dogs, and I'm not sure if they were hallucinations or if my sense of time was just totally screwed (their owners didn't look real, but then not much did - especially people and cars) because they seemed to run all around and basically be everywhere at once, or they would be by a tree here one instant and then by a tree way over there the next.", "I didn't have any warping of the senses like some people had reported. The closest I came to this was having my sense of touch messed up, so that the grass under me, and sometimes I, felt like rubber, and there was a separation of touch sensations when i touched myself, so that it was like i was touching someone else and someone else was touching me, and not the merging of sensations when i usually touch myself. also, around the last half of the trip i stoped being able to focus on anything, so I had double vision.", "misc. misc trip notes: -the crickets around me were playing 'heaven' by the Talking Heads for quite a long time -when i was laying down looking up at my tree, the lights of the cars on a nearby road looked like fire.", "well i guess i don't need to post my earlier record, that's most of it right there. some closing notes: DXM can be a very heavy trip. It knocked me on my ass for 3 hours that were full of bizarrly metamorphed conciousness. Would I do it again? not soon, and i'll probably try some of the other stuff out there first. But I would consider it a positive experience. Also, during the peak I became very aware of either a higher-conciousness me or just another higher conciousness telling me that I should do it with a partner next time, so I won't do it alone anymore, not that that was a very bad thing. So if you're curious about the DXM trip, I would say get the dextromethorphan faq (great work, whoever put this together) and try it.", "It all got started when my friend C.Q. took me to Wal-Mart after a Mardi Gras parade (I live in South Louisiana). He was telling me about all the fun he and his friends had had on robitussin while I was a good catholic boy at a good catholic high school. So, he bought two bottles of maximum strength robitussin, one for me and one for him. When we got home he found that he couldn't choke down his bottle, he had done so much that now the smell made him vomit. Jokingly he handed me his bottle, saying 'You drink it.' I had already slammed down mine, so I drank his before he could stop me. He looked at me for a long moment, then said, and I quote 'Oh dear. Well, now you're in for it.'", "We went back to his bedroom, and he told me to lie down and relax. I did. This was about the same time I discovered the Cure, and I asked him to put their 'Pornography' album on. ", "The first hint of a trip was an apparent slowing of the world around me. Then C.Q., in a brilliant move, announced that he was tired and turned off the light, leaving me awaiting a trip I was totally unprepared for in the dark with this hideously evil music playing. Playing ad infinitum, as he had put it on repeat. Eventually I became EXTREMELY paranoid, and the room seemed to become quite hot. I was convinced that the devil himself was there in the room. I did not think 'Oh I'm on drugs' or anything like that. To me, it really and truly appeared that Satan was there with me. The room seemed awash in a hellish glow, which can probably be partially attributed to my pupils dilating to the extreme. ", "I went on like this for the entire night (from about 2am til 7am) and when C.Q. awoke he said I was pale and sweating profusely, and gripping the bedsheets for dear life. I actually remember very little from the actual trip, I only remember the feeling that there was a tremendously evil presence there with me, and that the room was extremely hot. I'm no mystic, I am certain that these effects were due to the combination of the music, the darkness, and, of course, the 700mg of DXM coursing through me, and not some actual demonic presence. However, it was still the most terrifying experience of my life, and one I will never attempt to repeat. ", "I have done DXM since, mostly in smaller (200-400mg) doses, and in more positive settings.

Pressure is still there which seems to have stayed in the same locations just increased in strength.", "Much more intense effect now. Music sounds very good. I am currently listening to Aphex twin - I Care Because You Do. I find that experimental/ambient are wonderful for dxm trips. Nausea is staying the same amount as before.", "Not much new to report except a slight downward pressure on my entire body beginning to gradually increase. All previous effects still present.", "*self notes. Has been 2 hours and it seems to be much less intense then my previous 500mg dosage, lets see how things go.", "Starting to feel the full dxm effects. Slight loss in motor control (legs not doing wut i tell them). Slight loss in balance ability. Focusing eyes on objects 10-15 feet away difficult.", "Greatly involved in my trip, very dissasociated.

I had never tried any dissasociatives before, so I jumped at my chance and bought a pill.", "I waited a few days to sort of mentally prepare myself, And I dropped the pill at 9:00.  It took about an hour for the effects to kick in. This drug hits my body HARD! I felt light, but at the same time like I was being sucked into my bed. Time was extremely distorted, so I lost track of it.", "My vision started to fuzz, and I eventually started to see double. The effect was pretty uncomfortable; I couldn't really focus on anything so I just closed my eyes. My closed eye visuals consisted mostly of unfamiliar rooms and chambers, really uneventful. My body started to tremble and itch in a nagging and uncomfortable way. My motorskills were shot, in fact, to the point where I could NOT get up from the bed. At this point I started to have the sensation of wild body distortions.", "My body felt like it was flowing and reshaping itself. I have had similar body halucinations on LSD where my body would feel the same as my closed eye visuals looked, but with LSD the feeling is of being a two dimensional pattern while this was very three dimensional. This didn't seem to last very long, but the feeling was replaced with an overwhelming sensation of being sucked out of my body. This continued throughout the trip with several different themes including being sucked down into a hole, or just drifting around outside.", "At one point I had the sensation of traveling very quickly up out of my body and I remember thinking 'I'm getting really high now!', when the peak experience of my trip hit. Suddenly I was sure that I had died. It's strange how it worked, it was like my inner dialogue all of the sudden yelled 'Oh my god, your dead. you've died!', but the thought seemed beyond my control, almost as if it came from the drug rather than me. ", "Then as clearly as anything in my life I felt on my skin and even saw through my eyelids what I can only describe as the light at the end of the tunnel. It was such a calming, pleasant, sensation that I reached my arms out to embrace it. I felt truly at peace and I was happy to know that I didn't have to worry about any of my problems anymore. For a second it was pure bliss, but then I realised that I was still aware of my body so I must not be dead. This made the whole experience semm cheapened, and I quickly returned to my body. My peak experience seemed to take only a few seconds, but all these things occured to me in that time. The trip went on for a few hours after and kinda petered out.", "Although the feeling of dying seemed artificial, It also made me put a lot of things in my life into a new perspective, and since then I feel that my life has been more satisfying. I have had a hundred psychedelic experiences prior to doing dex, but this trip seemed to finally show me what I was looking for in my inner voyages. I havn't felt a strong need to trip on anything since, and previously I've had a reputation as an acid addict.", "Every summer I am forced to spend six weeks with my father and stepmom in VA. It's a pain in the ass to leave my pals in Juneau, Alaska during the prime drug season, but I have to deal every year. This year was going to be different, I kept telling myself. I'd go to a mall or a teen center and buy some weed off of someone, no problem right? After 3 weeks I had no weed, and the only drug that I had been able to find was dimenhydrinate, (Dramamine), which was a scary experience by myself. But after conversing with my friends via ICQ, I decided to try some DXM, and convinced my stepmom that my cold needed treating and to get some Robitussin Maximum Strength. ", "   I waited until a day when I would be on my own at a mall, and drank the whole bottle. The cough syrup made me gag and it was so sickeningly sweet that I drank two bottles of water along with it. I then put on my coat and took off for the metro station, which was a few blocks over. ", "   The ride over was interesting; I kept feeling the sensation to doze off, though probably not drug inspired, I had stayed up the night before watching 'Kids in the Hall' reruns. After about an hour and a half I still wasn't feeling anything and gave up thinking about what I would do at the mall under influence. Just then a security guard got on the metro car and looked at me funny. I sat back and started to read my book, (the same page over, and over), and kept peering up at him from time to time. 5 minutes later, the very top of my head started to itch, and as I reached up to scratch it, the itching intensified. Over the course of the ride to the mall, My entire head began to itch like crazy, and I couldn't stop scratching it. I was getting afraid that the guard would wonder what the hell was going on. The itch moved down to my forehead and I decided to give the scratching a rest for a bit, maybe it'd go away. When the train stopped, I stood up and felt very dizzy and pretty high, and as I stepped down the staircase at the metro stop, I felt like I was floating down from step to step. I entered the mall and sat down at a bench.", "   I started to feel very sick the more a looked around the food court, and noticed that the itching had grown stronger once again, this time moving down my back. I itched and scratched until my whole back and head ignited as if a bad sunburn. This didn't really freak me out, (even with the paranoia), but I calmly paced the 4 stories of the mall with the burning itching spreading all the way down to my thighs. It never progressed further, but it still bugged the hell out of me. After a while, my left hand started to feel swollen, and it became difficult to close. I could feel my heart pumping blood into every inch of my body, and the burning failed to cease even when I held back from scratching. Soon nausea overtook me, and I started down towards the exit, noticing my right hand swell too. I felt an urgent need to find a bathroom before I left to check my face, which had started to feel tight and rubbery, but failed to find one in the entire mall. I took a drink of water from a fountain, and bought a 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' poster and headed for the metro stop. ", "   On the way back, my face grew so tight that it was hard to open my mouth or speak. I was wondering whether or not the pleasant tingling/high sensation was worth the nausea, when the metro stopped and I called my stepmom for a ride home, (took me a while to get my senses together to actually start fumbling with the phone). I walked outside into the parking lot, and sat down because of the extreme nausea and dizziness that had come over me. It kept getting worse, and worse over the next half an hour, until I remember asking god for help, (I hadn't talked to god without the influence of drugs since I was 6). Yes, the pain was that bad. Worse that the worse hangover I had ever experienced, and then to my relief, I threw-up pink Robitussin all over the pavement and into the bushes. It just kept coming, until I felt my body was purged from the poison. Then I hunched back over, and waited until my stepmom pulled up. Gave her some crazy story about how a drunk homeless guy puked next to me and how I followed his lead. She believed me and drove me home where I slept for 12 hours in the middle of the day, swollen hands and all.", "   So if you think your ready for dextromethorphan, go ahead give it a shot, you have my blessings. Just be careful and carry a barf-bag. The high was nice, the nausea was retchid. That's all that I can say.", "Well, to begin this story, I'd like to give a little bit of my background. I was fairly inexperienced with any form of drugs in high school (with the exception of drinking alcohol and a few joints among some friends of mine), and I pretty much kept in the straight and narrow. After I graduated from high school, however, I felt the need to experiment with some psychedelics. For what reason, I'm not really sure. Curiosity, more than likely.", "I heard about DXM from a friend of mine on the internet. I had wanted to try LSD, instead but someone told me DXM was more fun (at least from his personal experience). I wondered where I could acquire this aforementioned drug, and he told me that I could locate it in the medicine section of my local pharmacy. He also gave me the address of a very good FAQ (http://www.frognet.com/dxm) [Erowid Note: FAQ now available here] so I could research it -- as well as keep from killing myself by downing a bottle or two of Nyquil.", "I was a little apprehensive at first. I noticed all the warnings about 'brain damage' and 'kidney failure', which although rare, still frightened me. However, after reading through the entire FAQ, I found that you could do this drug safely, without falling prey to the DXM boogie man. So I resolved to try it.", "I went to the local Big Bear and bought a 4oz bottle of Robotussin Maximum Strength. I didn't want to go too high on my first trip, so I only drank 2 ounces (which was 177mg... consistent with a low second plateau dose). I was so anxious that I was practically bouncing around the room in a childlike giddiness. However, after about 30 minutes, I was noticing no real effects. I was very disappointed. So I decided to go out for a drive. While I was driving, I noticed a slight nausea, and discovered it was very pleasurable to yawn. However, driving was making me sick so I resolved to find some place to stop. It was a clear night, so I decided to drive out to a local lake and lie out under the stars.", "Once I had arrived at the lake, I began playing some music from my tape deck. I was amazed! It sounded glorious! Every note seemed to reverberate through me, and it seemed to have a hidden dimension that was now revealed to me. I must have sat there listening to music for a good 3 hours. I had a profoundly decent experience, as well as a drunken-stoned-like buzz in general. The next morning, I was in an excellent mood, probably better than I ever had been. Life seemed to have a new profound meaning to it.", "I eventually discussed this experience with a few of my friends, and finally persuaded them to try it with me. We took a couple of trips (I didn't increase my dosage very greatly), spacing each trip by at least a week. We all had a blast. I would almost go as far as to say that it forged a new bond between a few of my friends and myself. They thanked me for telling them about this drug, since they had only gone as far as alcohol and marijuana.", "Well, to get to my profound and inspiring trip, I'll skip ahead to the 5th time I tried it. I had purchased a container of Robotussin Honey Cough (the other flavors seemed to make me very nauseous now, but I could stand the taste of Honey Cough). I asked if my friends were up to tripping with me, but they declined, and said they had plans to drink that night. I told them it was ok, but that I wanted to trip anyways. ", "With some reluctance, I managed to chug that 4oz bottle of Honey Cough (10mg per 5ml, making 4 ounces roughly 236mg of DXM). I decided that it wouldn't be as much fun to just do a second plateau trip if no one else was doing it, so I said that I was going to go pick up some more HC. I drove to the store and returned with two more bottles. This took about 10 minutes, at which time I noticed I was beginning to get a little nauseous. I made the mistake of *running* from my car back to the house -- and realizing I left the bottles in my car, I *ran* back to the car, grabbed them, and *ran* back to the house again. All this exertion made me horribly nauseous, and I almost puked. If not for a swig of Pepto Bismol and some intense will power, I probably would have spilled my guts. But I managed to hold it in.", "I came back in, and noticed I had reached the first plateau. My friends, who were drinking inside, saw the bottles and asked 'You're not going to drink all that, are you?'. I told them I had no intention of drinking both bottles, just one more, and the other would be for anyone else who was up for some.", "After about 15 to 20 minutes of light conversation, I hit the second plateau, and said that I might want to take another bottle. My friends said I should probably wait, since I was still kind of nauseous (and they didn't want my lunch revisited on their nice carpet). After maybe another 5 minutes, everyone who was drinking starting talking about going to a party a few blocks away. I told them I couldn't go, because moving around would make me sick to my stomach. They agreed and decided to go without me.", "After they all left, I went into the bathroom and poured the next bottle of Honey Cough into a drinking mug, and chugged the entire thing (increasing my dosage to 472mg of DXM, which is about 7.8mg/kg). I came back out, and was nauseous again, but not as badly this time. The general sick feeling went away after about 2 minutes this time.", "I felt totally wasted. But in a good way. Two of my friends (one who lives there, and his girlfriend) came back in to keep an eye on me. Actually, I think they came back to make out, but they *told* me they would keep an eye on me. It seemed like they were gone for about 10 minutes, but they told me they had just went into the hallway for about 3 minutes. They conversed with me for a good while during the trip, although I don't recall much of the actual conversation. I gave my friend the other bottle, and told him to use his discretion (intoxicated as it may be) of whether to allow me to consume it. I think I began to enter the transition stage a few minutes later. ", "[After this point, I am unable to timestamp any of the events, due to DXM's memory encoding nature]", "We had a strobe light going, and any time it would flash, there would be these 'big black dots' right in front of my eyes. I laughed about it and perceived them as my pupils. It was unusual however, because they would not always move with my line of sight. They were more or less stationary, unless I *really* re-adjusted my vision. They eventually went away, after I stopped looking at the light. I think this was simply my loss of stereoscopic vision. ", "At some point, I decided that I wanted to consume the rest of the remaining bottle. My friend advised me against it, and told me if I was determined, to at least just take half. So I took his advice, and drank another 2 ounces of the syrup (putting my dosage to 590mg, which is about 9.7mg/kg). However, a few minutes later, and behind my friend's back, I drank the rest of the syrup (putting me at 11.7mg/kg). This was when I really started tripping.", "I was utterly fascinated with the actions of my friends, as well as my own hands. They seemed so foreign to me, and looked so unusual and useless (as far as tools go). I don't remember much of what I said, and I'm told most of it was gibberish. I was still sitting up, so I decided to lie down.", "Hallucinations were vague and transparent in manner. If I re-adjusted my vision, it would 'phase in' and trigger a mild hallucination, usually if there was little or no light in the direction I was looking. I would see into walls, and see things hanging on them that weren't actually there. Most of the time, they were highly detailed, and I felt that if only my eyes would focus, I could get some meaning out of them. It never really happened. I felt somewhat angry at my eyes because they couldn't focus on anything. To give you an idea of the kind of hallucinations that ocurred, you can do this little trick. Take a camera with a flash bulb into a totally dark room. Now, looking straight ahead, take a picture with the flash on. The flash will reveal all the furniture and stuff in the room, which will be very bright at first, but will then fade into very detailed pictures of the objects. This is the picture burned into your retinas. However, in my hallucinations, the images would be totally arbitrary pieces of furniture and other objects, as well as imagined images, which had no way of getting into my retinas. This was somewhat concerning, but I realized I was tripping, so I had fun and went along with it.", "If I had both eyes open, I found it very difficult to hallucinate from all the sensory input, since my stereoscopic vision was totally gone (e.g. seeing double). I would occasionally close one eye, which would boost me into a totally vivid yet non-spatial hallucination which would be dissolved slowly when I opened my other eye. I could merge with reality, but only if I moved from my current location. The more I stayed in one place, the more I hallucinated and transformed the environment.", "At some point, I noticed that I now had the ability to concentrate thought enough to change my surroundings, totally fooling my senses into thinking I was somewhere I was not. I began staring at the wall across from me. I noticed how the paneling (although I didn't know it was paneling at the time) was in the shape of a window, so I thought it must actually be a window instead of a wall. Just then, the white wall slowly faded into a blackish-blue night sky color, and I could see billions of stars out beyond the now-transformed wall. I resolved that if the only thing I could see from this window were the stars, that I must be somewhere very high up in the night sky. Then I felt as if I was seated at the top of a very tall clear-window elevator. The perception of it seemed absolutely realistic, and the entire room seemed to be equally transformed to this delusion. At some point, my friend (who was lying on a bed directly in front of the wall) had shifted position, causing the illusion to be distorted in a manner I couldn't exactly call visual. It caused me to decide to snap out of the hallucination, and to tell him what I had seen. However, I only managed to blurt out 'Whoa, I just had a major hallucination.'", "Across the room from me was a digital clock. I don't really think I noticed the clock at first, but eventually I began hallucinating in a most fascinating manner. I had my eyes closed (or at least, I perceived it as having my eyes closed) and I was having mild hallucinations which were", "very dark (not evil, just not well illuminated). Eventually, I would notice these detailed red entities, which could best be described as 'electronic dogs'. They were red neon outlines of pixellated dogs, which would roll around and just generally 'frolic' with each other. After awhile, I tried to focus my non-responsive eyes in on them, in order to determine what kind of creatures they were. To my surprise, they suddenly melted into one another, and turned into the current time. The time then floated back to where it's normal position was, and the entire room faded back into focus. I would shut my eyes again, only to have the same process repeated. I imagine this was my loss of stereoscopic vision for the most part; but some of the motions that these images acted out would indicate my eyes were doing complete rotations in my eye sockets. ", "Occasionally, when one of my friends would say something, I would be totally unaware that they had even spoken at all, if it hadn't have been for their mouth moving. Generally this applied only to one word responses -- if they were to spit out an entire sentence I would understand what they said for the most part.", "At some point, I needed to take a piss, so I went into the bathroom. Avoiding the evil mirror, I made my way (very slowly) over to the toilet, and started going. I looked over to the shower, which was dark. After a couple of seconds it phased out and looked like someone was in it, and that the shower was actually a medium sized room. The illusion of a person standing behind the curtain seemed so realistic, I recall trying to speak to it, thinking it was one of my drunken friends playing a trick on me. I thought this only because I saw the curtain move. However, after I was done, I swatted at the curtain and saw that there was nothing there. So I went back into the room.", "I recall thinking about both sex and murder. Both seemed very very curious for me, and the punishment for committing murder seemed totally frightening when compared to the crime. Time seemed ten-fold more important than life, and serving such a long period of time without freedom seemed utterly terrifying, when compared to the absolute freedom granted by death. This thought scared me intensely, because I thought it had turned me psychotic or something. Don't get me wrong -- It's not like I wanted to grab a knife and butcher my friends. Murder was still totally revolting, but for different reasons -- now it just didn't make any sense. I thought a good deal about suicide as well. Again, I didn't want to commit it, but I truly looked at it and thought about it. It felt as if it were a way to escape the hidden trivialities of life; the aspects that our brains conceal from us with every waking moment. This thought was very frightening (at least in retrospect) and I decided to stop thinking about such things. I recall some talk of sex, and it seemed totally arbitrary to me. I just 'didn't get it' for some reason. I also recall that I had virtually no sex drive at the time.", "When, sometime during the night, I moved to the living room, I noticed that while staring at the carpet, it would take on different properties. At first it was just a basic rug. But after staring at it for a few seconds, it would seem to be covered with a 'purplish' electricity field, and would then convert to a different texture. At first, it turned into some broken and jagged bricks, and after about 15 seconds, it went back to normal. Then it became encapsulated in the electricity field and became the carpet from my room at home. This illusion lasted for what seemed like about 10 minutes. When I asked my friend if his carpet ", "had any textures on it, he said that it didn't. That eventually broke the hallucination and I decided to travel back to the previous room.", "In the room, we had a small tape deck which was playing Metallica. I find great comfort in music while DXM tripping, because it tends to tie me to reality, as well as being more interesting than usual. However, music became less of a sensory input and more of a 'decoration' while I was at this stage. It's hard to explain. At some point, I recall stating that the music was like 'a poster on the wall'. It was totally one-dimensional and flat. It seemed as if it couldn't get very far from the speaker that was emitting it, without falling to the ground. This was very fascinating, and I found great delight upon realizing this.", "I decided to go to sleep. It felt like it had been about 2 days since I first started. When I closed my eyes, I was still hallucinating. This didn't bother me, however -- I was having a blast. Suddenly, right in the middle of some other hallucination, I noticed I was able to separate myself from my body, and was truly able to view myself from the third person. This was extremely disturbing, since I have never looked in on myself from the outside before. Whenever I touched my face, my legs, or my arms, they felt alien and unusual. My skin felt as if it was not my own. I noticed that pain was totally gone in the form I had known, and was more of a signal from my body than a hurtful force. My friend advised me not to test this by hurting myself, and I took his advice.", "I forget when, but I eventually fell asleep. When I woke up about 8 hours later, I was still tripping. I couldn't see very straight, and I still felt heavily intoxicated. It was now 12 noon on Sunday, and I had begun tripping on 9 PM Saturday! My pupils were practically the size of my entire eyeball, my skin was a flushed pale white, and I was totally spent. I had a hard time moving around without looking like a character from 'The Night of the Living Dead'. However, I resolved that I had to get home to rest up. Against better judgement, I bid farewell to my friends, and went to my car. ", "The drive home was frightening. Never drive under the influence of DXM (or under the influence of anything, for that matter). The landscape seemed to come up to greet me, and I felt like I was going about 2 miles per hour, despite that the speedometer said I was going 55. Finally, I got home, and crawled into bed. I watched a few movies (that I still can't remember), and slept for another 5 hours or so. When I got up, I was still slightly buzzed, and decided to sleep the rest of the night. When I got up the next day, I was totally re-energized, and felt as if I was on top of the world. ", "To tell you the truth, I had one of the greatest times of my life on this trip. But I wouldn't recommend it for a first trip. It would be easy to think you're dying if you're not prepared. I felt very enlightened from this experience, and had a fine afterglow for the next couple of days.", "All in all, I would say that I love DXM, but not to the point of addiction. It's a great psychedelic, and I'm glad that I tried it, and feel wiser after having tried it.", "Well, I tried DXM/Robo (curious story: When I first saw the word 'Robo', I thought it was some lame-o 'net' term. Now I realize its association to a commercial product, and it makes a lot of sense). Here are my [brief] impressions.", "Dose: 250mg (I weigh about 150lbs) Type: generic store-brand cough syrup DM (The only active ingredient being Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide. I think people should better clarify that it is found in the form DXM-Hbr, as I nearly assumed the Hbr was one of the unwanted extras...). Total cost of dose (in Cnd. $) was about $3.50.", "Firstly, ingestion was rather gross. My brain associates anything with that sort of 'texture' with being sick. In fact, for the first 2 hours or so, I had the feeling of 'puke tickles' (the feeling that it was entirely possible to get sick). I was confident I wouldn't, and I didn't get sick, but the feeling was definitely there. [I'm looking for the 'DXM-Hbr extraction' method (email it to me if you have it!), but haven't found it yet].", "After a couple of hours, I had the feeling of a pretty serious alcohol buzz. I've never used LSD, so I can't compare them. No tracers, or anything of that sort. Although I felt giddy and abnormal, my physical co-ordination was barely affected (much unlike alcohol). I wouldn't drive, or anything like that, but it was much easier not to knock things over, etc. In addition, after about 2 hours I had the overwhelming feeling that I'd like to go to sleep (and I very nearly did). For anyone who tries this: Just try to do something to get past the 'sleepy' part...once it passes, your energy comes back full strength (plus some).", "Music seemed to be the same, but I did notice a complete change in my concentration level. I had the stereo cranked, and decided I'd like to watch some Letterman, so I just turned the TV up. I watched TV for a while with the stereo blaring, but still maintained perfect concentration (without concentrating) on everything Letterman said. Seems almost as if it helps the brain to seperate audio tracks better.", "My girlfriend, not knowing my state [I'm usually pretty bizarre, so people don't really notice me in altered states], tried to get me to have sex with her. Not only was I not really interested (I'm usually pretty active), but she really had to work to `get it up'. The feeling was entirely unenjoyable to me (just a sort of numb rubbing), and I knew I couldn't 'cum' in this state. She enjoyed the long time it could remain up (pretty much eternity, really), but I wasn't really into it. Is this everyones impression of this? By the next morning I was happily mounting her, so the effect is quite temporary. I thought I should mention this effect for those who plan upon having sex under this stuff.", "Many television shows seemed so brain-dead that I couldn't believe it. Of course, I usually feel this way, but the feeling was greatly heightened (except, of course, the Simpsons, which seemed even funnier (in an intelligent sort of way) than ever). The biggest thing I noticed about TV was fake/exaggerated human emotions.", "Feelings lasted for about 6-7 HOURS in all. I am amazed at this as the dose I took was only about 8x the recommended dose.", "Probably the bizarrest thing of all was waking up the next morning (after only 6 hours of sleep). It was WHAM, 100% awake. Usually I am still tired when waking up, and it takes a while to get going, but it was 100% instant awakeness. The same thing happened again today. I am curious if this is just coincidence, or has anyone else noticed this?", "BTW, if you wonder why I posted anonymously even though the drug is entirely legal, it has to do with the association of DXM-Hbr with 'cough syrup'. People have a bad impression of this as they associate the utilization of cough syrup as that done by 'bums'. They have this impression as some 'bums' have used cough syrup for the alcohol contained within. Therefore it is considered 'cheap alcohol'. What I got had zero alcohol in it, and I utilized purely for DXM-Hbr. I would be much happier about it if I could extract just the DXM-Hbr and remove the 'cough syrup' association. ", "(BTW: Sometimes I wonder why is this drug used for 'dry hacking coughs' and what the physiological effect it has that leads it to be used for this.)", "I've heard about DXM in a german drug-board. So what, I tried it the same day and... Now, one year later I've become what we would call a real DXM-Freak. So far I've already taken something around 30gr. -mostly through german Hustenstiller. Today I wanna write down the feelings and  thoughts I get during my Trip. So it comes that im sitting here in the middle of Europe, together with 1200mg DXM and the good will to write as english as possible, so that every smart freak out there in the crazy world of Fnord can understand what my DXM-tuned brain will cry out for him:", "2130: I take my first dose - 420mgDXM.

", "2200: I take another 300mg (tt:720mg) no special feelings so far", "I am ''napstering'' the song -HellAwaits- oh damn it makes me smiling...", "2215: I start feeling first pleasant waves gliding through my head. Yeah, this will be a long deep night.The realization of absurd drug-dimensions is knocking on the door of my brainspirit. May I let her in?...", "2230: Music and television sounds diffrent -with a little deepness like I would like to find it on the end of Alices garden. So what, I can feel how I m starting getting dissociated. I take another 180mg (tt:900mg). For some raeson I start doupting if it was a good decision to give me a heavenlike trip. But who cares TakeIT MakeIT. Its time to walk trough. I can feel the jump up to the 2nd plateau.", "2240: Wow, thats total eclipse - I ve got a full dissociative headfeeling. I decide to take the 300mgDXM (totalamount:1200mgDXM:)  My skin gets warm and red. I'm feeling a little bit sick. Reading gets even harder. I'm feeling like one who is totally drunken but has already puked. So not really bad just high.", "2250: Kick ass -this really turns me on. I jumping and flying around the ThirdPlateau so far. My emotians are unbelivable. Yeah happiness and dizziness are makeing a journey inside by body. I feel like being inside a big sponge.

", "Hells kitchen I coudnt even imagine such an absurd kind of being. I mean its fantastic. Now 7am in the morning but  I m still totallly high nowayout wow I cannot keep a cleardirection. what i ve experienced this night is too strange too deep to tell it anybody without gettimg mad. I succeeded. Now I m sitting here in front of my pc -one eye closed to focus the letters on the keyboard. Damn its WOW.", "I thought a lot about human evolution birth and anthropology. About 30minutes  I sit in my chair asking me what I AM. I am a human person, born and brought up. I feel for some way like an animal or like YES thats IT THE MATRIX thats exactly what I m thinking about remembering the last 7 hours. History is just short one step I felt it. The Room in which I tripped was getting much larger. One step seems to be about 10m for me. Everything is circeling around me. Its amazing how dxm can be within higher doses. It really throughs me out of reality i coudnt say if it s dream or reality. In the normal reality we ve time and room/space but with DXM my your blood those two units get miXed up. Yeah man thats it.", "So however, now its monday afternoon and I m still dizzy but man enough to post my trip-report and to think todays night. Ok so finally let me point out that DXM isn t a drug that makes me happy, but if were searching for a reality-break-through experience...", "Wednesday night I took a trip on the DXM express. I took 25 caps of Drixol 'Cough' at 7:00 pm. It took a little over an hour to hit.... in 2 hours I was flying. I did so many things I cannot describe.", "I went into this room. I was 'told' that it was his 'room'. I walked around a corner in the entrance... And He was standing there. I was scared to death. He appeared 50ish. with short dark hair (parted on his left.) He was not handsome in any way. But He looked distinguished and very confident, and gracious. He knew that I was scared to death. He then held out his hand and shook my hand. He said 'Hi ... have a seat'. We sat down and had some small talk. And then I was lead away. He looked slighly Jewish. More like a cross between my Father and a older Me. One thing I was made aware of.... He had nothing to warn me about... nothing to scold me about... and He was glad to se me. He seemed proud of me... and He seemed very suportive. ", "I saw myself... I understood my personality.... It scared the shit out of myself. Every layer of my mind was pealed off... until my first (child) thoughts were left. I saw that my current personality is basically just the way I hide my insecurities.", "Now when I'm flying through D space I feel pretty safe... In fact I'm pretty cocky. Partially because of my mind training... and partially because of by previous beliefs about spirits. I may be temporarily scared.... but I know I'll be OK. Well I ran into this bald black guy. He was living on this real cool platform that contained his living quarters. There was no roof... and no completly enclosed rooms. But he appeared not only wealthy but powerful and wise. He saw how cocky I was.... He challenged me: He said 'I know you are more powerful than me... But let me show you what I know about you.' Then He said, 'Look into my eyes and I'll show you how weak you are.' I looked into his eyes.... and I saw myself again. This time I saw what a small, predictable, lazy, insignificant being I was. Then I backed away from him. I didn't want to see any more. I was humiliated. Then I knew.... even though I could kick his ass... that He could hurt me in other ways. I understood that I need to be a little more respectfull toward those that I meet in D space.", "Several times my thoughts and beliefs were challanged. I was amazed how scary this could be. It seemed that I felt slightly detached from what was going on... I felt kinda safe. Then... the trip seemed to start breaking rules... instead of me watching or observing... the trip sucked me into several realitys that put be in threatening situations... and they became more real... like I couldn't tell what was real and what was a 'vision'. At one point I would live a complete life or 'life thread' in the course of listening to one song. I could barely understand how to use the remote for the stereo.", "All of a sudden I needed to pee. I was tripping like a son-of-a-bitch. I opened my eyes. .. and forced my feet down on the floor. I focused and moved each limb seperatly. I moved like a robot.... very stiff and deliberate. I'm not kidding. I moved like a robot. I finally got my pee done... and made it back to trip land.", "The peak didn't last too long (it seemed.) I think this is because I drank a quart of cranberry juice about 5 hours before I took the D*M.", "There was lots more. I bumped into a planet (or asteriod.) The entire universe reality was destroyed... and another one took its place. I can't even describe all that I saw. Every thing that I believed in was destroyed... What else can I say.", "Wow, DXM is an experience I will never forget. Ive done acid and other drugs before but Ive never been through something soo intense in my life. Me and 2 other friends, Jen and Candice, decided we wanted to go to the movies and Trip, well LSD was not available that day for us to obtain, so we decided we were gonna do a 'robo trip' instead.  We walked down to a local drug store and bought 3 bottles of Robotussin Max. Strength cough syrup (1 bottle per person) making sure the active ingredient was DXM. I had done a robo trip once before but I was only able to consume half a bottle (if even that)and then quit drinking it due to the horrible taste, and nothing happened that 'trip'. Candice had done robo trips before so she was the most experienced between the 3 of us and Jen had never tripped on anything.", "We get to the movies early so that we are the first ones in the theater and we can drink our cough syrup alone. Getting this stuff down was not easy at all! ugh it was horrible but we all managed to get a whole bottle down our throats. From what ive read from other experiences, it takes about an hour to hit you... Well not ours, we drank the bottle at about 2:30 pm and it hit us about 10 minutes later. It came on as Feeling really drunk and our bodies started getting numb. Me and Candice thought it was the coolest thing in the world but Jen was just feeling really sick. When we got up and walked around it felt like we were heavily intoxicated and when we went back to our seats in the theater I started seeing little visuals, like trails and color distortion but thats about it, and when I had to step down a step it looked like it was a 5 foot leap. Of course I laugh at everything so when I step off this step I fall flat on my face laughing. and during this point Im thinking this is the Coolest thing in the world. I was wrong.", "Jen started feeling really sick and asked us to walk her to the bathroom. We get to the bathroom and she tries to throw up the cough syrup to get it out of her system. Nothing comes up so we leave and as we walk back in the door of the Movie she collapses agint the wall and starts vomiting. After shes done getting rid of the cough syrup from her stomach onto the wall we leave the movie and sit in the hallway of the Theater on a bench. Jen said she felt alot better after that and Candice was having a blast with her numb body, and as for me I start to feel really tired and sick.", "What I list next is all I remember and what my friends told me.  I remeber sitting on the bench inside the theater and passing out, waking up in the corner of the theater in my friends lap and them laughing at me and asking if I'm feeling anything. I remeber blacking out several time and what seemed Like 50 years was only about 1 minute. My body went completly numb and I could hear myself asking questions like 'what time is it?' and 'am I dead yet?' but i couldnt feel my mouth moving and right after I would ask that I would blank out so I never remember asking it and I would ask those questions repeatly every 2 minutes. eventually I woke up and puked in the movie theater and passed out again and my friend said they started getting really scared when I kept asking 'am U dead yet?', 'am I gonna die?', 'Please, dont let me die' and 'you cant die on this stuff right, cause Im really scared' and people who worked at the theater started getting suspicious so we had to leave (but i dont remember them or my friends saying we had to leave)but I remember passing out again and candice and Jen trying to pick me up and carry my lifeless body outside the theater.", "Candice later told me after the trip when she tried to pick me she couldnt feel my muscles at all and it felt exactly like pulling on a dead body. So when we got outside I guess they put me on a bench outside and I passed out and when I awoke Jen nor candice were near me, and I was screaming their name and eventually they ran over to me and I told them to stay with me the rest of the time until we left. Candice got really scared cause I was saying scarey shit and talking about death, that she called her parents and told them what we had done and to come pick us up.", "Heres where shit gets really bad and I will NEVER forget this! I remember lying on the bench and couldnt feel ANYTHING, I was just lying there with my eyes open, I couldnt feel myself breathing, Blinking, talking, etc... and I kept saying am I dead yet? but I couldnt feel my mouth moving. I felt like my soul was trapped inside my dead body and I was looking out and i saw the paramedics come, my parents come, and a crowd of people around me and I heard the paramedic's say 'She isnt going to make it' and them rush me to the hospital and I saw myself in the stretcher, hooked up to all these tubes and then the doctor say 'we're sorry but your daughter is dead' and then I saw my Funneral. It was soo Real and sooo scarey but of course all of this was a VERY intense dream and I didnt want to die of stupidity from a drug over dose, and especially from drinking something as stupid as cough syrup.", "So I saw my family and friends all around my grave and me in a coffin. then I come back to being a soul in a dead body at the movies, looking out at the world as I lie here dead. Then the most unbeleiveable thing that has ever happened to me happened and who ever reads this is gonna think Im on crack but I swear a light shown down on me and I swear it was god (and I never believed in god until that happened) and my lifeless body came back to life and came back to reality. by that time candices dad finally got there after I have already died, been to the hospital, and had a funneral, but he managed to get there and I fell asleep in the car and woke up in their driveway puking and her parents screaming at us and by now Im just really drunk, and have come way down off my trip and 7:30 is when I was able to talk somewhat normal but all in all it ended at about 9:00pm.", "In conclusion, It was scarey as hell and I didnt really go into too much detail about how bad the black outs were but there are no words that can describe how bad it was and hopefully no one will ever experience a trip like I had. I honestly thought I was either going to Die or I was gonna be permanetly skrewed up the rest of my life, and my friends thought the same thing. The next morning I felt EXCELLENT, Jen felt hungover, and candice felt like complete ass. I personally will never do this ever again, but I dont regret it and I think it was an experience well learned and it was wayy to intense for comfort.  Certainly doing in a public place like a movie theater was a BIG mistake.", "this was the first time i tried dxm and it was pure white powder, since a friend of mine swallowed it and said it took about 2 hours to kick, i decided to rail it. it had a VERY bitter and gross taste to it, and it was very crytaly. the cap made about 8 little lines and i put em all up my nose within a minute.  10-15 minutes later i could feel the effects, my legs started to get real heavy and i just walked around cause no one else was on it. i dont remember much just that i was FUCKED but snorting it literally burned the piss outta my nose and i had a kleenex to it all night and it was clogged. i started to feel really sick and i puked about 4 times, i puked up slimny white stuff which looked like the powder. i layed down and closed my eyes cause i was too fucked to walk around and my nose was dripping. all in all, would have enjoyed it way more if i hadn't gotten sick so i recommend parachuting NOT snorting it. It was 100% pure and it just doesn't belong up your nose. Mild hallucinations resulted.", "I am a male in my mid twenties. I live alone, hold a steady job and believe I have my head screwed on pretty straight. As I write this, It is about 4:30 AM on a holiday weekend. Last night curiosity led me to experiment with DXM. The experiment began at about 6:00 PM. It is now 4:30 in the morning and the last effects are gradually wearing off.", "The day before yesterday, I had purchased 2 packets of DMX-bearing cough medication, intending to ingest the entire 600 mg dose the next day after returning home from a holiday dinner with the family. I had done substantial research on the substance beforehand, and was careful to make sure that DXM was the only active ingrediant. I weigh 140 lb, and wished to surpass a merely stoning dose and continue on to my first trip.", "From the experiences of others, I believed I knew pretty well what to expect. Still I realized it was not something to be undertaken lightly. My only previous experiences had been with alcohol and marijuana, and I had never gotten more than lightly buzzed off of the latter. I spent a day and a half mentally psyching myself up for the experience. When the time came, I prepared a journal in which to note some of my experiences as they occurred.", "Some of the later entries in my journal will seem quite inane. Please remember that they were written under profound mood alteration and cognitive impairment. I disavow them as reflections upon my sober character. Later, explanatory notes are in brackets.", "'12/25/94, 5:30 PM I prepare.  20 cough caps into a bowl (= 600mg DXM).  Christ -- must I swallow all of these?! A big mugful of water sits nearby.  Had a very large meal 2 hrs. ago -- waiting to digest it well before I start.  Topical antihistamine spray sits nearby in case of itching.' [Note: I never used it.]", "'Setting: Apartment is lit subtly by overhead lights on dimmer switch.  Music is playing -- radio now.  Selected tapes + CDs are laid out for later on.' [Note: I never got to them.] 'I have chosen strongly thematic themes as suggested, while avoiding anything that might be a 'downer'.  There is also some lighter, mood-lifting stuff like pop + techno.'", "'I cleaned the apartment today to make things seem more cheerful.' [Note: I don't think it made a difference.  A book of ancient chinese philisophical verse...] 'sits before me to read while waiting for the onset -- only because I find it comforting and familiar.'", "'Set: I began 'psyching' myself up yesterday.  I feel confident and fairly at ease.  Also curious.  Curiosity, I think, is my main reason for doing this.  Perhaps I'll even learn something about myself? I don't know.' [Note: I still don't.]", "The journal goes on to note the circumstances of the ingestion of the caps. I note that I found it both physically and psychologically easier to down them than I expected, though there was a transient problem with gas (which I eventually dealt with by taking the caps with milk). To keep my mood up I sang with the radio and read. It took from 5:55 to 6:46 to down them all (with a few long pauses to burp up gas and let my stomach settle).", "At 6:33 (while taking caps #9 and 10) I note feeling 'different. Hard to describe.' The first spelling errors appear at this point. I was aware of them at the time, but left them uncorrected.", "At 6:38 I note reminding myself that no matter what happens, it's only temporary, and that if I just relax I'll be O.K..", "'Cap #15, 16 w/ milk.  I think it's about to hit me! There's this sense of 'impending'.  Especially when I get up to walk around.  Head feels heavy somehow.  [....] Feet light as I get up to check the time.  It's [now] 6:51.  Cap #17,18, w/ milk.  What the hell.  #19+20 while I'm at it.  600 mg in system.  No turning back now!'", "Indeed. I must admit I felt at least a mild sense of forboding in that.", "At 6:55 I note feeling no noticable difference in the quality of music. Disappointing, as music-related euphoria was an effect I had heard often associated with DXM and had hoped to experience. I decided to go outside and catch some air, leaving the journal behind.", "I walked some blocks to a familiar pond in a nearby city park. The odd feeling in my feet and head had passed (or was at least being ignored), but as I walked I observed a new phenomenon. Buildings seem to stand more starkly outlined against the night sky. Yet they seem somehow absurd in proportion, like children's toys blown up to gratuitous scale. Stars were clear and bright.", "Reaching the pond, I gazed out across the water at the surrounding city scape. I noticed the first 'tracing' effects. As I swept my gaze from left to right or vice versa, the lights would pan not continuously, but in blocks -- about four blocks per 120 degree sweep. A mildly unpleasant phenomenon, and one which was to last the length of the trip. It was as if my brain were no longer able to keep up with the sudden changes in scene causes by rapidly moving my eyes or head.", "I stayed at the pond only minutes. On the way back, I was feeling fairly good. I had obviously reached the first DMX 'plateau' and was substantially stoned. I wasn't really euphoric, just upbeat and at peace. Everything seemed exceptionally clear and still, as though viewed through a layer of deep, limpid water. Contrasts seemed much starker. I briefly lost track of where I was a time or two but quickly reoriented myself and proceeded home.", "Arriving at my apartment, I made the following journal entry in rather scrawling letters:", "'I have returned.  I visited the pond several blocks away. Dark, with city lights shining about.' [No duh.  Noone ever accused DXM of improving mental accuity.] 'Noticed tracing effects.'", "Immediately following two or three thoughts were started and aborted in succession:", "'profoundly everything seemed dar' [This line is crossed out.]", "Just as soon, the second plateau hit me. Thank god it had waited until I got home. I turned the radio and lights off, turned the TV up (for 'company', I think) and dropped into bed, feeling totally stupified. The chatter on the tube was entirely irrelevent. Occasionally a snippet would float through to me, and I could make sense of larger stretches if I concentrated. For the most part, however, the chatter was ignored. Through closed eyes, I could see the light from the TV reflecting off the wall and penetrating my eyelids. I seemed particularly sensitive to it. But whenever the light intensified or dimmed gradually, it did so in steps. Pulling the covers overhead, I began to see visions.", "These took on the character of glowing, multicolored taffy, being pulled and stretched in many directions at once. Most entertaining. I kept my eyes closed throughout -- the real world was not entirely pleasant with all that blocky shifting and tracing. These visions, visible only with eyes closed, flowed smoothly and soothingly. I had expected the cartoon-like visuals many DXMers had described, but these were nothing of the kind. Gradually, these shifting forms were taking on more substance. They were coelescing into life-forms; entities really -- spectacular, bioluminescent, massy things that churned like thick, boiling, liquid. They came in various colors -- white, black, dark blue, and purple, mainly. Some were like churning walls of gel. Some were like complex blobs, jellyfish, or worms with thousands of psuedopods. All were constantly writhing and huge. I could sense they were intelligent.", "I seemed to be an interesting specimen to them. They approached freely. Some of them picked me up and passed me around. But I never felt as if I were in danger. These things seemed not only friendly, but affectionate. I felt affectionate toward them as well. Thier appearances were not monstrous so much as stunningly beautiful. I was in awe, really. 'Glorious' was the word that came to mind at the time.", "One by one, an 'entity' would come over and 'play' with me, like a child with a new toy. They would touch me, sensing my thoughts. There were immensely powerful yet gentle. It was somehow very pleasurable. Each entity had it's own character and personality. I tried talking to them, but they couldn't understand speech. They responded only to empathy and simple thoughts.", "Occasionally I found myself looking at my surroundings (though just as often they were not visible in the blackness). I saw living vault-like walls so huge and distant they staggered the mind. Once something like a quivering city of jello came into view. Sometimes I seemed to floated toward nebulae deep in space.", "At some point I attracted the attention of the Great Queen Mother (literally) of the entities. Words are inadequate. The Queen Mother was a wasp-like thing so immense that her body was like a pocket universe unto itself. I could never see more than a small fraction of her at a time. I journied inside her and communed with her for hours. We were empathically linked somehow. I realize this sounds utterly insane, and it is. We felt overwhelming affection for each other. I made up a song and kept singing it for her. She alone could understand not only my emotions, but my words. I somehow felt it necessary to record the song in my journal. And to answer nature's call! Eventually, I mustered up the willpower to stagger out of bed.", "My god, what a sight things were. Even through my double vision, I could see how incredibly screwed up all proportions were. I felt like a big insect. My body seemed proportioned vaguely like some kind of praying mantis in human skin. And yet it was all so consistent. Proportions were screwed up in a very stable manner. I could look at something, look back, and it would look the same. Distances seemed exagerrated and contrasts were abnormally sharp. Outlines, while similarly sharpened, were made up of more than just one line (probably due to my double vision). This gave the illusion that I could see a little more of the sides of an object than would be normally visible. It was a little like looking through everything through the wrong end of a misaligned pair of binoculars. I thought of it as 'insect vision'. My steps were short and slow. I shuffled to the bathroom automoton-like and took a wizz. Then I emerged to make my journal entry, in childish, blocky letters. The M's in 'mother', 'human', and 'almost' have 3 humps instead of two. I could really barely see what I was writing, and couldn't be sure it would be readable the next day.", "'10:51: I LOVE THE GREAT QUEEN MOTHER.  ACCCPT [= 'accept'] THE LOVE I OFFER.  I OFFER ALL MY HUMAN LOVE.' [Such was my song.] 'THIS IS MOST INTERESTING.' [Referring to my 'insect vision'.] 'ALMOST CUBIST!'", "Things were getting more 'rigid' somehow. My thinking and movement were both very stilted. I staggered back to bed and fell back into communion with the Queen Mother a while longer. The trip was getting very heavy -- time and motion were losing all meaning. My visions were starting to freeze in place, as if everything were crystallizing or being coated in wax. I felt as if the Queen Mother were sealing me inside a waxen cell within her body. Yet I wasn't afraid -- I figured she knew best. It felt very protective in a way.", "Before long though, just like a fever breaking, I felt that peak of the trip passing. Things 'unfroze' or 'decrystallized' and the visions started subsiding substantially. They quickly became intermittant rather than constant, and I was beginning to be able to think again, though in that stilted way. Disconcertingly, my 'insect vision' was still in effect and my motor skills still very 'rigid', as I discovered upon hauling myself up to make the following entry (in the same blocky lettering as before, with a 3-humped 'M' in the first 'many').", "'THE GREAT QUEEN MOTHER HAS MANY CHILDREN.  I AM BUT ONE. I HAVE MANY SIBLINGS.  [So it seemed at the time; I had learned that the entities encountered earlier had been siblings.] IT IS 11:10? THE PEAK IS PAST. DOUBLE VISION.'", "I turned the TV off and the radio on, then went back to bed to catch some sleep, praying that my vision and movement would be back to normal when I awoke. As I waited for sleep, I watched some entertaining hallucinations. One was like sliding down a tunnel of molten bronze. Another was like gliding over a wierd, undersea city. Occasionally something playing on the radio seemed particularly stirring, especially if it had heavy electric guitar riffs, but that's as close as I ever came to DXM music euphoria. Then I slept.", "My next journal entry says, in almost normal looking cursive:", "'2:33: Wake up.  Dread to open eyes proves unfounded when I look at clock and see double vision is gone.'", "I had actually been awake for 15 minutes or more, but had dreaded to open my eyes and see two of that damn LED clock. My heart had been beating rapidly as if in in anxiety. Getting up to make that entry, proportions seemed normal again and I felt much more human (though not entirely back to normal). It was quite a relief. I relaxed and realized I'd be O.K.. I took another wizz, went back to bed, and said my goodbyes to the Queen Mother and her brood (yes, really). They were forming into a sort of fleet and preparing to fly away. It was rather touching in it's way, though of course utterly insane. The Q.M. understood that I had to return to the human world, and bid me farewell. I promised to remember her.", "'2:55: The Queen Mother has departed.  I have promised to write [well] of her.  She was very special.  We have said our goodbyes.  Human perceptions returning.  This experience has been most interesting.  Starkly beautiful.  I will write fondly of it -- and her.'", "Obviously my mood was still altered. Bear in mind that in retrospective sobriety, the experience seems much less warm and fuzzy, (though not less interesting). In fact even at the time I think I was aware that this would be the case. I believe I was attempting to preserve in my journal some of the powerful emotional content of the experience, which my memory could preserve only dimly.", "I slept some more, and awoke at about 4:30 feeling much more myself. It felt good to be a human being again. Only tiredness (from too little sleep) and a slight stone remained, and I began this expose'. It is now several hours later. There was no hangover, nor any incidence of deja vu (which some users have described). On the other hand, the feeling of being 'reborn' which some have described is also not in evidence.", "Reflecting upon the possible influences on my trip, I've come to the conclusion that the fact that I've been reading a book on the social lives of ants may have had some bearing at least on the appearance and character of the Queen and her brood. What did they represent? Fragments of my own psyche? The fevered attempts of a stoned brain to codify sensory data and enhanced emotional states it no longer comprehended? I don't know (though offhand I would consider the latter explanation more likely).", "My sober thoughts about this experience are on the whole positive. There were only a few slightly scary or disconcerting moments. I'm not sorry I did it, but I have no real desire to do it again anytime soon, nor would I urge others to try it. Curiosity was my main motivation, and my curiosity has been satisfied. Moreover, the experience was overpowering in a way -- too much so to be repeated lightly. I can see how had it turned out badly, it could have been very bad indeed. It is not impossible that someday I'd again visit that insane Wonderland (or another) for further exploration (I am considering growing my own magic mushrooms next) but I am content to let it wait until I again feel entirely prepared.", "wow. this is definitely the most pleasurable experience i have ever had. i am off now to go do older-brotherly-duties, but i suggest you at least read it. definitely a VERY good experience. nothing but positive out of it. kinda like to hear whate mr. white has to say about the time distortions. those were _weird_.", "impossible. I am going to attempt, for the benefit of myself and others, to describe the experience i had last night. please note, also, that i am as i write this, living down a pretty glorious acid trip, and trying to jump into another day on the job, via 10mg Ephedrine HCl. anyhow, to get on to the task at hand.", "So last night, i bought 2 600mg packages of DXM. (Drixoral Liquicaps!) my friend chugged his pills and dosed 1 tab (if you figure he had about 2 _good_ tabs around 125ug each, thats ~250ug LSD) about 730pm. (we will referr to him as 'D' now) This was D's first experience on the drug, i think. We each weigh in the neighborhood of 120kg. so the 600mg was a fairly low dose, ~5mg/kg. I was going to be driving someone around at 1030, so i refrained. D then smoked a little marijuana (i think about 4 grams of some pretty good stuff). He was enjoying it (it probably being the acid) at 930, and at 1030, but wasnt really noticing the effects of the DXM. at 1030, i called the friends i was supposed to be driving, and plans didnt work out. so at about 1045 or 1100, we went to the school next door to my house. I took all my pills fairly quickly, and then played with my two tabs. Eventually, D started rolling around on the ground telling me how good it felt. i explained to him that there was avery high chance of that being DXM. he told me he liked it a lot. in the meantime, i would guess it was around 1125 or so, i was beginning to feel a bit sick to my stomache (which is unusual, i usually dont have problems with the pills that way), and i guessed that smoking a little marijuana would stop that. it did, but i took a very small amount of it. i took about two hits off of the plant that D was smoking in the hours before 1100pm. D was really enjoying things by about 1145, and he decided it would be fun to play with the computer and listen to music (specifically Pink Floyd -- it seems that its right for almost all occasions, all drugs). When we got to my house, D didnt agree with Pretty Hate Machine after a while, and it was quickly replaced with Pink Floyd. At this point, he was calling various bulletin boards and talking to people while th effects of DXM washed over me (and thats a good description, too. thats what it felt like. as if the effects were washing in on me with a tide). When i stood up and felt the very typical DXM-ish movement feelings (people who have used this know exactly what im talking about), i decided that it would be fun if i got in on the modem games, too. So i posted a couple of pretty unintelligible messages and bothered a few people, and then D and i got to talking.", "The best way to describe how i felt at that point would be ... ripped out of time. i was having INTENSE feelings of 'waking up' at one moment, when i had very vague memories of another moment, and i was asking questions like i wasnt sure it had actually happened. D indicated after a while he wanted to leave, and i kept saying 'Did you just say you wanted to leave?' over and over. it was very much like i couldnt believe that that moment, which had passed through my senses a second or two ago, actually existed. This lasted for quite a while. i have no real concept of time, and in fact dont remember much in that period except that it was STRANGE. Exhillarating, yes, STRANGE. Vague memories of looking at myself in the bathroom mirror thinking that i would just walk out of there and it would be a sunny afternoon and i would be sober (i think D was making me anxious at this point ant i had a sense of urgency for it to end. unwise, i think.) and just walk around. the sensation seemed so far off, like i could never possibly be sober again if i didnt get the exit from the bathroom just right.", "Leading up to and descending from the peak of the trip.", "well i noticed some weird things that i didnt notice normally on a usual DXM trip. Note that i usually take 900mg+ and this was a much lower dose than normal. First was that i really didnt feel pain at all. i felt pressure. i even went as far as to demonstrate this to D by repeatedly punching my arm. I have a bruise there and thought that i was stupid for doing it later, but i think its important to note that you shouldnt deal with anything that could be painful. period. you could really hurt yourself and not even know it. i also had the fun stuff from DXM and pot, but i didnt think i should be feeling as 'laughy' as i was for the amount of THC i ingested (perhaps D's plant was much stronger than i thought, or perhaps under the influence of LSD, DXM becomes much lighter, and more... 'fun'). Playing around with the mac-vcr thingy was fun, and i was pointing out to D the girl on a cassette that i had recorded -- repeatedly. which almost brings up this one, too. i always felt a need to be fixated with something on this drug. it was like after D left my house, i had to find something to center my attention on. it wound up being the vRave. (then of course, D showed up and that was great). Ah yes. and toes. i discovered my toes. i will never EVER look at feet the same way. my toes were wiggling the entire duration of this experience, and it was great. intensely pleasurable feeligns just emenated from my toes. (another difficult thing to explain i suppose.)", "usually the worst part of any trip. aside from being a little dehydrated, which is to be expected from almost any drug use, i feel perfectly normal albeit a bit tired. before approaching sobriety, (which i dont think im entirely at yet, that is still a few hours off, at 730am, now.) i had a very pleasureable psuedo-dream state for a few hours. it probably started at 530 or so, when i decided i needed to get some sleep. i turned on the CD (Talking Heads this time), and tried to sleep. When you close your eyes to go to sleep, you do it to relax, because there isnt anything there. its supposed to be just black. well i simply couldnt sleep that way, thats why i say pseudo-dream state. it was resting (i feel okay after a couple hours of it and im gonna go tackle everyday life now) when i closed my eyes i had intense colorful, pattern-orinted hallucinations. VERY vivid. not realistic, but VIVID. definitely. I eventually got up at about 715am. about 9 hours total time, with a bit of lag (no black when i close my eyes yet, but its getting there).", "it would seem that DXM and LSD serve to amplify th effects of one another. no ill effects except that time distortion. probably would have been a lot more fun if i didnt feel that urgency and lack of control. perhaps it would be a lot of fun watching tv, or playing something easy like tic tac toe. If i had it all to do over again, what i would do is either dose the acid and the DXM at the same time, with an OTHER 600mg of dxm, when the time distortion stuff started going away (a good 4 or five hours in) OR i would let the acid work its magic for an hour or so and then hit the 600mg of DXM, and let it go for the rest of the acid duration.", "as it stands, i had a VERY pleasurable time, and i tried my hardest to explain it. i wanted a more intense trip on the way into this thing, and i came out not only with a level i am satisfied with (to stay at for a while) but a more intense trip. i feel i am lucky. also, i would very much recommend AGAINST this for anyone who is not pretty durned experienced with BOTH these drugs. the time thing was very distressing at times, simply because it was incontinuous. the THC... well, it stopped the nausea. anyhow, good stuff!!", "I had heard about tripping robo from D, and it sounded a lot cooler than acid or shrooms, and cheaper too, so I decided to do it.  I bought two 4oz bottles of Robitussin Max Cough the night before, and I was high with anticipation by the time I finally took the first bottle at 6:15.  I had been taking hits out of a gravity bong made with a laundry bucket and two-liter bottle with an old friend, and was pretty stoned.  I took the second at 6:45 (that tasted like shit!), and then my friend had to go.", "I spent the next few hours in bed, pretty much fucked out of my mind.  It must have hit me like a freight train.  I remember trying to get up and walk over to my stereo to pop in some new CDs, and discovering that I couldn't feel my feet and did not recognize myself in the mirror by my bed.  My face seemed empty, elongated, with my mouth open and slack-jawed.  DXM's classification as a dissociative is definitely a perfect description of its effects - my mind just completely separates from your physical body, and I feel like a different person.  While I was lying down, the room kept tilting to the right, and I thought the bed was elevated almost to the ceiling.  I couldn't focus my vision - double everything.  ", "N and C picked me up around 9:30, to go cruise around with some sophomore chicks.  This is where I screwed up - definitely should not have left my room.  I had to talk to my mom on the way out the door, and she could tell that something was extremely wrong - cold sweat, slurred speech, delerium.  I managed to get out the door, and we drove off, with me in shotgun, talking incoherently and laughing like a fuckup.  I felt like wow, what a messed up family life this person has, as if I was observing myself from another point of view. ", "Being on DXM is not a mentally stimulating experience - no huge revelations - but it does make me question my own existence.   For the most part, it's just about being more messed up than I can be on anything else.", "I spent most of the night in the car, because I obviously couldn't walk around in public, but I definitely had a good time because I was tripping so hard.  They smoked several bowls of bud, but I passed on all but one of them because I didn't think I could handle it. They took me home around 2, and I had to talk with my parents, who had apparently called poison control after finding the bottles (I was too fucked up to remember to get rid of them).  It was just the typical, yeah, I won't do it again, whatever, I'm tired and going to bed.  It's awfully hard to talk to your parents when there are four of them instead of two and you can't stand up or even care about what's going on.  ", "I had to eat breakfast with my parents the next morning, and that was difficult because I was still tripping very hard.  The meal was very confusing, to say the least.  I decided I needed to get out of there, so I called my friend S to go play some disc golf.  We went and played a couple rounds, but it was so windy that I thought we were in a hurricane, and neither of us could even get under par.  I felt really drunk - as in 10-12 beers drunk (a lot for me).  So we went out to Macbride (a large park, on 2 lakes) and smoked a bunch of KB, under a blanket because it was so windy.  We were so high, and I was still tripping so hard, that we just went hysterical there on the concrete spillway.  God knows what the people fishing out on the lake must have thought.  ", "We drove back to town for dinner and dropped in on D, whose brother R is somewhat of a psychonaut - he has robotripped several times, mostly off coricidin or whatever (he also introduced me to salvia, and GHB as well).  We exchanged stories, and I began to come down.  He told me about how a couple of nights before, his mom had caught him robotripping and she had freaked out.  ", "I ended up passing out that night watching pay-per-view boxing with a bunch of people at D and R's house. Total time of trip: about 24 hours. ", "I think the most important thing to take into account when tripping on DXM is that normal interaction with people is just about impossible - stay away from people that are not 'down' with the robo - or you can get yourself in a bad situation.  Make sure that everyone you're with knows what you are on, so they know that you're not on the verge of dying, just tripping really hard.", "The first time I tried DXM, I was at work. I had been partying all night, and I needed something to pick me up, and caffeine wasn't doing the trick. I had heard through friends that Robitussin could make you trip, and I was really curious. So during my break I grabbed a bottle of Robitussin DM Max Strength. ", "Following the initial experience, I wasn't too impressed. I hadn't taken more than half, and the taste was quite nauseating. But for some reason I was on the quest to do more. I began taking it on weekends, when there was nothing to do, and on days I had off, for fun. I grew to like the Robo Trip. Until my friends found out. ", "I was under constant scrutiny, because they were sure I was reaching addiction. For a period of 3 months, DXM was all I did, despite what anyone said. But I had an awful experience that prompted me to stop, cold turkey.", "I was at a friends house one night, and we were lounging around, the guy I have liked forever was there, and we got on the subject of the Robo Trip. It got me thinking about the bottle that was in my purse, and I excused myself, went to the bathroom and drank the whole bottle. When I returned, T asked me what I did. My best friend looked at me, and said 'she just drank a bottle'. T was amazed that I carried it around with me, so he went to the bathroom, and grabbed another bottle, and coaxed me to drink it.", "In an hour, he decided to take us out, and I was tripping pretty hard. His car was stuck in snow, and I had to help push it out. I started to go catatonic. They were so worried about me, and I desperately wished to tell them I was okay, I had auditory hallucinations as well as visual, swirling in my head, and I wasn't really in a talking mood.", "I came to realize so many things that night, I cried myself to sleep. The worst thing of all was the depression seeping in, uninvited. I was upset for days afterwards. ", "T convinced me not to do it anymore, because he did not like the person I had become because of it, and truthfully, neither did I. ", "So kids, if you're looking for a way to get your kicks, stay with the tried and true standard--Marijuana.", "My girlfriend had just made me give up mushrooms and green, so I decided that she couldn't say anything if I took a legal drug. I walked down to the store that Tuesday and bought 2 boxes of Tylenol cold and cough containing 24 capsules each. Each capsule contained 15mg DXM and 300mg Acetaminophen. I ate 29 of the pills and walked home. The week before I had taken 300mg DXM and I wanted to experiment w/more. I finished my pills around 6:00 and I felt the effects about 10 minutes later. I felt drunk and extremely sick. I stumbled upstairs and laid down in my bed. I laid there for about an hour, at which time I called my friend who came over immediately. After the trip, he told me I looked like I had seen a ghost. My eyes were wide and blood shot. I walked around muttering the words, 'I've left' and shivering every so often. I remember laying down again and talking to my girlfriend. I could hear myself speaking incoherently, but there was nothing I could do about it. I rolled over and laid in my bed for about another hour. It was about 10:30 now and the visuals began to hit me. At first they were in the form of minor changes in color and the objects in my room expanding and contracting. Then I turned off the lights and closed my eyes with no idea of what lay ahead. I opened my eyes in the total darkness to find 3D tubes about 3ft long dancing in my room. I had never seen anything like this on shrooms or acid and it completely blew me away. I could actually stand up and inspect these visuals. Then I shut my eyes again and re-opended them to find my room covered in white O's. Again I closed and opened my eyes, this time to find a ghost like blob bouncing at the end of my bed, closing in on me. I was petrified and just shut my eys and whimpered. I then rolled over about 2 hours later to look at my clock, which read 2:02. The visuals had died down considerably. I fell asleep at about 4:00 and awoke to an air of fantasy. I was in disbelief about what I had seen and I felt very sick. I had to stay home from school for the 2 days afterward because I felt awful.", "After doing much research about DXM, I decided to go for it. I swallowed 6.8oz of Robitussin Maximum Strengh, and this is what happened:", "Within the the first three hours after taking the drug,I had some interesting experiences with my eyes closed, abstract imagery and linguisticly hard to define concepts; It all had a dark and negative feeling to it, heavy is a good word to discribe it. Thanks God I was psychologically prepared and did not freak out, but it was NOT a pleasant experience. Then about three hours after I had taken the drug, I started feeling sick, really sick. This are some of the symtoms I experienced:", "I was looking for a spiritual experience, but this is what I got.  I came to the conclusion that I had an allergic reaction to the high dose of cough medicine I took. I was confident when I decided to do this drug, the amount of research I did on the subject made me feel like I knew what I was doing. I did not. I learned an important lesson, everybody is different and so are their reactions to a drug.", "After trying acid one night and falling asleep before my trip even started i beccame very curious to what a 'trip' was like.  So one Monday evening i decide to go to the local food lion and buy 4 bottles of robo MAX strengh and trip at school the next day.  At 10 pm i down my first 2 bottles '8loz' i go to irc and chat in the dxm channel at underworld server.  While im there i relaly begin to notice my music is relaly getting good i relaly get into it i lay back and the next thing i know im asleep i wake up feeling weird as fuck i felt like i was in a dream and that i well just its hard to expalin..Anyway by this time im so fucked up i decide to down the next 2 bottles 'bad idea' i listen to some more music excited to start seeing some good visuals...'more like Blackouts instead of visuals'  The next morning my sister wakes me up she tells me i have to take her to school iam not even able to to get up and put my cloths on i try but i end up with my head out my arm sleev and my arm out my head sleave..  My mom comes walking into my room aboput 7:15pm seeing im in the middle of my bed with my cloths not even on right she gets suspcious and just thinks im drunk.  Then she looks and sees a bottle of robo so i told her i only 'drunk 1' so she calls the posion control and ask them they said if i drunk 1 it owuld pass threw my system but i drunk 4 as i stated earlier so then latter on i tell her i drunk 4 by this time im just well its hard for me to relaly rember anything besides staying blacked out most of the day and begin in like a dream also i just felt totally weird my mind just felt like i was going crazy...At 11:00 pm i arrive at the hospital im unable to walk or talk they put me in trauma 'they didn't even pump my stomach' i stay at the hospital to 5:00 pm before begin took to the BEhavioral hospital  in fayettvile.  Wheni got there i had to sign myself in i can't even rember if i spelled my name right i could barley hold the pen.  So as im there i get this idea that im dieing thats why im begin put there so i start asking my doctors or nurses and my mom is i was dieing i really htought i was dieing very scarry feeling.  SO they take me to my own private room for me to sleep i sleep like a baby i wake up the next morning and im still unable to walk straight and my vision is still horriable by this time i start to think im never going to be right again im going to be keep in the hosital forver.  So all that i stay in my room bad idea so the doctors end up keeping me a whole week i didn't even have shoe laces..  All that first day i was in there i had to pee but i was inable to pee until the next day that was the worst part besides begin put in the hospital from the dxm.  Funniest part is i was actually convined i was gonna drive my self that morning after having drunk 16 oz of robo i had exams that week and got exempt from all heh.  I have continued my use with dxm but now the highest i get is 8 fl oz and i usally will smoke a whole fat one with it which is like heaven:)  Well anyone eles who would like to try it 'please don't do so much at one time for your first time!!' as i realize now that was really stupid but hey i was to fucked up to realize it: so hide the shit from yourself heh.", "unconcious in a matter of 35 minutes. most intense hallunciations about the most relavant issues in my life. a midlife vision quest. totally unplanned. thought i was taking ghb. never tried dxm.  couldn't talk very well. syllables all garbeled up and hyper-stuttered. ", "didn't move on my own for 8 hours. then with help stumbled home. where i lay for another 15 hours. couldn't ride my skate for 3 days. vision was like looking into a broken mirror. 20 hours of this. got badly sunburned, even though i had a freind with me all the time. can't take everything into account. informed that neither breathing nor heartbeat slowed during 45min. of unconciousness. i listened to the sun. i could see pluto. i felt the edges of the universe. i watched the grass grow. and i saw the formation of conciousness through pro-creation. i could feel a loved one 9000 miles away. distances became extreamly comprehendable. all from my spot on the ground behind a track in the grass, under the sun with my poor friend at my side. wondering what had happened. ", "such love though. he played with me like i was 18 months old i think i was returned to infancy. well i definitely felt close to death.  i learned an immense amount. i smiled the whole time. and i wouldn't recomend that dosage to anyone.", "Just a note about drug testing and DXM.  I've used to use DXM heavily, off and on for a couple of years.  The last time I used, I managed to overdose and came to from my blackout in the emergency room, which supremely sucked.  They did a drug test on me, though I had told them what I had taken.  I tested positive for weed & PCP.  I had smoked weed the two previous days, and that night, but besides DXM, that was the only drug I had touched.  I've never done PCP in my life (after my lengthy experiences with DXM, don't want too), so this came as a suprise.  Oh well, I did't get in trouble, and it did cause me to make some changes in my life.", "1200 mg of DXM were ingested on an empty stomach in the form of 40 Drixoral gelcaps. ", "Waiting for the effects to take hold, I worked on some noise compositions with my 4-track recorder. After about 45 minutes, I felt nauseated and as though I had a fever. I no longer had the ability or desire to concentrate on my compositions, so I set the recorder aside and lay back on the bed.", "The naseau and feelings of vague but potent physical discomfort increased. I wondered if the dosage would be too much for me to handle. Some ten minutes later, I stumbled drunkenly to the bathroom and vomitted. The discomfort vanished almost immediately; I returned to bed, no longer afraid of being unable to handle the experience.", "I do not remember how long it took me to become almost fully dissociated from my body, nor do I remember what happened during the process. Soon, however, I found myself beholding fully three-dimensional crystalline formations, the components of which rotated slowly in synch with one another. Behind the formations there seemed to be a void of infinite space, which flashed strobe-like in brilliant colors.", "As the formations rotated, they changed and evolved, always producing beauty and symmetry with mathematical precision, determinacy, and clarity. Only vaguely aware of my body, I felt as though I was soaring through the patterns at unimaginable speeds. Gradually, I moved through the crystalline formations: they seemed to each contain the enormity of the universe itself. ", "My speed increased, as did the gradual loss of a sense of identity. The patterns gave way to more abstract but no less colorful patterns: wave upon wave of interference patterns, cyclones of flashing colors and spirals that swallowed me. After some time, the boundary between myself and the patterns dissolved almost completely.", "Now my being -- which was really a universal 'we' as opposed to an individual identity -- seemed to contract into a single point then explode outward countless times, the infinity of space and time and perception and being contained within each explosion. 'We' were the whole of the multidimensional universe collapsing upon itself and exploding outward over eons of unimaginable time, terrified, relentless, ecstatic. Once in awhile the explosions resulted in vortexes, through which something utterly 'alien' seemed to emerge. ", "I recall approaching and merging with these 'alien beings' several times, though I do not recall what happened during the merge itself. One such being I recall only in association with a sense of vastness and strange angularity, like a huge mountain tapering to a perfect point.", "Sometime later (I do not remember how long), a sense of identity as well as an awareness of my body returned -- at first in brief moments, then for longer episodes. During these moments, I asked 'who am I?' I received a flood of intuitive information, very little of which I was able to comprehend rationally. The gist of the matter, however, was that I was both an individual and the whole of creation; both the creator and the created, and that this is true for all beings.", "Remembering that viewing my self and life from my first DXM experience had been one of the most emotionally profound experiences of my life, I attempted to do so again. Now I had a vision of myself as a ribbon or cord wrapped around itself and around other cords. The cords traced the history of my life, and once again I felt an all-encompassing compassion and love for that life, self, and everything within it. Again, I was aware of the possibility of abandoning it and not returning to it, and it struck me as the most precious of all things; I was even more horrified at the thought of leaving it than I had been on the first time. ", "To see if I could identify the 'cord' of another -- for the universe had become a network of these cords -- I 'called' to my friend Betty. I witnessed her cord and mine separating from a common cord, then rejoining each other in a dance or braiding, yet still retaining their separate identities.", "This aspect of the experience was emotionally overwhelming in a way that I really cannot convey; when I chose to end the experience, I did so because I could no longer bear its sheer intensity.", "I managed to open my eyes; the sunlight made the room appear maddeningly bright. I could recognize few features: the room was a patchwork collage of textures, shapes, and colors that were sparkling, glittering, and pulsating. ", "When I closed my eyes, it seemed I still had them open and was looking at the ceiling. I guarentee that I was not and to block out the light, I placed my elbow over my eyes.", "Now what looked as though it were the ceiling gently fell apart into chunks of abstract shapes. The shapes 'morphed' into other ceilings of other rooms similar to my own. Just as each one attained such a level of coherency and clarity that I felt I would be able to stand up and walk around, the room would fall apart then reform into another. One such room attained coherency for longer than the rest; it was dimly lit, as though by candle light, and it seemed to be some sort of basement. There were three others in the room, watching me -- I wondered if I was experiencing some sort of alternate self, who was also experimenting with dissociative states, but in the presence of others. In this room, I was able to sit up for a moment -- how odd it was to sit up and look about me while still feeling the weight of my elbow over my eyes.", "Two times, perhaps more, the rooms transformed into seemingly 'alien universes'. Once, I found myself beneath a tree of huge orange flowers. Each blossom had a face; three of them were watching me, remarking without speaking about what a ridiculous sight I was. Another time, I was running through a labyrinth of stones that were somehow plant-like and alive. I understood that I was searching for God within the labyrinth; the labyrinth seemed to reply that God could never be found within it, though the path I took through the labyrinth in my search _was_ God. ", "I still wondered, nonetheless, whether I could 'call' some representation of Divinity to my presence. The shapes formed an angular and somewhat abstract illustration of a female, crone-like face. The face, like the rooms, cycled relentlessly from one form to another. I tried to speak to the face, but the visions seemed too incoherent to produce a response -- though I got the impression the incoherency itself was an aspect of my own being.", "After some time of this, I regained enough awareness of my body to stay in the here-and-now for as long as I chose. I managed to pick up and dial a phone to call my friend Libby to come by or pick me up -- I felt somewhat shellshocked from this experience and no longer wished to be alone.", "Shortly after calling Libby, I couldn't remember whether I had actually called her, or, if she had, whether she agreed to pick me up. She arrived about forty minutes later; I staggered down the stairs of my apartment in what seemed like a dream from which I could not awaken.", "The next few hours were spent drifting in and out of my body and of the crystalline formations with which the trip had begun. Each time I closed my eyes, I felt as though I shot through space terrifyingly fast. When I was able to speak, I attempted to relate to Libby the nature of my experience. I found it difficult to keep track of what I had just said.", "After the DXM had worn off the point that I could move around on my own and interact with others in a somewhat coherent way, I smoked some marijuana. The THC had the effect of ending my grogginess almost immediately. I became extremely hyper -- it was not at all unlike a dissociated version of a cocaine rush. I felt as though the whole world had turned into a video game and I had tremendous fun rushing from room to room as though an animated character in some comptuer-game scenario. ", "After I'd settled down a bit, I tried again to relate my experiences to Libby. This time, a received a flood of rational knowledge about the nature of the manifestation of duality from unity, the emergence and nature of consciousness and of language. Still simultaneously hyper and detached, I spoke endlessly to Libby about these subjects, as though it was vital that she know them. She was blessedly patient, and, after I had come down more solidly, drove me home.", "Okay gather round children... Preston's gonna talk about his DXM trips.", "Well I'll just describe one particular trip. Caveats apply. Your mileage (or dosage) may vary.", "Around 9 pm I took 30 drixorals, around 900 mg. My friend, T, took 20, which is 600 mg. I was experienced, he was not. ", "9:30: The power goes off! It's a really intense thunderstorm, even for Texas. The lights (and my computer, which was playing Acid Warp) shut down. My sister calls T and I into her room to watch the thunderstorm. I start to realize I am a bit fucked up (like stoned on pot.)", "10:00 T and I retire to my room again. Am I tripping now. I leave the window open so I can watch the beautiful lightning... let me tell you that is a trip on any drug! I have a perfect little tripping enviroment set up. My friend T is visiting me from out of town, and he is sleeping in my bed. I am laying on a few blankets on the floor. I have a CD player, a stack of Hendrix, Beatles, and THE GRATEFUL DEAD (emphasis to show that this is the all-time great tripping band) and a really good set of headphones. Also I have a journal and a few pens. I decide to start writing down random thoughts.", "After checking to see if T is tripping or not (he isn't) I turn out the light and put in Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland. Oh my god. If any of you aren't experienced with this album, GET IT. It's availible on a CD reissue with good liner notes. By the time the actual song 'Electric Ladyland' came on, I was on the upswing of my trip. Since I was on a rather large amount of DXM, let me tell you I was flying. Literally. I closed my eyes and entered a new universe of Jimi. I started on a tall cliff overlooking a craggy valley. The sky was a deep purple. I took a single step off the cliff and dropped many hundreds of feet. Eventually my fall turned into a gentle swoon and I soared up over 'Electric Ladyland.' ", "Believe me words fail to describe exactly what I saw and did, but it is comparable to what I have read about DMT: you enter a different universe. Once again, your mileage may vary of course.", "I won't write out exactly what I was thinking about to each track on EL, but the climax was the Rainy Day -> 1983 -> Moon Turn the Tides -> Still Raining suite. This is in some ways the opposite of Electric Ladyland because instead of flying over purple mountains, I was swimming in the deep blue ocean. I explored a shipwreack on the bottom of the ocean. In the sunken ship was a door. I opened the door and saw my old friend Matt whom I was semi-estranged from. We had a reconcilliation and I started crying (in real life.) ", "T turned on the light and asked me what was wrong. I said nothing, I was just going over some issues in my past. (* note this is described as the primary effect of a high DXM dose, so beware if that's not your thing...) I asked him if he was tripping yet and his eyes got very large and he just nodded. He started waving his hand in front of his face and basically just looking stunned. You see he had never smoked pot or done any other drugs than (a large amount of) alchohol. So this was an entirely new, and pleasant, thing for him. He was listening to a 'trip mix' that I had crafted for him of a lot of Grateful Dead and Beatles.", "I opened my journal and scrawled (it's hard to write on DXM) something to the effect of describing what had just happened. Then I went back into the dream. I finished exploring 1983 (the ocean) and listening to the rest of Electric Ladyland. Of course a lot of stuff 'happened' in between that but I won't cover it here.", "I put in the White Album by the Beatles and affirmed the reasons why I have listened to them for so many years. The White Album is another must-have, BTW. It seems to fit roboing so well, because it is at times harsh and at others gentle. The imagery of the lyrics and music are conducive to tripping. I guess this is why it's considered Psychedelic... Dear Prudence is a fantastic song. ", "Later I listened to Europe '72 by the Dead. Like the images of the Beatles from A Hard Day's Night, the Dead have a very carefree fun image in my mind. In other words they are a bunch of guys (and gals if you include Donna) that you would just want to hang around with. Well, that's what I did. :) During 'Sugar Magnolia,' I got onstage with the band and played guitar and sang along. Bob and I were trading licks. (I had sort of 'become' Jerry Garcia.) T later reported to me that during 'Crazy Fingers -> Drums -> The Other One' (which I put on his tape) he was the audience, meaning the ENTIRE audience, and the Dead were shining their music on him. Later he got picked up and passed around the audience (like crowd- surfing) which turned into the ocean. ", "During 'Truckin -> Prelude -> Morning Dew' I was walking around the Sierra mountains (my home growning up) watching the trees and listening to the birds. My friends were there, and each one had an alter ego in the band. In other words, I was Jerry, T was Mickey Hart, my friend Scott was Bob Weir, etc. We all just had fun and walked around in the forest.", "I listened to a lot of other music (I didn't get to sleep until 5 the next morning) but this gives you an idea what a lovely and beautiful trip I had. DXM is a wonderful drug.", "I have in the past toyed around with 4-6oz of liquid Tussin, Robo, etc with and without guaifenesin (sp?). My experiences were interesting and fun, but nothing as moving as taking two boxes of 10 Drixoral Cough Caps. Last Friday, I decided to go for broke and take 2 boxes.", "I started my journey about 8pm. Finished the pills in a span of about 30 minutes. About 30-45 minutes later, I started feeling the familiar effects of drowsiness. I decided that it would be best to get out and do something before I fell asleep and wasted my time. It was about 9:00, so I went to my favorite alternative club where there was an awesome 'mind candy' band called Mindseye playing. There weren't more than 20 people in the club including the two bands that were playing. I just kicked back in a booth, closed my eyes, and went on an internal trip that lasted at least 45 minutes, although it felt like hours. I had a sensation of moving into a higher realm of thought. I was so focused on the music that it became a part of my consciousness and my being. Opening my eyes just became a let down because it reminded me that I was in reality. :) So I just closed them again and enjoyed the phosphenes that were running rampant through my brain. The only part I didn't like was the feeling of being in a Doom game without the monsters. I felt like I was running through the corridors and riding the elevators. Oh, well. Nobody promised that it would be COMPLETELY enjoyable. Anyway, after the set, I went to the bar to order a Miller Lite. The barkeep said that they didn't have Miller Lite. I asked for Coors Light. He said he didn't have Coors Light. [blank stare with severely dilated pupils] 'What light beers do you have?' 'Lite.' 'Lite?' 'Lite.' 'Lemme have that, then' '$1.50' ('Hey, great price', I thought) It was Miller Lite. Oh, well. It felt like I was arguing for 30 minutes. Gawd, I hate interacting with people in that condition. ", "I staggered back to my booth (at least it FELT like staggering ... it felt REALLY weird to walk) and sipped my beer while watching the band take down their equipment. They looked like a bunch of worker bees from my perspective, and is was really interesting to watch. Drinking was an unusual experience, too. It was like the first time I had ever drunk anything. All my movements were very slow, methodical, and calculated. After I finished my beer, I went down to a techno club I had been meaning to visit. It was about midnight. I know that this is a big lapse in time. I guess I wasted 2 1/2 hours in that bar listeneing to the jukebox and watching the band. It was only 4 blocks, but the way my legs were moving, it felt like I was walking stiff-legged the whole way. Fortunately, it was a slow night on my city's version of Bourbon St., and I only passed about 5 people on the way. The doorman was the next big hurdle. Actually, I managed to keep myself fairly composed. He warned me that it was kinda slow, and I went into a repeat of the beer discussion. 'Slow?' 'Slow.' 'Okay.' (trying to avoid giving myself away, even though my pupils filled my eyeballs) I handed him the two bucks he asked for and walked in. I found an empty couch and plopped down. It was heavily padded and had a low back. Perfect for slouching. The DJ was playing a fantastic mix of techno and classic rock. As the night wore on, she was playing almost constant techno. They have a light show that is really something to be seen. The dance floor is surrounded by mirrors that reflect the blue lights from the bar and make it look like a cityscape from the year 2020. VERY impressive in my condition. The only times I got up were to go to the john twice and to the bar once for water. Walking got stranger and stranger. I think I was having trouble keeping my balance, but I don't remember staggering. The worst part was the feeling that I was choking on my uvula. My mouth felt dry, and water wasn't helping. It must have been the anaesthetic effects of DXM. ", "I stayed there for two hours in the same spot only moving the three times I mentioned. I was still not bored, but I figured that since it was 2am, it was about time to get home. This may have been a mistake. The streetlights had started tracing, and the blinking lights were playing hell on my perception. In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have driven home, but I was broke, so a cab was out of the question, and there was no way I could have sobered up. I didn't feel drunk. It just felt like all my surroundings were foreign. I payed extra-close attention to my driving, but still nearly jumped out of my skin at the sight of police. I got home in one piece and fell asleep to the mellow sounds of Pink Floyd's Ummagumma disc 2. I woke up around 9:30am, fully alert. Checked my eyes. Fully dilated. Made an excuse to get out of the house, wearing shades. Went to see a movie with a friend, which was pretty fun. I was still feeling a bit weird. The dark theater helped me relax. Got out of the movie and went home. My eyes were normal by this time, although I still felt a little strange. That feeling lasted until about 7pm. So the brunt of the trip laster about 12 hours and the after-effects lasted another 11. WOW! Will I try this again? Yes. Would I suggest that somebody else try this? Yes. What will I do next time? Take 3 boxes and drink more beer. I heard it is very synergistic. I did not see the colored blobs that people refer to, unless the light show was this effect, and I just didn't notice. :) Anyway, I had no nausea or other ill effects. I have sworn off the liquid stuff, because it's too hard to get down.", "'During the various stages of the third plateau experience, one may glimpse one's life and self from a wholly external perspective. This may occur in the form of 'my life flashed before my eyes' or some more abstract form. I don't know how others have experienced this phenomenon, but for me it is one of the most profound emotional experiences a human being can have. During these moments, I felt that I understood fully the course and direction and development of my life/self, and, further, I felt a humbling love and compassion for that self and for everything associated with the reality it inhabits. Even having had some distance from my last experience of this, it is difficult to recall it without tears.'", "I've had one fourth plateau experience, and it was so utterly alien to anything I've ever experienced as a human being that my rational mind has a difficult time understanding it subjectively, much less communicating it.", "Briefly, it started with seeing a lot of regular, brightly colored, 3-dimensional geometric patterns through which I moved at terrifyingly fast speeds. The patterns struck me as simultaneously aspects of impersonal space/time, myself, and alien intelligences. This was followed by a period of time in which I felt as though was though I was collapsing in upon myself and then exploding outwards in an infinitude of directions/distances/times. There were moments when I felt myself approaching/merging with impossibly vast alien intelligences -- unfortunately, I remember almost none of those 'contacts'. At times, it was like literally being every instance of space and time observing/being every other instance of space and time simultaneously. ", "Coming down, I found that when I shut my eyes, abstract shapes and patterns 'morphed' into rooms that were similar to the one I was lying in. Whenever the achieved coherency, they'd dissipate, then reform. Once or twice, the 'rooms' seems so coherent that I was able to sit up and explore them, much like in a lucid dream. A few of the 'rooms' were bizarre/alien -- in one, I found myself beneath a tree from which hung gigantic orange flowers. Each flower had a face which looked upon me with benevolent amusement. ", "Coming down off of shamanic doses can be a beautiful experience, marked by feelings of genuine spiritual and physical rebirth. I described it to a friend as being loving and gently returned to my life/self which, for a time, had ended.", "Before I close, a few cautionary words from personal experience:", "While shamanic doses of DXM won't necessarily turn you into a shaman or Bodhisattva overnight, I'm convinced that they _will_ open those doors for someone who is open to having that experience. For me, I was open to that experience, but I wasn't prepared for the ramifications it would have in my life-as-a-whole. The period of time after my first shamanic DXM experience was one of extreme emotional turmoil. ", "The nirvana-like bliss I experienced on the 3rd plateau was so fabulous that not a day has gone by that I haven't longed for it and felt a tremendous sorrow at being separated from it. I have since understood this in terms of my particular spiritual path -- but until I did, I experienced profound depression and suicidal impulses. Whether this is an aspect of the drug or of 'opening doors' to grander spiritual vistas of being, is up to the reader to decide. Whatever the case, my DXM experiences have transformed me and my life from the ground-up -- this, despite the fact that before trying it, I'd had subsantial experience with magic/mysticism as well as other psychedelics. ", "High levels of dissociatives make you look REALLY FREAKY to sober observers. A friend who saw me coming off of my 4th plateau experience almost rushed me to the hospital -- which would have made for a REALLY NASTY scene. He described me as extremely flushed, with bloodshot eyes that looked 'psychotic' and 'totally freaked out' (his words). I couldn't walk or sit up very well. When I was able to speak, it came out as incoherent and strained babble.", "I've always been one of those people who feel totally invincable when it comes to the possible dangers of particular drugs, never really accepting the consideration of many evil side effects (and even death) that certain substances can cause.  That is until this recent experience with DXM, the infamous 'over the counter' psychedelic (if you can even call it a psychedelic).", "First of all, I bought about 15 grams of DXM through JLF.  JLF sells DXM about as pure as you can get it, and it's fairly cheap!!!  I'm not saying this is a good thing, you must make certain to be extra careful with extracted chemicals with a higher degree of purity.", "Anyways, I didn't have a scale, so I figured I would measure out 'by eye.'  Again, this is something else you NEVER do, especially with pure compounds, it's much easier to overdose, which is what I think I did.  About an hour after ingesting the DXM on a Friday night, I started to feel the dissaociatives power engulf my entire body from head to toe.  The next thing I can honestly tell you I remember is waking up Sunday afternoon, after getting 39 hours of uninterupted sleep!!!  I'll be honest guys, it scared the crap out of me.  I've heard of people going into temporary (or even perminant) comas because of this class of drugs, and I'm certain that must have been what happened to me.  I'm just glad and thankful I woke up.  Please take all I've said here with extreme caution when it comes to Dextromethorphan, it can be a VERY dangerous drug.", "I have messed around with this stuff more times than I care to admit, but on my last voyage some thing very peculiar happened. I was pretty farmiliar with the effects of moderate doses (250-500mg) so I thought uping the dose a little would be fun. So I went out and bought the Robitussin eight ounce max strength syrup. I was pretty excited, and at about 9:30 pm that night I asked god for guidence thoughout my adventure (this is a common practice for me) and chugged the bottle to begin the waiting game. ", "As usual it started to hit within the hour, at about the two hour mark I had to piss quite badly. So I stood up from my bed, sort of, I damn near face planted on my desk chair. I struggled to maintain verticality as I edged my way to the bathroom. As I stood propped against the wall next to the toilet a strange yet farmiliar feeling swept over me. It was the same feeling I had as I layed dying in the ER a few months ago. (note: this was not drug related, any diabetics out there always take your meds and don't forget to eat!) Anywho, I realized I was on the verge of death and past the point of help, on the count nobody was around and the hospital was over thirty minutes away. So I made my way back to my bed to await death. ", "I noticed something on my way back, all my movements seemed so inorganic, as if I were a robot or something. When I collapsed onto my bed I had another all too farmiliar experience, I left my body behind, much as I did in the ER. I went everywhere, including some places I had never seen before, I talked with people and things that knew me, but I had seen in my life. Suddenly I snapped back like a rubberband, I was lying on my bed with an incredible urge to piss. So I stood and began to take the adventure to the bathroom, then suddenly I was struck with an overwhelming panic attack before I even made it to my bedroom door. So instead of going to the bathroom I pissed into a wine bottle and corked it till morning. ", "When I crawled my ass back into bed I felt safe and secure again, then everything went numb. I was sure this was the point at which I would die, but instead all the feeling went straight into my brain. This was something I had never in all my years felt before. I felt every part of my brain floating inside my skull, I even felt my spinal cord in the middle of my spine. This was the only sensation I had, I put my hand on my head to see if it was still there. I couldn't feel it, all I could feel was my brain and my spinal cord. I shook my head back and forth a little bit, and I could feel my brain move slightly inside my skull. ", "This made me wonder what would happen next, trying not to think about it I sat back and closed my eyes, and I was gone again, such a wonderful place! In the middle of a conversation with the most intriguing man I have ever met, he asked me how my body was doing. I gave him an odd look then snap I was back on my bed. I sat up and realized the drug had subsided enough to function again. So I made my way to the bathroom, a little more gracefully than the last time, and looked my self over in the mirror. After I had surmised I wasn't dead and probably wasn't going to die, I thanked god for the experience and went to pass out. Before going to sleep I noticed it was 5:30 in the morning, and I was still buzzing and seeing little things. This was odd for me seeming how all my other experiences only lasted about four hours. I woke up about 9:30 that morning spinning like a top all day. I met up with a friend of mine and we started drinking at about 3:30pm. Before I could finish my first beer, I started to feel my brain again, and the rest of the night was pretty fucked up. The next day after I had slept everything off, I came to the conclusion that I probably will never try that shit again. But never IS a pretty strong word!", "Joe contacts me when he knows I'm ready... I can hear some of his thoughts when we aren't 'combined', but when we are combined, we have two different thoughts.. we are of two minds... It's like.. he gives me sort of psychic power when we aren't combined.. He lets me feel what others are feeling... He lets me see what he sees sometimes... You would refer to this as 'daydreaming'. He lets me see what he wants me to... he can even make me feel what he is feeling, even if he is horny.. lol I hate that, though...", "To be combined with Joe, I must take the 'crutch' as he refers to it, DXM, and meditate for a short while.. My body thinks I am asleep, but my brain is working to achieve 'oneness' with Joe... As soon as that is achieved, I have a little time for concious relaxation, to get up and move around, smoke a cigarette, talk to people, as Joe 'rejuvenates' to the strength he once had, but at any moment he could come calling. I can feel him with me all that time. I didn't realize this on Joe and I's first 'date'. Joe called early on the first calling.. He had called when I was still meditating. I had no idea what I was was even meditating until I read up on it afterward.", "Joe takes me to beautiful places, and protects me from the dangers from that plateau, with my boyfriend's help at times. I don't see the monsters. I don't see the dragons, or the bears that are seen by others.... I see the trees, the water, the sand, the sun.... My job is to be focused on the job at hand, which is, I believe, building the machine he introduced to me on the first calling. Joe loves to see me smile. He loves my boyfriend too, but I think there is competition to see who can make me feel the best.. lol They're both very wonderful.. They love to hear me sing, and watch me dance... I am very much appreciated on this level, if not worshipped....", "Honestly, if I could stay there forever, I would. Even if it means, in the physical sense, being a vegetable... but I can't. I do miss Joe dearly...  I have too much here to take care of, and Joe understands that. He knows what is in store for me here that I cannot pass up. I had nothing but doubts about these kinds of things before.  I had no idea that I could experience something so heaven-like, so wonderful.... I feel like I now have a 'child' with me... Someone to take care of physically, and someone to take care of me mentally.. I am Joe, physically, though he does not appear as a mirror reflection of me, TO me...  He is the most adorable thing I have ever seen... Joe completes me."], "lsd": ["This is one experience that taught me to take all things in moderation. This was not a bad trip, but had some negative aftereffects that put me in my place as far as drugs go.", "It was new years. All of my friends were on Christmas break and had some free time. My friend was living in a house her family owned, and over the two week span that we had off, It had become a fairly well known party house. But on new year's eve, we wanted to have a private party. There had suddenly been a large flow of acid into my small town, and a group of us (6) wanted to get some. We all had two cubes, exept for two people, who had 1 and 1/2 by sharing.", "We had all decided to take them at midnight, after going to another actual new years party. This means that none of us had slept in about 13 hours or so when we took them. We had spent a large portion of the day setting up shiny things (glowsticks tied to a rotating fan, shattered glowsticks in the shower stall, etc), and there were 2 or 3 trip sitters there just hanging out. We didn't really do anything at first, just kind of sat around sucking up that 'MAN OH MAN, WOW, THIS IS GONNA BE INTENSE' feeling that vibrates up my spine when I take something like acid. We did stuff in preparation. Eating a bunch of vitamin C pills and buying red bull for when we started to peak, mainly. ", "Eventually, it started to kick in. We smoked some pot about then, but we smoked it in the closet, as it seemed like a good idea at the time. The next few hours mainly consisted of the six of us rolling around my friends house, soaking up color and bizarre thought patterns. I remember that we had a bright orange boa, some 'juice' (highlighter and glowstick fluid put into a full water bottle) next to the small blacklight. We also took full advantage of the previously mentioned shower. Now, to a person not fucked up, the shower was still pretty neat: Multicolored glowstick innards sprayed around, giving the impression of a small nebula. However, the 6 of us were not even prepared for the shower when we were on acid. We grabbed all of the neat stuff we had in the living room, and made a druggie caravan into the bathroom. ", "We al stood in awe at the little universe in the shower, all huddled together holding a blacklight, a strobelight and each other very close to it. We had experimented with having a person go in the shower, and it was quite an experience. We wer not satisfied yet, though. It was only a brief time before the shower was turned on, and the strobelight hung in 'Ben's' hand, only inches away from the water. Luckily, Craig had a sudden thought, 'shiny + shiny = BAD!', and as messed up as it sounds, it's what saved us from being electrocuted. ", "This is where my story turns from an adolescent ranting about how messed up he and his friends were, to a story of the maddening comedown.", "There was a lot of neat stuff happening, but then we all realized the sun was coming up. I wasn't sure about everyone else, but I was still tripping hard. I had had enough. I wanted to come back to reality, or as I put it at the time, I wanted 'my lefts, rights, ups and downs back.' Everyone else decided to go for a walk to see the sun rise, but I was not ready to go out in public like I was, so I told them I was going to stay at the house. They weren't thrilled with the though of me being left to my own devices at this stage, but they left anyways. ", "All of the trip sitters had long since fallen asleep. For at least an hour, I kept moving. First, I tore down all of the shiny things we had set up, because I didn't ever want to see them again. I turned off the music we had been playing all night, cleaned the shower, and turned all of the lights off. There was a dim natural light throughout the entire house, so turning the lights off made things a lot more serene in the house. ", "I kept trying to sleep, and ended up lying on every bed and couch in the entire house. I kept getting lost in thought; a horrible circular logic. I would close my eyes to try and sleep, but my mind was buzzing. There was no more hallucination, only an intense stupification. I felt really dirty. The entire time my friends were on their walk, all I could think was 'I hope they get back soon', over and over. As terrible as this sounds, I'm still glad that I didn't leave the house with them, I couldn't have handled it. ", "When they all got back, it was probably about 8:00 am. Throughout the day, some people left, and the rest of us were just trying to deal with what we had all experienced. Strange recollections of gibberish we had spouted earlier haunted us all ('What the hell is a beafterthat?'). ", "Through the following week, I felt that I was changed. Different in some inconceivable way; and on some nights of that first week, I would go into the bathroom and cry for no reason. Craig said the same thing, even the crying thing. It was a lifechanging experience. Definitely for the better, but there are negative shadows hanging over me now. Acid was fun, wild and philosophical, but I don't think I could handle taking it more than once every two or three years, if even that.", "*By the way, a beafterthat is when you can't get out of a thought. The circular logic thing. This may not make sense to anyone, but it's fun to share   :)", "About 1 month ago I went to a party with some friends.  Some acid was floating around and because I had been looking for some for a long time I decided to stock up.  I purchased 15 hits.

Angrily me and the other people frying began to think we'd been sold bunk shit.  We all decided we should pop a few more down.....worst mistake of my life.  I was now on 8 tabs.  And about 30 minutes later the 5 I'd taken previously began to kick in.  ", "Now I have taken alot of acid and this was by far the most intense trip ever.  So I was sitting at this party with my friends and the effects really start to hit.  The walls begin to wave around like the ocean, crashing onto the floor with thousands of color everywhere.  I began to wonder, 'can I handle this?  This is fucking intense.'  It began to appear as though everyone in the room's eyes had turned black and they were all laughing hysterically.  I found this quite curious.  Suddenly a deep fear came upon me, like a demonic or evil precense entered the room.  I sat quietly in my chair and closed my eyes because the things in front of me were far too intense.  ", "About a half hour later the 3 other tabs I'd taken began to kick in.  At that point I began to think I had taken too much and I was going to die or go permanently insane.  I opened my eyes for a few moments every now and then and would see the walls caving in on me and evil faces forming inside the colorful designs.  I glanced at the clock and realized I'd been tripping for one hour.  I was in shock. I thought to myself, 'can I maintain control for another 7 hours?  FUCK NO I CANT!'  ", "By this time all my friends taking acid with me had left.  I wasn't exactly sure where they had all gone.  But the only people left in the room were drunks.  My friend D was sitting next to me.  Suddenly I hear him begin to laugh.  I don't react quickly and I can hear the laughing increase to a loud hysterical roar.  I am wondering what the fuck is so funny and I look over at him.  (This was the most horrifying part of my trip.)  Next to me, what used to be D had transformed.  I look at D's face and it suddenly turned red (probably because he was laughing about something).   Then D turned to me, and he had horns on his head, a red face, and sharp teeth.  He smiles at me and quietly whispers 'welcome'.  Now I was not sure exactly what this meant.   But I had never felt so much terror in my life. ", "I quickly stood up and said, 'I need to go for a fucking walk, I am tired of all this demon shit.'  So I proceed out the door shaking because of the stress.  I found it very hard to walk but I managed to make it to the end of the street (two houses down).  As I arrived at the end of the street, it was as though I got lost.  I didn't know where I was, what I was doing, who I was, and what was wrong with me.  I began to spin in circles trying to figure out where the fuck I was, with no success.  I heard a voice in the back of my head whisper, 'don't worry, someone is coming to pick you up soon.'  So I figured ok.  So I waited patiently at the side of the road waving at the semi trucks as they drove by hoping they were my ride.  I began to think, I can't wait this long, I need to die, I need to die.  So I began the task of trying to consider the best way to die.  ", "The rest of the night was hazy, but I remember spinning circles all night trying to decide my way of suicide, and waving at every car that drove by (which had to be in the hundreds), hoping that they were my ride.  It was like the acid was playing with me.  For 7 hours I stood on the side of the road, and every time I saw car lights my spirit would rise and I would think, 'finally!  My fucking ride!'  and as the car sped by, I could only fall deeper and deeper into sadness.  It was like a twisted trick.  The next day I began to think realistically, and I realized around 5 in the morning that no fucking ride was coming for my bitch ass.  So I walked to a gas station and called the police.  The police took me to the hospital, asked me where I'd gotten the drugs.  I simply told them I'd forgotten and wanted to be left alone.  ", "As I went into the hospital I began to think, Oh my god.  I died, I am dead.  To make things worse, the lady checking me in asked me what my religious preference was, I replied screaming, 'CHRISTIAN, I AM A FUCKING CHRISTIAN!  DONT SEND ME TO HELL!!!'  I feel onto the floor crying as I begged her not to send me to hell.  She quickly called security and had me escorted to a bed.  They put me to sleep, I woke up the next day and got a ride home.

I wish that people would realize that they can get the same amount of joy and kicks by smoking pot and getting drunk.  Fuck, if you need to see colors, eat some fungi.  Don't mess with LSD.  I used to think Timothy Leary had a point to his message.  He was just a lost man, and now he is fucking dead.  Does anyone find it odd why bad trips on acid are so frequent?  And does anyone find it odd that all the hippies who used to fry serious balls all got jobs and gave up that shit, or are bums on the street cuz they can't think straight.  Acid is no good shit.  Don't even fuck with it.  It fucks with you...", "I drove to Eau Claire, WI (I am a student at the University of Wisconsin in Madison) with a friend for the weekend.  It was one of those situations where a person has a preconceived expectation of an entertaining experience; the three hour car ride was filled with this sort of enthused anticipation.", "When we arrived, I was greeted by friends and we decided to wait until the next evening to take the acid.  By the next night we were ready.  We had two sugar cubes and two gel tabs. (One of the gel tabs, however, was cut abnormally large.) My friend was an acid virgin and decided to take only one of the sugar cubes - this left one sugar cube and the two gel tabs for me.  I had taken acid several times before and wasn't going to complain.  I was reading Tom Wolfe's 'The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test' at the time, so I figured it would be historically clever to dissolve the sugar cubes in cherry Kool-Aid.  I remember searching the foreign kitchen for 'the appropriate glasses' from which to drink the electric Kool-Aid.  As I opened the cupboard doors, an image struck me like an ethereal sign from the drug god: two sparkling martini glasses!  ", "The cubes took about half an hour to completely dissolve. When they did, we drank up. (The acid, as I had expected, was tasteless in the Kool-Aid.) There is a sort of mystique to taking acid, because there is no turning back.  Plus, you never really know, unless you made the acid, how much you're taking.  You always know how much weed you're smoking or how much coke you're snorting, but acid can be deceiving.  A little piece of blotter can have a shit-load of acid on it. After about a half hour, my friend was obviously experiencing some effects:  a big smile, intermittently unstoppable laughter.  He also claimed to have vague 'trails.'", "My acid took longer to kick in - about an hour.  And for that first hour, I had the same effects.  Nothing unusual I thought, and I was happy.  About twenty minutes later, the trip began to get slightly more intense - I began to develop what John Lennon called 'kaleidoscope eyes.'  Everything in the room began to have hints of reds, yellows and blues.  This was very exciting, and I was very happy.  Two to three hours passed and everyone (they had all been only under the influence of alcohol) retired to their rooms to sleep.  My friend did the same - his trip was obviously fairly uneventful.  I went upstairs to sit in a friend's room.   This guy lived there and is a tropical freak.  His room resembles a jungle (especially on three hits of acid).  So, I sat there and looked around.  Alone.", "This is when things started to go awry.  First of all, I now know it's a bad idea to trip alone unless you have something significantly distracting to do.  Secondly, this room was not user-friendly.  Oh yeah, this guy had three pet snakes, too.  Shit.  Everything in this bizarre room began to move and change color.  Simple things that normally remain simple began to take on severely different characteristics.  There were colorful, moving geometric designs in broad air.  One interesting point:  I remember thinking that, even", "though I was beginning to become frightened, the geometric designs you see on acid when you concentrate on something are very beautiful - they are indescribable and no artist could possibly reproduce them well enough to do them justice.  This is why I am not going to try to explain my hallucinations to you.  Other things are interesting, however, and easy enough to explain.  For example, this guy had a mural of fish, and when I looked at it, the fish were actually swimming around.  It didn't think this sort of thing was actually", "possible.  I had never really believed people when they had described things like this.", "Hallucinations can be fun.  The down side is that acid messes with your thinking process as well.  I tried to write down what I was feeling, but by the time I had written down three words, I had forgotten what I was trying to say.  It gives you a strange sense of paranoia as well.  You seem to think something bad is going to happen to you.  And you usually believe yourself.   But why not?  This is  an easy thing to do, when nothing you have seen in the past four hours has been real.", "After about eight to ten hours, I seemed to be peaking.  This really scared the shit out of me.  After awhile I was able to realize that it would all end in time, but minutes seemed like hours.  I wanted to sleep - my body was tired, but my mind was racing.  And, of course, I couldn't sleep, but this came as no surprise.  I remember trying however:  It was awful - the hallucinations I saw when I closed my eyes were worse than the ones I saw when my eyes were open.  I woke up one of my friends to talk with me, to keep me from going", "insane.  I couldn't look at him though - his face started to turn into awful things.  It would become all contorted, and his hair turned into tentacles which began moving toward me.", "Finally the drug wore off.  I still couldn't sleep though; I had that strange physical feeling where you're tired but you can't sleep, and you just accept it.  I was almost happy.  I remember thinking on the ride back to Madison - a voyage which was as metaphorical as it was literal; from utter craziness and a lack of reality back home to sanctuary and reality - that although my experience was very frightening, I still wouldn't call it a 'bad trip.'  I had experienced things that most straight people will never experience in three lifetimes.  I tried to tell people about it as I am trying to explain it here, but you really can't because it is an indescribable experience:  'I can't explain; you would not understand. This is not how I am.'  I don't know if I would have done it having known the consequences.   I don't know if I will do it again now knowing the consequences.  I probably will.", "Ok,this is something that affects me till this day. I was 19 years old at the time I had a very bad acid trip that seemed to posess supernatural powers,something very very evil I might add. this happened 8 years ago and I remember it like it was a few weeks ago..", "One day, after a morning of smoking rock-cocaine and taking addipex (what a nasty combination !), a friend calls me up and tell me that he had some really potent acid for sale.I was a big-time acid fiend and I was used to doing heavy-duty tripping. anyway, I told him to hold me 3 hits and I would be by later to pick it up. I didn't go over to get the acid until I was somewhat over the horrible feeling when you run out of coke or rock. I was still speeding (if you call addipex speed, i call it trash) from the addipex. I think I ate 2 addipexes that day. ok anyway that afternoon around 5 pm I got the acid and I remember how excited I was to take it because it had an elephant on the hit, it was more red than pink but it was referred to as pink elephant. the hits where still moist, saturated with LSD. I remember wondering if he might have licked my stuff, but I knew he wasn't a acid head. so I thought I would be a badass and take all three hits, even though he told me I wouldn't need more than one. well I took 3 hits under my tongue. they where still joined together as stamps, and I kept them under my tongue for a long time before grinding em up an dissolving it in my mouth. The acid came on slow at first. the first hour I felt the typical acid come on buzz. it wasn't until 3 hours after taking 3 hits of this stuff that things started to get really intense an almost scary. all I know is I ended up at a friend's ( a female) who lived close by my house( I was still doing the driving at this point). well while I was over there at her house we were on her screen porch and she has a couple birds that where in a cage...there was a picture on the wall of an angel and she appeared to be flying directly at me and I was commenting to the girl about it an laughig my ass off. things started to get really freaky,it was almost the 3 hour mark and I remember being so freaked out by the birds an the noises they made that I was ready to leave. I felt an overwhelming rush and my skin looked as though I had millions of intense patterns on it.", "before I left (this is what caused me also to leave)her mom came and said hello and I thought I was still talking to the girl I was visiting so there I was telling her mom that I was seeing the angel flying all over the room. the girl had to tell her mom I was tripping (her mom was 'cool'). anyway, i left and drove about 2 blocks to another friend's house and he wasn't doing anything that night( he also had stopped doing acid) so I asked him if he would drive for me because I was really starting to trip. he agreed to go with me so off we went to a bar. I said I wanted to go to play poll of all things to do tripping. well we get to this old biker bar and there was a big party going on and hundreds of people but we managed to get the only table there was!! ", "well that is when the acid started to tell me that this was not an ordinary trip..i started to hear noises, the bar started shaking,a little at first then it got violent..as it was shaking I could also hear bottles being hit together as if there was an earthquake an the bottles we hitting against each other. it still wasn't scared,i just felt really funny because not only was the bar an all shaking but it felt like the bottom half of my body was shaking. it felt so strange I asked my friend to leave with me an go outside. when we got outside it got worse so I asked him to drive me to a store to get a beer(even though we where at a bar)..so he drives me toward a store and it was like I could hear chanting. I asked him if he was saying stuff or chanting and he would tell me he wasn't but I really thought he was trying to make me trip harder by messing with me. On the way to the store I would look thru the passenger's side window and I got the fright of my life when I did. I seen the most evil looking demonic figure when I would look out the window.it scared me really bad. that was just the beginning of what happened. this thing was so scary to look at that when I would look at it an make eye contact with it it would actually make me go into convulsions. I lost all control of my body when this would make eye contact with me..then it got to where when I would try to look away it would follow..and if I waited to long to move away again it would catch up with me again and do the same thing.i also have to point out that this was not the only way I went into convulsions. either by eye contact or it would just jump into my stomach and I would also convulse. So I was really freaking out. ", "At this point we where supposed to be on our way to get a beer.( I was just trying to get off that bad trip that was comming on at the bar but I grew into something I will never ever forget) I made my friend turn around because of the demonic figures where about ti give me a heart attack I was so scared of this sight. on the way back home,right after he turned around..,i imagined that we had drove head on into an 18 wheeler and got killed..i could hear the screeching metal,then everything got quite a peaceful,but dark an evil quiet. I was terrified at this point. I actually thought we where dead,it was like I was outside of my body looking at us from a different perspective..i thought we where doomed to hell for sure !! This really was just the beginning of the bad trip. so now not only am I dealing with demonic figures,but now I have just visioned us being killed..the demons temporarily disappeared while I was hallucinating about the 18 an us getting in a fatal accident..but later the demons came back. right after the wreck I imagined I grabbed my friend and I had one hand around his shoulder hugging him as tight as I could,like a little scared kid or something..people I was terrified. the reason I grabbed my friend an hugged him is because I thought we had just been killed and I didn't want to loose him or let him go and I wanted him to tell me this wasn't real..when I grabbed him an hugged him he was driving,luckily we where on a back country road going very slow at my request. 5 mph seemed like 90 mph. anyway when I hugged my friend my other hand I was moving it an asking if he could see my hand move. I kept asking him if I was alive an if we had been killed. I asked him about the wreck an he was like what wreck..at this point I still think he is messing with me and I am begging him to please help me an not mess with me. He was actually so scared for me that he was crying!! He brought me to my house and stayed with me the whole night( this isn't the end!!).. okay so when we got home I thought that maybe if I got out an got fresh air I would be ok.. not a chance!! the demonic figures reappeared and this time more scary than before. this time I remember claws on this creature. I kept thinking I would be dragged away. This trip was so intense that there is so much that happened that I will not remember to include in this writting. ", "Well 3 months before this bad trip I was in treatment and my mom bought me this book on near death experiences and one of the stories in that book came into play on this bad acid trip. My life seemed to match someone who had a near death experience and I thought I had to die because the person in that book lived an that we could not both survive the same experience..well I couldn't take it outside my house so we went inside an I went into the bathroom while my friend tried to keep my parents from noticing me. he seemed to be gone forever as I was in the bathroom looking in the mirror (worst mistake). all I seen when I looked in the mirror was a horribly drug ravaged corpse,like it wa me but I was transparent, like some kind of spirit of evil decent,very evil. it scared me so bad that when my friend came into the bathroom I was shaking like a leaf and I asked my friend to feel my heart beating and it scared him so much he went tell my dad what I was on an about my heart. as all this was happening I thought I was either already dead from the 18 wheeler crash or I was going to die,that I was going to be pulled away by this being. well the acid by this time was almost at peak level. well my dad comes in an feels my heart rate and decided to call 911,i was in the living room trying to avoid the demonic figures who kept appearing,still jumping into my stomach and giving me the eye..i also seen the same thing I seen in the mirror,the horrible ghost like double of me. this also made me convulse. I never had anything like that happened to me and I used to do so much shrooms an acid. what I still think is it all built up because after that I always had a bad trip for a few years after. ", "Well the ambulance finally got there and I remember right b4 the ambulance got there the police got there too. they where asking me where I got the acid but the cops where the last thing on my mind.. ok one of the first cops that waled in looked like this friend of mine's dad who was a small time cop in a small town.. the cop looked exactly like that man and I thought I was dead at this point and that cop's spirit was there or something,like I was in some very scary afterlife. when the ambulance showed up they put me in the stretcher and in the back of the ambulance (when I got to the hospital I swore I flew in a helicopter). the ambulance drive I remember part of that,, they would try to make me repeat stuff to see how my brain was reacting. I was also talking to god begging him to let me live an I was praying I wasn't already dead but I was convinced I was. I guess they wanted me to pee or something but I thought they where draining all the fluids out of my body because I was dead. the iv's made me think the same thing.. that they where preparing me to embalm..later at the hospital I could hear them talking about funeral arrangements and everyone I seen looked like family members who had flew in from all over the us to see me one last time. I could smell the embalming fluid and I foreseen my funeral and I imagined how everyone would react. while I was recovering(even though I didn't know I was yet)i would see people who had been dead,they would walk in an this would further confirm I must be dead.", "It was not until the doc asked me if I wanted to see my mom that I started to get my head.. then my mom came in( I still thought I wad dead)and she was rubbing my forehead an saying to me now you see what drugs can do.. I though she was saying that to her son's corpse. at that time I said 'moma can you hear me?' and then she said yes..that was the most beautiful yes I ever hear because at that moment reality started to come back to me. the whole time before all the doctors an nurses seemed to not be talking or communicating with me.it was not till I asked my mom is she could hear me that I realized I was indeed still here on earth an not awaiting hell an a funeral. listen people I have left out things I would have definitely wanted to include.. this trip was so intense, so detailed,so supernatural that to this day I think that something very supernatural occurred. I was very lucky not to die..the doc said the lad wouldn't have killed me but I could have died of fright.", "Well after this experience I still kinda thought I might really be dead and for about a year I wouldn't go into any cemetary because I was terrified I would fine my own grave an that is when I thought I would have to finish with the death part of the trip. this permanently damaged my brain people. I couldn't accept what had happened to me so I decided to do acid again about 3 months after this bad trip and do you know what kinda acid I done?? Pink elephant !!! and I done a half a hit more than what put me in the hospital and although I tripped killer I didn't have that bad trip BUT after that I started to have bad trips again, nothing like the pink elephant experience.. however I had a mushroom bad trip a couple years later and it was almost as bad.", "Well I hope everyone uses Lsd with more caution than I did.. don't mix drugs, especially coke speed an acid. peace an love to everyone and remember if you find yourself on a bad trip just remember you aren't going to die and that many others have been thru more intense trips than you have. there will always be someone who does more than the next person..just be careful.", "It all started the day my friend Shauna and I decided that we were going to go to a college fraternity party and that we wanted to be under the influence of some mind altering substance, instead of drinking like we normally did at parties.  And we wanted something stronger than just marijuana.  So, we talked to a friend and he said he could either get us Ectasy or LSD.  We told him either one would be fine.   I had done both before, and never had a bad experience.  Shauna had never done either, but wanted to be with me the first time she did.  Finally, he called and said that he had gotten us some acid.  So, we went and got it about 6pm.  The party started at 11, so we figured we would take it around 10.  The kid we bought it from told us not to take more than one at a time because they were really potent.  He called them Purple Monster.  They were tiny, with a purple background and a cartoon-like monster pattern on them.  So, we went back, stopped for some orange juice along the way and sat around till 10.  At 10pm, we took the first tab, then we got ready for the party.  We didn't feel anything yet when we arrived at the party.  Shauna kept asking me if she was supposed to be feeling it yet, and I said that it was odd that it hadn't kicked in yet.  By midnight, we were just feeling a little like we had smoked pot.  So, we left the party and walked back to our dorm with 2 guys we know that live a floor above us in the dorm. (Neither of them were on anything, they were just drunk.) As we were walking back (it's about a 10 min walk), it hit me that I was feeling it.  I looked back behind me to see if Shauna was feeling anything and the scenery blurred as I turned my head.  Everything seemed to be in slow motion.  Then, I knew that we were tripping.  I told Shauna to 'think happy thoughts,' as we had discussed what a bad trip was before we took it.  She asked a lot of questions before we took it, and understood what was going to happen...somewhat.  ", "So, we got back to the dorm, stood outside and smoked a cigarette.  Then Shuana and I started talking to each other.  We stood directly in front of one another and just focused on each other's eyes, and everything and everyone around us just disappeared.  Shauna kept telling me that one of the guy's mom's was coming to visit and that she was mad at us.  I was trying to talk her out of it as I began to believe it myself.  So, we went inside and up to the guy's room.  I sat down on one bed on the one side of the room and Shauna laid down on the other bed  across the room and I discovered that inside the mirror across the room it was snowing.  Shauna didn't believe me, and her face twisted and contorted until it was this evil, demonic face and her voice changed into a deep, growling voice as she told me that she didn't believe me and that I was lying to her.  One of the guys sat down on the edge of the bed and she put her one arm up over his shoulder, so all I could see was him grasping her hand hanging over his shoulder.  I thought that he had hurt her, so I started crying and telling her to take her hand off of him.  She just glared at me with this demonic look on her face and said 'No, Ann...he's not going to hurt me.'  Time went on after this and we just sat in the room and tripped and the guys messed with our heads.  Nothing unusual....yet.  Then we decided that we wanted to smoke some weed.  And we both took another hit of acid at that point.  So, I got my bowl, Shauna had one of the guys roll her a joint with some of her weed, and we went outside to smoke.  Shauna went off with the guy that rolled her the joint to smoke it, and I stood on the front porch of my dorm and smoked about 3 bowls between 2 of us.  It was about 2am at that point.  Shauna came around the corner of the building sobbing hysterically, repeating my name over and over again.  She couldn't handle being away from me on her trip.  She went nuts if I wasn't in the same area or room as her the whole time.", "We went back inside, and after a while the guys passed out, so we had to go downstairs to my room.  So, we went to the end of the hall and down to the landing of the next floor down, where I live.  We couldn't decide whether it was my floor or not, and we stood there for what seemed like an hour trying to decide if we should go down the stairs (which looked like they led to nowhere) or go down the hall.  Finally, I convinced Shauna that we should go down the hall to my room.  My roommate was home for the weekend, so the room was empty.  We went in, and got dressed for bed.  Shauna laid down in my roommate's bed and I laid down in mine.  She started saying how bad her back was hurting her, and then my neck started to hurt really bad.  This is another effect of acid.  Then she looked at me and said, 'let's have a cigarette.' Since I have a smoking room, this was not a big deal.  So, we each got a cigarette out and sat there holding them, thinking they were lit, since we could see smoke coming out of the ends of them.  I said we better go over by the window so it doesn't smell like smoke too bad in here.  So, when Shauna went to get off of the bed, she realized that the floor had morphed into water, and if we touched it, that we would drown. So, we had to get over to the window without touching the floor.  We sat and devised a plan to jump from the beds to the chairs by the window so that we could smoke over there.  We finally made it.  Then when we realized that our cigarettes weren't really burning, we lit them and smoked them.  Then we went back to the beds and sat and talked about our visuals.  I saw this huge cement drainage tube that was open and at the top was a big tilted bottle of Heinz ketchup that was pouring into the drain pipe.  I told Shauna about it, and she said that she was trying to get to the other end of the tunnel to get to me.  The pipe then transformed into a tunnel.  I told Shauna to walk towards me, and as she did, Santa Claus appeared in front of me and wouldn't let Shauna walk past me.  So, I was hollering to her that she couldn't get by because Santa Claus was in the way.  Then that visual disappeared and we both shut our eyes.  All of the geometric shapes were green and red, Christmas colors.  And we saw the same exact things at the same time.  Then we discovered that if we looked up really fast with our eyes open, we could see these crackling, silver sparkles that flooded across the room.  All of a sudden as we were talking, I transformed into someone else.  Shauna started talking to me as if I was someone else.  I asked her who she was talking to and she said that there was a man with a red beard lying in my bed.  And that one side of his face was male and one side was female.  She asked him where Ann was, and he/I said that she had gone outside to smoke.  Shauna then got very upset that I had gone outside without her, and that this man was sitting in my bed.", "Then she looked at the door and said, 'Oh, Ann is back.'  Then, I instantly transformed back into myself.  Then, we were sitting talking and every couple of minutes, Shauna would glance at the door and say, 'Ann, the door is open,' and I would look and it was closed.  I would tell her that it was closed and she would say that everytime I looked, it would close really fast then it would open again.  That started to freak me out.   So I was paranoid that someone kept opening the door.  Finally, after a while, we started to come down.  Many times, we would think that we were done tripping, and that feeling would come back.  Finally, we both fell asleep, exhausted mentally and physically.  All in all, we tripped for 10 hours.  The next couple of days, neither of us felt normal.  I have had a couple of flashbacks.  Even now as I am writing this, I can visualize each experience with great clarity.  Shauna's first trip was a great one.  And Santa Claus was an underlying theme of the whole trip.", "The second time I tripped, it was with my friend, and boyfriend at the time; we'll call him J. It was way more intense than the first time, but I felt worse after I came down. We got the acid from another friend and took it at her house at about 8pm. J and I were with a third friend, W, who wasn't on anything that night. We were driving out to J's house and we picked up some fast food on the way and ate in an empty parking lot near J's house. While they were eating I started feeling the acid. I felt tingly all over, and then it felt like when your foot falls asleep, but all over my body. J and W walked around the parking lot smoking a cigarette and I stayed in the car because I was cold. I was looking at the car seat and it looked like it was breathing, very gently. ", "Then we went to J's house, and talked to his parents and grandmother for a while. I was really feeling it by then. I felt detached and kind of unfocused or tranced out. We went outside and we were leaning against the above-ground pool. Water looks really awesome when you're tripping. I was leaning against J and we were entranced by the stars. The clouds appeared to be coming in closer and closer. J was trying to explain it to W and we waved his lit cigarette across the sky. J and I both saw it leave a bright trail and we were like, 'Whoa!!!' W just said, 'Okaaaay...' (He's been with me both times I tripped; he finds it hilarious to watch people on acid.) We went inside and were watching Outbreak  on one of the fifty billion movie channels. The sick people looked really disgusting. ", "Then we went outside; it was December so it was pretty cold. J and I smoked a joint and we were just having fun being fucked-up dorks. W was having fun watching us be fucked-up dorks. Me and J spent a lot of time looking at the sky; we both saw a cloud that looked like a man's face moving around. At one point I was holding the joint and the wind blew smoke into my eyes. Everything look beautiful and swirly for a second. It was just a screen of white opalescent smoke. J, who doesn't exactly live in the best part of town (he calls it the ghetto but it's not too bad) was telling us about all the neighbors that went past. Then we saw a dog across the street. J went over and started barking at it. It barked back once, J barked back louder and ran toward it, and the dog hauled ass down the street. It was really funny. We went back inside, and by then I felt like I was just drifting through everything we did. ", "All of a sudden, all my thoughts, everything just made perfect sense. Everything seemed so right, and I was thinking that this was how it should always be. J was holding his baby niece for what seemed like a long time, but my sense of time was way distorted, anyway he and the baby just looked so content and peaceful. That added to my thoughts of how right everything was. W and I had to leave soon after that (we're still in high school, we had a lame curfew). On the way home, my sense of time got even more out of whack. The clock would say, like, 11:30 or something, for what felt like ten minutes. Then I'd look back what I thought was 2 minutes later and it'd be 20 minutes later. Before the tripping started, J and I told W to let us listen to 'It's On' by Korn when we started tripping. So me and W listened to it on the way home. It was awesome. If you've never heard it, it had kind of weird, fluctuating noises at the beginning. ", "I was at my dad's house for the weekend, and of course I didn't want him to know I was tripping, so I was trying to avoid him as much as possible. I wanted to go to bed because I hadn't peaked yet and I was afraid I'd act too weird in front of him. There was a towel on a rack in the bathroom that look like it was contacting in and out like an accordion. My dad asked where all we'd gone, and for a second I completely blanked out until I remembered we were at J's. I told him i was tired  so I as going to bed, but he was in a talkative mood. I was beginning to have visual hallucinations so I finally locked myself in my room for the night. The walls were moving. My dork little sister had hung pine tree garland things all over in honor of Christmas, and I swore they were breathing. There were also foil garlands that looked like liquid that was dancing. It was cool. ", "Then I noticed the ceiling. It's wood so you could see the grain and where the paint is peeling, and the patterns it formed were moving all over, like a flat lava lamp. I watched the ceiling most of the night. At one point the design changed to bugs and scorpions but I didn't freak like I thought I would have. The bed was the softest I've ever been in. I was floating. My deep thoughts returned; over anf over in my head was a mantra of 'Everything is now.' I was thinking that we spend way too much time obsessing over the past and future, and we should just chill and ejoy everything now. I finally got to sleep for an hour at 7am. It was a better trip than my first, because I didn't see things that much the first time. But next time, I'll probably do it during the day. ", "This was the day before semester exams and I need sleep! Since then I've kind of kept in mind the 'revelations' I had; I quit worrying so much about what I could have changed of the past and I don't freak about the future, I just kind of go with the flow. Which isn't a bad idea, I found. See, drugs are good for some things!", "I had recently bought four hits of LSD blotter when I was informed by someone who had done this particular batch before that it was really weak stuff, and you'd have to eat a lot to get really high.  I didn't pay too much for the blotter, so I really didn't care.  I decided that I'd trust what the girl had said, and I'd take all 4 blotters at once.", "Well Friday rolled around, and I had just spent some time goofing around with some friends and I was feeling pretty good.  I was planning on doing the stuff Saturday but I was pretty happy now, and I had nothing important to do later, so I decided to do it then.", "I dropped the stuff at about 6PM, I held it under my tongue for a few minutes then I swallowed it.  It left a strange 'fresh' feeling in my mouth.  I didn't really start to feel anything until about 7PM.  It started with a feeling that things were somehow different, and I started to feel slight sensations of joy running through my body. Soon after that things started to take on a dream like state.  I don't know how you dream, but it was like dreams that I have.  They're in color and everything sounds and looks a little bit hazy and '60's color t.v-ish'.  I felt like I was somehow external of my own self.  It was like I was inside myself but I was experiencing things in third person.  A strange but interesting feeling indeed.", "I was riding in a car for part of the time when I was high, and this was great.  Whenever the car turned or bumped I would go into a pleasurable feeling that would encapsulate part of my body.  It was kinda like the body feelings I get when I take LSA (Morning Glory extract) except to a much lesser extent.", "These effects started to die down at about 10PM, but I still had an off baseline feeling for the rest of the night.  I tried to go to sleep around 11PM, but found it very hard.  I eventually drifted off into sleep, but it was very restless.  I woke up around 5 or 6 times that night. I finally went into a deep peaceful sleep at around 3AM.", "I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed and alive, as I usually do after taking a hallucinogen.  Given this was my first time with LSD it was a good experience, but it didn't have all the funky visuals and feelings I expected it to, so I was somewhat disappointed.  I attribute this to the weakness of the blotter.  I would repeat this again, but with better quality LSD.", "I have taken LSD many times. There are only a precious few trips that really stick out in my mind as an EXPIERIENCE, this is a letter about one of them. I was with my best friend/trip buddy Meg, and we decided to go to a party and take some acid. My other friend Nikki and her date (a guy i never met before) decided to come to the party with us, and trip also. This was fine because i love Nikki and this guy she was with was cool and had a positive attitude. On the flipside, the party we were going to was going to be intense. A lot of my ex-girlfriends were going to be there along with people i didnt like and a lot of strangers. The party was at a 2 floor apt. in a bad city. During recent acid trips my best friend Meg and I had we became bonded with this ceramic garden Gnome that i had in my room. For reasons i cant explain he was our tripping buddy and we named him BILL THE TRIP GNOME. He has a wise smile on his bearded face and seems to have brought us peace and comfort during our recent acid trips. We knew it was gonna be a crazy nite, so we all decided to bring Bill the Gnome to the party with us. I put him in my backpack along with other things to prepare me for the nite. I alwasy have certain things with me if im doing acid away from home, the things i brought that nite besides Bill the Gnome were, some beer because i like to drink a little when i trip. I also brought a change of clothes in case i did something stupid and got dirty or sweaty. I also had my glow toys which included a squishy glow ball(red) and green glow sticks. I also have asprin just in case of a headache. So I was prepared physically and mentally for a good trip... ", "Knowing Bill would be there gave me a really good vibe for the nite. We dropped in the car on the way to the party at about 9pm. The blotters were named MAGIC, which i liked because i wanted it to be a magical evening. It kicked it quick for us, we all took 2 and 1/2 hits at the same time. Meg gave everyone vitamin C drops to help out our colors and visuals. I never really thought it did much but this nite it all seemed to flow so well. We get to the party, and there are so many people there, at this time the acid is starting to take effect and when we walk in we stayed in our little trip group and found a spot in the house where we could have our 'comfort zone'. We all decided to just sit for a bit and take in our surroundings before anything else. We were on the floor in a 4 person circle when i opened my bag and took out Bill. Everyone else at the party was drunk and smoking pot, we were the only ones on LSD. When i took Bill out and placed him in the center of our circle we all smiled and giggled because Bill started to smile with us, and gave us strength that the nite would go smoothly. This little 10inch ceramic Gnome became the center of our 'comfort zone' and many of the drunks were already making fun of us, but we all looked at eachother and nobody cared because Bill was giving us courage and strength. He knew us and they did not. ", "About 30 min. after we got to the party the acid started to kick us full on. It was about 1 hour into the trip. Everyone was standing and smoking and we were all still sitting. As we looked up the smoke at the top of the room looked amazing. I asked Nikkis date if he was ok, because he really only knew Nikki. He just smiled and laughed and said 'im lost!'. I knew he would be ok and i let him take in his own trip. My gay guy friend Al came over to us to talk and just laughed when he saw Bill. Al had a shirt on it with a wonderful abstract pattern and we all noticed it at the same time. He found it amusing that we were so fasinated with his shirt. He had never done acid and asked us what was so special about his shirt. I told him that ' it looks like your wearing liquid clothing, its not a shirt its liquid armor!'. For the next hour we just sat in our circle and watched everyone. People didnt really talk to us, and it felt like we were flys on the wall just watching and waiting. About 2 hours into the trip we decided to take a walk upstairs. We left our circle and Bill to hold the fort(even though he was an inatimate object) we knew he would keep our comfort zone safe. ", "Going upstairs was like going to another world, and we all agreed on this. Things were so different upstairs because the whole scene had changed. Different people, and different music. It wasnt bad, but it wasnt as good as being downstairs. All four of us sat on a bed huddled toghether and just started to crack up for no reason. The laughing fit seemed to last forever until the girl who lived there gave us a HUGE sticker book with all kinds of sticker like fuzzy ones, glitter, squishy, big, small, and very colorful. The stickers are just what we needed at that point in the trip. They were amazing and the color was just popping out of the pages of the book. Every kind of image was in that book on a sticker. I started to worry about my Gnome,Bill. So Meg and i took the journey down the stairs into the place we started our trip. It seemed like we were only upstairs for like half an hour but it was actually close to an hour and a half. So we were reaching the end of our peak and we all knew it. ", "I told Nikki and her date that they had to come and bond with Bill the trip Gnome. We went to our comfort zone which was untouched thanks to Bill. He had a little satisfied smile on his face, and just looked at us with his blue eyes. We all agreed he was special, and magical. We were all glad I decided to bring him to the party. Most of the people had left, and the others that were still there gave us a nice vibe and we were all very comfortable. I drank some beer and took some asprin and just relaxed the rest of the nite. I said my goodbyes and went home with my friends. That nite or should I say early morning, cause it was like 4am when i got home, well I sat Bill down on the table next to my bed and just stared at him until I fell asleep. He seemed to sooth my brain and sing me to sleep. ", "That was one of the best trips ive ever had, and i really owe it all to a ceramic garden gnome. I know it sounds crazy, but he was a good friend and although i dont have him anymore, i do miss having him with me. 'BILL THE TRIP GNOME' I will always love that guy. I wish all of you acid lovers could meet him. I do think LSD is a great drug, and a wonderful way to find yourself. That nite i learned that you can love anything. Even if his reality only exists in my own head.", "This experience happened in the early autumn of 1975.  I had had a bad trip on LSD (4 hits) some months earlier (May).  My brother had some friends over to the house, all of whom had just dropped two hits of acid each.  One of these guys had never done acid before.  And there he was, dropping two hits of purple microdot for his first taste.  Oh well.  ", "We all were sitting in the living room, on the floor, lounging in couches or recliners, whatever.  One or two folks were beginning to notice some effects, trails and such.  No one getting giggly yet.  Suddenly, the first timer leaps to his feet from where he was sitting against a wall and announces, 'My God!  I'm having a bad trip!'  All eyes in the room focused on ME.  After all, I was the only one here who had not dropped any acid at the time.  I was also the only one who had ever experienced a bad trip before.  I suppose they all looked at me as some kind of authority.   Well, this was no time to disabuse them of such notions.  I remained slumped in the recliner and smiled beatifically at the first timer.  'You're not having a bad trip, man.'  'I'm not?', he replied in bewilderment.  'No, you're having a great trip.  Just sit down, relax and enjoy it.'  God had spoken, or so it may have seemed to this confused first time psychonaut.  'Okay,' he responded, sat down and pasted a big smile on his face.", "The rest of the trip was just fine for all my friends.  They did not remain at the house, but took off for parts unknown about an hour after this incident.  They told me about the experience later.  The key point here is that the first timer, who thought he was having a bad trip, enjoyed himself.  It could have gone otherwise.  If I, or anyone else, had responded to his panicked assertion with sympathy or with concern, we could have fed his belief and reinforced it disastrously.", "I am sure most of those reading these reports do not need to be told this.  It is for those who have only limited experience with psychedelics who may have fortuitously stumbled on these vaults.  Take heed.  Always keep a positive outlook, especially if you are functioning as a guide to someone who is new to the psychedelic experience.", "Last night was new year's eve, and now it is 2001. I had recently purchased two hits of the yellow/orange sun design of paper acid.", "The evening commenced at a pool party outside in a heated pool, with a bubble tent thing over it all. About 15 people were there but I was most interested in one. A girl I've known for awhile, but for unclear reasons we never seem to hook up. Anyways, the night was going well, it was already awesome just to be with her, especially on such a night as new year's eve. ", "Halfway through this her ex-boyfriend showed up and almost ruined everything. I debated on whether or not to take the acid, but everything turned out awesome. After midnight I went over to another party so that I could ingest the dose in semi-peace, that way she didn't know what I was doing. I dropped it and smoked a joint and a bowl and headed back to her friend's house where she was staying. About 5 people were there, but they were half asleep. ", "I started to feel it a little before I went over there. I think they knew what was going on, or at least that I was on something. They probably just thought I was high. Anyways, the gitteryness had already passed at the other person's house...I mean, it was still there but I was into the other things, just feeling enhancment. What we did that night I don't know, but it was like our minds and souls were melded together. Time didn't exist...I kept drifting off into this weird dream world. But at the same time I was still wired and awake with her, cuddling and doing whatnot. We didn't have sex, or any other alternatives to sex, but the whole experience was better than sex can ever be normally. It was heaven...what I felt couldn't be described. This was my first acid trip, it is too hard to explain.", "After I left there at 4 am (dropped the acid at 12:30), I was peaking I think. Walls looked like they were just kind of rippling slowly, breathing, doorcracks would breathe. I left and went back to my buddy's house. My other friend had tripped too that night, but I didn't see him. At his house I lit up and saw tracers galore. It was amazing...the whole experience. I didn't get to sleep 'til 8 this morning and that was after I smoked 4 more bowls by myself.", "Back in 1984 I was stationed at For the last four years I had been a good little airman and gave up pot, LSD, mescaline, and other fun stuff of my youth and also like a good little airman I took to the bottle with a vengeance. Working with me was a really cool dude named Jim. Jim and I instantly connected and every friday night we put our families on hold, bought some Wild Irish Rose and Vivarin and played guitar and talked religion and philosophy 'til the wee hours. Eventually talk turned to the spiritual aspect of the LSD experience and it wasn't long before we were planning a little trip. I figured that if we dropped on friday night we'd have plenty of time to recover before monday rolled around, so it was set; the next friday we would both trip one last time and see what we get out of it. ", "Well, things didn't quite go as planned. After my Biology class was over I headed over to Jim's house full of anticipation. But when I got there, Jim wasn't alone; he had Joe there with him! Bad enough anyone else was involved, Joe was the epitome of uptight and white. 'Hey Jim,' I said, 'why is Joe here?'. Jim said 'Check out his eyes!' and sure enough, Joe's' pupils were dripping all over the floor. Turns out Jim had mentioned it to a few people and we had some deliveries to make. 'THIS IS NOT GOOD!' I thought, but the ball was rolling... so we dropped it off to some other guys in the shop (people who reported to me as I was the swingshift shop chief at the time!) and headed back to Jim's to await the effects. ", "About an hour went by and I wasn't feeling anything. Jim and Joe were zoomin' so I chilled out and let those two jam on guitars for a while while I relaxed. Then there was a knock on the door. 'I'll get it,' I said. I went to the door and looked out the little window in it, and as I was opening the door for this guy standing outside, I thought, ' Why is someone crouching behind the bushes back there, and why is someone over by the wall...'", "FREEZE! YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR USEPOSSESIONANDDISTRIBUTION OF LSD! Yes, it was all one word, and I felt like I was suddenly shoved underwater. Everything was so unreal, time was in slow? fast? motion, and all I thought was, 'Thank God it didn't kick in!'. Jim and Joe had a different experience, I imagine. The room was full of Security Police with M-16's pointed at our heads (even though I was cuffed behind my back) and they ransacked the place. Turns out Jim's wife blabbed to a busybody neighbor who called the First Sargeant who called the Squadron Commander who called the Office of Special Investigation and in the retelling of the story it was thought that we were bringing 6000 hits on base, possibly to taint the water supply! So we go to the base hospital for a piss test and then they let us walk back home.", "NOW it kicks in! Trees start looming at me, lights are streaky and I'm feeling very giddy.Even though I'm tripping, my mind is very clear, and I can see how I've just screwed up things in a major way for me, my wife and 2 year old daughter. I related the tale to my wife and told her I had to lay down for a while and work things out. I curled up in a fetal position on the bed and closed my eyes. I could see this huge octagonal carpet suspended in the blackest darkness. The colors blended from one corner to the next, and I knew that each of the eight corners was emotion; the burgandy corner was guilt, the maroon was shame, the dark purple was frustration, and so on. Slowly, one of the corners started to droop down, and as it did I could feel the associated emotion welling up inside me. Suddenly the corner plunged into the void and I was wracked with overwhelming guilt, so much so that I would violently shake and moan on the bed. ", "My wife came in when she heard this, and I pulled myself out of it long enough to tell her, 'It's alright, I've got to go through this now.'. She left the room and I returned to the floating carpet. After 45 minutes (an eternity, in my time) I came out to the living room, exhausted and drenched with sweat. The morning sun was about to come up, and I relaxed into a chair, put on a tape, and to the opening strains of America's 'Horse with no name' the sun slipped over the horizon and shot directly, but gently, into my eye. ", "Oh man...I can feel it now... it's so beautiful... God is silently, insistently saying everything's alright... I can't describe how much light and love was in me then... and now...", "Sorry, I'm back. the next few minutes are so bizarre. Suddenly there was no more music even though it was still playing, somewhere, out there... all I could think of was how much I loved my daughter and at that instant my daughter came straight out of her room and climbed into my lap. She stared long and deep into my eyes and said, 'Daddy, you have rainbows in your eyes' and I realized that I was not made of flesh anymore, I was a giant, glowing, sunshine-filled diamond, and fear fell away. Pain fell away. And I was filled with the power of the Universe. Even weeks later I could feel it. I had the power to look inside people and see their fears and weaknesses and I knew they were totally powerless against me. Of course, all the power I had was light and love and all I wanted to do to people was to love and heal them and bring them into the light. It was truly magical. ", "The Air Force wasn't done with me yet, though. I went to jail for a few months, got busted from Staff Sargeant to Airman, money was taken from me, they made up some shit to get me in hot water with the IRS and are still making me repay some money they said thay gave me, but all in all, it was worth it. For a very short time, I WAS 'THERE' and I'd do it all over again.", "I have had a total of 3 LSD experiences in my life. I have mixed feelings about this synthetic psychedelic. ", "My first trip was enjoyable at first and then became irritating. I ate one blotter on a sunny saturday morning in December. I pretty much stayed in my room for the duration of the trip. I felt little paranoia even though I was tripping alone in my parents home while my mom was there. The peak was great, which is really the only part of the trip I enjoyed. I'll describe the 'peak' of the trip as follows: ", "The visual hallucinations were moderate and interesting. Pretty much just the characteristic 'breathing' of inanimate objects. I saw random patterns that were usually pink in color. Music sounded amazing. I was very fascinated with my existence at that point in time. Time had little significance. My thoughts were extremely deep and meta-physical. I was definitely euphoric, elated. I smiled continuously, almost uncontrollably. ", "The body high was intense, somewhat annoying and felt very synthetic. basically a tingly feeling in my nerves. It became irritating. At one point my thoughts were so random, fast and uncontrollable that I felt I had reached insanity. (not good, as this can lead to a bad trip) I had bad 'Gut Rot' as users call it. It felt like a stomach ache that would accompany an alcohol hangover, only more intense and more painful. I felt really dirty. I was sweating and I wasn't hot, kind of strange. My back hurt. I experienced lassitude, my body felt useless. (this was more noticable when the peak wore down, as when I was peaking I was too high to notice it) ", "After the intensity of the peak wore off, I started to gradually come down and the trip just became long and irritating as the negative side-effects became more noticable. I was sick of it and I just wanted it to end. It took about 12 hours after I dropped the hit until I was completely sober. I only really enjoyed the first 3 hours of the trip.", "my second hit of acid didn't even cause me to 'trip'. I only felt a mild body high and all the uncomfortable side-effects. not cool. maybe I didn't take enough, but I'm a lightweight so I figured it wouldn't make a difference. This really turned me off to it. ", "My third trip was very similar to the first, with an exception to the visuals. This time I saw more trails, unlike my first trip. The rest of the visuals were more subtle. Later I found out this was because the LSD was clean and properly made and stored.", "Overall I thought LSD felt like a very cheap and synthetic high. unlike psilocybin mushrooms, which feel completely pure and natural.", "I really do not like the side-effects associated with acid and I may never take it again. Ever since I experimented with Psilocybin, I have had little desire in taking LSD again. Mushrooms produced a very comfortable, controllable, non-irritating trip in contrast to acid.", "I had been wanting to take acid for a LONG time and I finally got my chance. It was sort of a last minute thing....", "One of my friends got a hold of 2 hits of acid and he sold them to me. I went to work with my two hits at about 3... and at 7 I ate one of them not expecting to take the other one. I felt a bit light headed right after i took it... not sure if it was because i was nervous about the idea of it being my first time, or if it was from the actual drug. Well i got out of work at 9 and i still wasnt tripping, so i called my friend 'E' and i went back to her house. ", "At about 10:30 i took the second hit, figuring i might not even trip at all. Around that time i had been starting to see the walls sort of breath in and out, not very STRONG.... not enough to say i was really 'tripping'. We went into the kitchen and ate some food. I started staring at the table, and it started to sort of wave. The more i stared at it, the more it would wave. It made the same type of motions as the ocean would. I looked down at my hand... and the tips of my fingers kind of waved out like each of them were made of candle wax... bending up and down like they were slowly melting into long streams of color. I was facinated with it... i must have been staring at my fingers for a good ten minutes. Then we got up and walked into her room. Suddenly the walls and the floor and the celling looked like the table did, except waving much more. This time the waves pushed in deeper, and pushed up higher. ", "It was about maybe... 1 AM. I layed down with a blanket. Each wrinkle of the blanket rippled out like water. It was crazy. We lit a candle, and it kept pulsing in and out, as if it was actually breathing. Everything looked so real. I left to go to the bathroom. I got in there, and stared at the counter where the sink was. It slowly just sank from the middle all the way to the floor. With a blink of an eye it went back to normal. I flushed the bathroom toliet and freaked out. The sound was so loud it scared the fuck out of me. For some reason i kept having to go to the bathroom after that. I made E go with me and stand out side the door. When i was finished i'd open the door, and then flush the toilet. It sounds funny right now as i read that over, but really it was a scary thing. For a few hours we were up just talking about everyday shit. We started talking about reality bullshit. From there i came up with an interesting theory about reality. I decided... there was no such thing as reality... but only the one you are given.", "'What if the you're seeing isnt the same blue that i'm seeing? Blue is a cold color. We both know that. What is a cold color? How do you describe it exactly? Words dont mean anything, they're all made up. You cant really describe what you are seeing to me with words, because they arent descriptive compared to what we see. Everyone who uses communication based on words is ignorant. You cant tell what something IS using words because everybody interpets them differently.' ", "That thought depressed me for a little bit, but i eventually got over it. I tried to figure out a different way to communicate without using words. I thought it would be a great way to express communicate. I did think of some different ways... but now that i think of them they didnt really make sense at all. E got a little bored of the topics i was talking about. Of course, i knew... eventually E got tired and wanted to sleep. She blew out the candle and i freaked out. ", "That was the point where it started getting bad. I felt so alone. All she wanted to do was go to bed, and for some reason i didnt understand why she would want to do that to me. I kept thinking she wanted to ignore me and just go to bed. I sat there in the dark crying for about a half hour. Her wall is covered in prints of paintings. I looked at a portrait of some guy and it felt like he was just staring at me. His eyes kept blinking real fast. The other picture i looked at was a picture of the ocean with clouds above and thunder bolts coming from them. As i stared at it, the coulds started to move and the rain drops sprinkled down on the ocean. It was crazy, but i was afraid of it. The water motions were still very intense. I just wanted them to stop. I looked into a full legnth mirrior of myself. All of the features on my face kind of melted together. The mirrior would wave back and forth. I admit that was pretty fucking cool, but still... scared the shit outa me. I layed down and tried to fall asleep, but whenever i opened my eyes the trees outside the window looked like big giant black ants. Not really ants, but... creatures... i can best describe them looking like ants. The would blink at me, and just stare at me. That was probably the most terrifying thing that i could think of. I smoked a cigarette. The cigarette looked like it was melting into my head... kind of forming over my two fingers. It reminded me of when you tear an airhead candy apart and it sorta draaagggsss down to your fingers. Thats how the cigarette looked. Evetually i was out of cigarettes, E was still asleep, and i got a little bored of the hallucinations. I tried to sleep. It was hard. I closed my eyes and i saw these red lights springing around my eyelid. They looked much like the hallucinations you would recieve from robotripping (DXM). At some point though, i did fall asleep. ", "I woke up at about 10 am. I saw the hallucinations that i saw in the very beginning of my trip... the mellow breathing in-and-out on the walls, floor, and celling. I was mentally okay, but i felt as if the night before never took place. I felt like i dreamt it all. It wasnt an exactly bad feeling... it just made me feel really weird. I went to work at 12. I smoked a butt on my cigarette break and the hallucinations came back... full blast. I was afraid they would last a while... but they only lasted about 2 or three minutes. ", "It may sound really corny, but ever since ive tripped... that one stupid time... i have felt different about lots of things. Things that mattered to me before dont matter anymore. I look at life differently. I feel its a positive outlook, maybe it isnt... but i like what it has done to me.", "Over all i'm glad i had the chance to trip... and i would most definatly do it again. If i had to do it over again, i wouldnt do it at night. Tripping at night can be fun as long as the person you are with doesnt fall asleep on you.", "15 out of 35 of us that went on a haunted hayride ate the wicked liquid.  15 of us have not been the same since.  We all expected a body buzzzz and some visuals, but none of us expected what happened next.  That night new doors of perception opened in our minds.  I have always been the type of person who does their drugs, that night the drugs did me.  I almost lost it.  I have never blacked out from lsd before, and that night there are hours i dont remember.  Everyone who ate it tripped for over 24 hours.  I my case it was 48.  I fell asleep and when i woke up i was still tripping. ", "I watched some of my friends freak out.  Others would try to talk them down but we all found that we could not find the words to exprese the thoughts in our heads.  My body was twitching my eyelids were fluttering.  It was ruthless.  I never thought i was going to come down.  My friend S almost drowned in the shower.  When i took one i knew that water was hitting my body but it didnt feel like i was getting wet.  We all call it the wicked liquid, for this reason...what is in such a minute drop of liquid that can freak out 15 adults?  For all of you reading this I dont know what strain of liquid it was so if asked if you want some liquid lsd, think twice.  Liquid USED to be my favorite type of LSD.  NEVER again.", "not long ago i was handed a couple of sugar cubes of dubious strength.  they were a little old, so anything could happen, really.  or nothing.  i like a good experiment, so my psychadelic partner and i gave it a shot.  and there wasn't much there, really.  so we smoked a good amount of pot and tried to get over the disappointment. and that's when it became a good experience.", "i've been taking psychedelic drugs for ten years, and i feel like i have a pretty good relationship with them.  i got over a bad trip.  i've never lost control.  but i've always taken quite a lot.  at least a couple of hits.  this was different.  it was more like regular consciousness.  i made drawings and they were actually good.  i recorded some music and it was recognizable as such later on.  conversations made total sense.  but it was all psychedelic.  just not so perfectly removed from the regular everyday brain state.  it has enabled me, since then, to reconcile the two ways of thinking, and to adopt a more psychedelic aproach to life. ", "and that's the point, really.  to change your life and the way you see reality.  to expand.  not just for one insane evening, but for the rest of your life.  so i would recommend giving it a shot.  try a couple of subtle trips.  meditate, if you're so inclined.  slowly it will seep into your daily life and you'll be capable of that kind of thought all the time.  good luck.", "The headline in the paper said 'local teen claims he is god.'  The article read that a local teen alledged of been on LSD was arrested for disruption of peace, disortly conduct, resisting arrest, and a whole other list of what seemed to be petty charges.  But the article forgot to mention a few details. And I know because I was there, it happened at my house.", "My boyfriend, three of his friends, and I went to a party and bought some acid.  Each of us had taken two purple gel tabs.  All of us except for one of my boyfriends friends had taken gel tabs before.  James had only tripped one time and it had been off of one hit of blotter.  ", "My boyfriend and his friends headed back to our house and me and one of my girlfriends went to Perkins to get something to eat.  We had just gotten oiur food and I was starting to feel sick.  My friend said that I looked kind of pale and I went to the bathroom and threw up.  Before I puked I hadn't started tripping, but as soon as I walked out of the bathroom my buzz majorly kicked in.  I didn't feel sick any more and I felt really good.  On my way home I was seeing really awesome chasers off the stars.  I thought it was going to be the best trip that I had ever had.  I was going to find out very soon that I was wrong.  ", "I got back to my house and started to watch T.V. The boys were in the kitchen doing something.  My boyfriend told me that he and one of the other boys were going to go get something to eat and that they would be back. (Note:  I was Trippin' I forgot that he told me that.)  So they leave and I go in the kitchen with Jeremy and James (the two friends that were still there.)  Now I had tripped a few times before this and I had never had a bad experience with acid.  I always had a really good time and I laughed a lot. Even the first time that I did it, and the same with all of my friends that had done it.  (and we were not big drug doers.  We smoked weed and that was it.)  ", "So James seems to be getting kind of uneasy.  And he asked me 'Where did Mike go?' (Mike was my boyfriend)  and I told him that I didn't know.  And he asked me if I was worried about him and I told him no.  So about five seconds later James asks me the same question.  So I give him the same answer. Jeremy noticed that James was acting kind of funny so he told him that Mike went to the store and that he would be right back.  (because we forgot where he told us that he went.)  So James starts to get really weird.  And he looks right at me, almost like he was looking in me and he askd me 'is this the truth?'  and I had no fucking idea what he was talking about.  And I just looked at him funny.  Because it wasn't that he was asking me if Mike really went to the store, I didn't know what he wanted to know.  So them he gets real excited and he says , 'We're tripping on acid.  We're tripping on acid!'  And then we asked if this was reality.  I told him that it was and that we were just tripping and everything was okay.  So he was like, 'I like you.' And I told him that I liked him to.  And he said, 'No.  I don't think you understand.  I like you.'  So I got the hint and told him that that was very nice of him to say but that I already had a boyfriend.  And he wasn't satisfied by that.  He was like, 'Just tell me that you like me.' And he gave me this really evil look and I shit you not he drilled into my head and asked me, 'where is Mike then?'   and I got really scared then and I yelled. 'I told you that I didn't know!'  and he got really quiet and he said 'Mike is dead.'  and I was like 'No, that's stupid.' but since I was tripping I started to think about it and it did seem like he was gone for a really long time and we were all tripping, so I started to get worried.  But then I was like no way.  But James was convinced and he kept looking at me asking me the same question in my head. (now I don't know anything scientific about this, but once my boyfriend told me that if two people are tripping that they can talk to each other and not say anything.  ", "Up until that point I thought he was full of shit, but I swear on my life and I swear to this day that James and I were going back and forth, and not saying anything out loud.)  So I'm starting to freak out now.  Yelling to James, in my head, to shut the fuck up and leave me alone.  And then he says with dead serousness, 'Mike is dead and you're my girlfriend now, and this is my house.'  and Jeremy finally speaks up and says, 'no, this is not your house.  And there are two other roommates upstairs who aren't tripping who are trying to sleep.'  And then James told Jeremy that he looked like a vampire and told him not to talk anymore.  I looked at James, and I mean this was the first time that I realized that I was looking at him and he looked like he was dead.  He was really tall and skinny and his face was almost a yellow color and his lips were purple and his eyes looked really blank.  So I said that I was going to go upstairs and go to sleep.  I got halfway up the stairs and James grabs my arm and drags me back into the kitchen.  He sits me down in a chair and tells me that I'm not allowed to move.  And then he puts his arms around my head, almost like in a headlock, and starts breathing really heavy.  I was like fuck this and I got up and I ran up the stairs. (like in the scary movies when the girl goes up the stairs when she should really leave the house.) And I go up into my girfriend Meg's room, and I tell her to lock her door. ", "All of a sudden I hear this like crashing downstairs and I'm trying to explain to Meg what was going on.  The I hear James making all of these sex noices and he was yelling my name.  Now up until this point this boy had barely spoken to me.  He was always very quiet and polite.  Then he was yelling, 'where are you?  I can feel you.' and a few more explicit things that I don't care to go into detail about.  And then I heard a bang and I heard him coming up the stairs.  He went right to Meg's door and started pounding on it.  Demanding that I come out.  He got down on the floor and was sticking his hand undre th door going ,'Oh, I can feel you.  Let me in!'  I by this point was sitting on the bed bawling, but trying to be as quiet as I possibly could and just praying that the whole thing was just a bad dream and that it would be over soon, or that Mike would come home, or anything.  And I wanted to put my head right through the wall.  We wanted to call the cops, but we didn't have a phone in the room.  Finally James was making so much noise that our other roommate woke up.  And we heard him come out of his room and go, 'Dude what the fuck.'  And James said, 'I'll suck your dick.'  and our roommate started swearing and then we heard this big rukus in the hall.  Meg opened the door a crack and then shut it really quick.  She said, 'OH my god.  He is buck naked.'  I guess he tried to grab our roommate and our roommate tackled him to the floor and beat the hell out of him.  Then our roommate called the cops and told us not to come out of the bedroom until the cops got there.  Like that was an option.  James continued to lie on the floor and scream out my name until the police got there.  When they got there they brought an ambulance.  James trold the cops that he didn't care what they did to him because he was God and he created everything.  And he kept yelling that he had figured 'IT' out and htat he was the smartest man alive.  The cops thought that it was kind of funny.  I didn't.  They finally took him out in a straight jacket.  Just as they were taking him out Mike and his friend came home.  Mike said that James was screaming about how he had figured it out and then yelled to Mike that he wasn't gay.", "A policeman came to talked to me and there was no way I was going to tell him what really happened, so I just told him that I was sitting at my house and Jmes just walked in and started flipping out.  And the cop said, 'well I heard there was some LSD going around.'  (thanks for the tid bit officer.)  So after everybody was cleared out I went to the bathroom and threw up, again.  And I just laid in my bed and cried until I went to sleep.  To this very day James is not the same.  In fact now he's referred to around town as Crazy James.  I don't live in the town anymore and I don't usually like to tell people about what happened, but in a small town everybody knows everything anyway.  A year later I did acid again.  And I was fine.  After the whole thing happened I went online and looked up everything that I could find about LSD.  I read a book called 'Using LSD to heighten the Buddhist Tibetan Experience' and it tells you how to prepare for using LSD and how to calm someone down who is having a bad trip.  What I've learned in all my experiences with LSD (because this was not the first bad trip that I've seen, but definitely the worst.) I've come to realize an important lesson.  A weak mind can't handle a strong drug.  You have to be totally comfortable with who you're tripping with.  And just have fun don't be scared.  Now as far as talking without saying anything...it hasn't happened since, but if it does happen to you just hope that it somebody that you feel okay about it happening with.  And be careful.", "Ive tripped hundreds of times and this one time i am about to tell you about was the scariest thing in my life. One day my friend jami and i was going to trip (nothin unusual for us) and we always take at least 5 hits. That day we decieded to take a 10 strip apiece. We ate it at my house and had no plans but to trip, so we started off on foot walkin to this guys house about 3 miles away. It wasnt even a mile down the road the potent acid was kickin in.", "My mind started to wonder off and think. We began to walk really fast. we were about half way there and we passed this old school and there were people on the playground they began to yell at us. By that time my mind was at top speed and I was in a scared state of consciouness. The people were really there, but we were too scared to even look their way. i know i was going on a bad one because i started to think about the weed in my pocket i was about to throw it away because i thought forshore the cops were going to stop us (which in reality no cops were going to stop us for no reason.) ", "We got to the main road and we had to cross it. damn i didnt even think about that before we left. I was really having trouble talkin and comprehinding at this point. The cars were going by us and all i seen was tracers as far as you can see, thats what made crossing the road so hard (lucky i made it a cross to tell you about it) me and my friend and i made it across the road we looked at each other and said 'we'll talk when we get there' cause we were having to concentrate on everything else that was going on such as cars cause we were still on roads just anything cause when your this high EVERYTHING IS CRAZY.", "We start walkin up this hill to get to this guys house. Here is when it starts getting bad I ASKED WERE WE WERE AT AND IVE WALKED UP THIS HILL A MILLION TIMES. but the thing is I hardly ever hung out at the guys house we were going to and hardly never hungout with any of the people either (i should have thought about set and setting before i went up here and put my self into a bad situtation) We get to the guys house and at first it was cool me and my friend put on pink floyd and sat back and looked at everything turn tyedie and swril and spin around. Then before i knew it i was scared as hell for no reason THIS WAS THE SCARIEST THING IN MY LIFE AND FOR NO REASON. I CANT EXPLAIN THE FEAR I FELT.", "I began to hear sirens and get extreamly paranoid and the setting was totaly not good ive never chilled at this guys house before and hardly didnt know these people. (my fault for putting my self in this situation) This feeling of never coming down  was so strong i was convinced i was dying and it was the end and the more i thought about what was going on the more the feeling grew. Before long the whole house knew what was going on.i was hiding in the guys room completly terrorfied hearing sirens thinking people were coming to get me.", "Then I began to get violent.  I told everybody that they were against me and i hated them and then they tried to calm me down and i then told them that i loved them then it would start back worse than ever. they tried to take me outside to get my mind off of the bad trip but the feeling just keep getting worse i was running away from them in the road and then get a little ways away and run back to them and then when i got back to them i thought it was my enemies again. By then i was screaming out stuff off the top of my head about different girls ive been with, me going to jail (which ive never been at all) thinking my truck was wrecked (which my truck was totaly fine) my hair was sticking straight up it had looked like i had been swimming i was beating up everybody (i had super human strenght) it took 3 guys to hold me back and they were still having a hard time.", "I was so scared i called my mom (big mistake) by that time the guys mom and dad at the house knew what was going on cause i was screaming that i was never coming down and all that other crazy stuff i was doing. they got on the phone with my mom and told  her were they lived and got my mom right up there. my mom came though the door and there for a sec i was alright (i guess the trust and safety i felt around her made me feel good) i went and gave her a hug and then i flipped out again and tried to hurt her (i so wish that didnt happen).", "They called the cops that instant i had no idea what the hell was going on i just thought it was the end. The cop comes in and i try to attack him he sprays me with Mace and gets me down (i was screaming lets just smoke weed. what the hell was i thinking) the paramedics came in and gave me a shot of thorazine. then off to the hospital.", "I kind of remember the ambulance ride not really. i came to in the hospital and this women started asking all the question (i just said i dont know to everything she asked) i was still seeing all the crazy visuals but my mind was back as if i had a good acid trip (thorazine is good stuff) my mom was standing over me and saying you did it this time (i was thinking damn how could this happen to me) i felt like shit cause i flipped out at a guys house i hardly ever hangout with his parents were there. my hospital bill was $2500; an expensive acid trip. they released me and it was as if i was on a good trip i came home and sat down on my bed and smoked a little weed and thought how crazy that shit was.", "NOW THIS IS A LESSON YOU CAN TRIP THOUSANDS OF TIMES AND HAVE GOOD ONES BUT THEN YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT COULD GO BAD.", "I was not at all an experienced drug user. It was my freshman year in high school and I had been smoking weed for approximately 2 years and I drank, but that's as far as my drug use went. Well, I had been wanting to try harder and better things for a while and then my friend gave me 2 geltabs (I cannot recall what kind, but someone I know who has tripped over 120 times told me it was very strong!). Well, it was after school and I was alone so I decided not to take it.", "The next day in school I realized I still had the 2 tabs on me. I was really bored and it was right after 2nd period, 10 am. I told my druggie friend what I had and she told me to take it. I thought it sounded like a good idea since I figured she could take care of me if something went really wrong, and I was really bored. Well, I popped both in my mouth. Not much later, I started feeling crazy and out of control. Everything looked really funny. They took me to the locker room in the gym and I sat there and started bugging out. They knew it was a bad idea for me to go to class, so I just sat there. I started seeing all sorts of crazy things, even though none of it was there. I was really scared and I realized I was fucked up badly. The teacher came in to yell that we couldn't just sit there, we had to go to class. I saw monkeys dancing around and a dog on the floor. ", "My friends realized that if an official saw me they would know I was fucked up. They tried to take me out of the locker room but I was too busy crying that the dog couldn't come with us. They picked me up and dragged me out of there. They decided to bring me to lunch where I could sit and relax. But the walls in my school were really curvy and there are like a million turns. I kept feeling as though the walls were going to get me and hit me. Then I finally got to the stairs and they totally bugged me out. I refused to walk and began to crawl up the stairs. Then they heard the dean start to come to scream for us to get out of the hallways and into class. They knew they couldn't have the dean see me crawling up the stairs so they brought me to the bathroom. I started bugging out in there. ", "They decided to bring me to my bio lab class and I could sit there because the teacher already knew me and my friends were druggies, so we knew he wouldn't care. I sat at my table just staring at it, thinking there were all sorts of colors even though it was white. The teacher just ignored me. Then I got real hot and went to the window. I was so hot I stuck my whole body out the window and almost fell out. Then the dean came into my class and said they had to speak to me. I was so scared. I left the room and said I wanted my friend that was with me in class to come with me. So they said she could come. They brought me to the bathroom and started questioning why I looked so funny. I said I had been sick and vomited and also had an asthma attack. They said ok, they were going to go get the nurse and to stay there. ", "Now, I wasn't really seing crazy things as much, but I was so scared and nervous and paranoid they would figure out what was wrong. My friend kept trying to calm me down but I just started crying and couldn't stop. Then the nurse and the dean came back and they were like, what's the matter, are you okay? Why are you shaking so much? I said I just didn't feel well and that after my asthma attacks I start to shake because I get myself so worked up and scared, and that I would be fine and I wanted to go back to class. They said no and took me downstairs. They said my friend had to go to class, though. I really didn't want her to leave and started crying again. They took me to the office and made me call my mom. ", "I told her I just hadn't felt well and I would be fine and she was like, you want me to come pick you up and bring you to the doctor? I was like nooo, because I knew a doctor would figure it out. Well, to make this very long story end, they let me go and suggested to my mom that I get drug tested. After that I was fine and felt better the rest of the day. I learned a lot from that day. I put myself in a bad situation. You should not do something where there is a chance you can get in trouble around a lot of officials and school is not a place for drugs. ", "If you want to try something or do drugs, don't do them in school. Also, I should have learned more about the drug and the effects and I should have been more prepared for what could happen. I have since done acid again many times and have now done many other drugs as well. I have never again had a bad trip or any other experiences or problems like that and have never come so close to being caught again. That was the worst experience of my life and it taught me a lot of life lessons. It prepared me really well for the drugs I have done since then.", "LSD is the most amazing physocactive wonder in the entire world. It is a marvel that helps me and many other create a world in there mind that is different from the outside world and one that one can live out all there dreams and nightmares for that matter. ", "I had one of the most wonderful experiances of my life on the wonderful drug of LSD. My dosage was 5 liquid hits and I am at shame to admit my age of only 15 years old with such strong drug experiances. Me and a friend of mine named D. Bought 4 sugar cubes two for each of us. My friend in the car put 5 liquid hits on two cubes (2 on one, 3 on the other) at 12:45 AM. I went home and immediately me and D. dosed all of the hits. ", "It was a over an hour before I started to take any notice and I didn't even take notice until after smoking a boul out of 'big red' properley titled because of it size and after my favorite football team the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Then we went upstairs and started playing a multi-player game on my Nintendo 64 and then it started to begin. ", "I had the most intense feeling to kill everyone in the game. I started shooting anyone and everyone while watching light spectrums on the big screen zooming in and out. I saw tracers fly past every bullet. My heart pounded. After about 25 more mintues I started my very long peak. At which point things got very interesting. ", "This is 100% fact and is in no way shape or form made up. It began with seeing players from the game in the house. I was starting to feel as if I was in the game and I had a gun of my own. I then without any reason at all stuck my face to the tv and for about an hour I thought I was in the game. My friend D. told me I was sitting the whole time but in my mind I would fly around corners shooting my bullets with tracers golare. ", "When I got hit with a bullet I could almost feel it in my body. I started to get upset and started to go insane. Running all over the map shooting anyone and everyone who opposed me. I begain screaming wildly. I remember once I was being chased so bad I aimed the gun at my head and pulled the trigger four times. Each time I could feel the bullet pierce my skin but when I checked nothing had happened. I turned around fell over and began to throw up humungous chunks. I thought I was dying in real life or at least something bad was going to happen. I came down to my computer and wrote the following lines.", "'As I sit here I feel as if I am going insane. I see visions of blood, god, warriors and war. I cannot escape it and I fear I will be in this world for the rest of my physcotic life'", "I know not all what I went through. I have been through very much for my age. In my opinion, LSD is the drug that will help anyone deal with anything.", "I'd like to share some of my experiences with you, and hopefully illuminate your own understanding of the psychodelic experience, and perhaps help myself understand where I've been.", "   The first time I took LSD was the best. It was a half tab of some home made and I went to a rave and danced all night. I spent the entire trip in a decent atmosphere surrounded by people who were into having a good time. No negative vibes in the air, and I was still young (18) and optimistic. It was the beginning of a long slide into the dark world of drug abuse.", "   About three months later a friend and I decided to take the mother of all trips. We started around 11:00 PM on the harbour front in my hometown (a nice Canadian tourist town) and took what probably amounted to a quad of blotter each. We then smoked some massive reefer (a gram joint) right down to the cherry. The pot hit quick and we walked along the harbour wall. The LSD ascent was rapid, and before too long we were giggling and staring at each other in amazement as to how fucked up we were. That afternoon we toured all the local attractions: Undersea World, Wax Museum, History Museum, and the park. The experience was truly amazing, nothing psychological, all of it pure visual/auditory hallucination and body rockin'. The comedown was clean. This was to be the last good trip I had.", "   A year later I was far deeper into the drugs, taking more pot than I needed to, and drinking heavily. I had left home and was living amongst the drugged. It was a dark place, and not at all condusive to happy tripping. I was involved in an interesting experiment.", "   A friend of mine was thinking of buying some sheets of LSD from a supplier, and he wanted me to test it out for him. In the middle of the night I met the supplier at a local doughnut shop, and he gave me two tabs of what he claimed were double hits. One had purple dinosaurs on it, the other blank. I popped the dino and started walking to meet my friend. The walk was about six kilometers to a house I had only visited in the day, and so sure enough I got lost. I had only been walking for an hour, and not feeling the effects decided to pop the other tab. I wandered around the neighbourhood where I figured my friend was hanging, waiting for me to show. I burned through a pack of Marlborough red in the space of an hour. I stopped to drink from people's garden hoses, I was so parched. ", "Finally, somewhere in the darkness I heard someone whisper ' 'ere ' and I could see a glowing cherry shining in the shadows. I hobbled over, and there was my man, holding a joint out for me to take. Which I did, and toked heavy before collapsing backward onto the grass. I was in the backyard of the place I was supposed to be at. The grass felt amazingly soft and I could have lay there forever if not for the others around. My friend was asking how it was, and all I could say was 'Fuckin'-A, fuckin'-A'. After two hours of walking, I felt the effects of the high here. I was enraptured by the play of colors across a spiderweb in the window. I was pretty high, and at this point it was all visual hallucination. We went inside, I grabbed some food out of the fridge. This house was not mine, and the food certainly wasn't, but I was in that godhead mode where, if I want it, I can find the shortest path to it, and take it. Megalomanic selfishness! ", "Anyhow, I grabbed the food without complaint, chomping down an apple and a carrot. We retired to the basement and played some computer games. Or I should say 'tried to play'. I couldn't get past the configuration screen. It was Doom, a game where you run around trying to shoot your buddies. My friend loaded it up for me proper, but I couldn't get into it. I couldn't kill my friends. I just ran around the game board asking 'is this all we do? Kill each other? what's the point?' I retired to a corner of the room and worked out a plan to take over the world. There were three of us in that computer room, two guys on the game and me on the LSD. I stared at them playing the game, thinking 'fuck man, these guys are wasting their time with this shit, let's get global and take things over!' I tried to relate these glorious plans to them, but they kept saying 'oh you're high, talk to us when you come down'. ", "Sure enough I didn't come down at all and the sun began to rise. Everyone went off to bed, and no one mentioned it to me that it would be okay for me to pass out there, so I felt like a complete stranger in this house. I hurriedly grabbed my coat and hit the door. It was a cold morning, October 23rd, 1993. I was wasted. I tried to leave the neighbourhood but I couldn't! I would run halfway down one street and then realize I had to go back to the house. I would head back to the house and realize I had to go home. It was a weird causality loop that eventually had me wandering the neighbood crossroad in a circle. I felt I couldn't go to any of the houses for assistance, obviously, because I was fucked out of my mind and they would call the cops! ", "After circling for a while, I felt tired and decided to lay down on the ground, right on the cold concrete on the road, and try to sleep. That's when death came for me. I felt my heart slow, then stop. It seemed like people surrounded me, taking my pulse and asking if I was all right. I couldn't respond. I was lying there, completely paralyzed. Then I heard someone say 'this one's gone, let's get out of here' and terror seized me then. I leapt up and began to run that same loop again, of heading down a street and back to the house. My thoughts went back to the moment I dropped the acid. Time was distorted. One moment I was in the doughnut shop talking to the supplier, then I was back at the house talking to the people there, and then I was in the street. I heard my friend say 'Join the human race, man' and one of the girls that was at that house say 'we are your friends, don't you care about us? what about your family? what will they think about this?'. ", "Again I was seized with terror as I realized my father would just shit when he found out about this. Up to now my father had a fairly good idea that his son was a worthless drug addict, but he'd never had any concrete evidence. If I got caught in this situation, he would have me over a barrel. I looked up to the sky, and there in the pink morning sky, a white-bearded old face looked down at me and my addled mind told me it was God, and in order to redeem myself, I had to come down, become a priest, and spread the word of God among the masses. I agreed, my mind shouted, anything to end this confusion! Then I went into another loop, this time fully within my mind, where I was searching for a word. If only I could find this one word, I could break these loops and go home, everything would be all right. I paced in a tight circle, wracking my brain for the word, what was it, what could it be? Then it came to me: Life! The word was life! It wasn't just to realize it, I had to shout it out at the top of my lungs for all the world! So there I was, 5 AM in a deserted intersection, this skinny, dirty, drug-crazed kid, screaming Life! Life! Life! at the top of his scratchy lungs. The cops came.", "   This is when it started to get really bad. So there I am, screaming, and I hear the noise of an engine behind me. I slowly turn, and a car is bearing down on me! I feel an impact - and then there are two cops standing in front of me. 'What's happening, son? What's going on?' they ask. I mumble something about overdosing on LSD. They decide I need to take a ride with them, which was the absolutely last thing on my mind. I resist, and they cuff me and toss me into the back of the cruiser. It was the puke-mobile, for those of you with experience, the one with the hard plastic rear seat. I didn't know this, and being thrown into a car with a hard plastic seat scared the hell out of me. I started screaming again, Life! Life! but the cops didn't care. We moved.", "   I was given a full head job by these cops. One of them kept asking me questions and answering them for me. 'What's your name? Beezlebub? Satan? The devil?' I got scared. I thought I saw my house, and when I said so, they told me I wasn't going there, no one wanted me there. So they took me to the hospital. I was dragged out of the car, and through the back entrance of the hospital. They took me to a small room and restrained me, face down, to a bed. I got shot in the ass with something, probably a dopamine, to this day I have no idea. Then they left me there. The door was a big steel job with a locking bolt ratchet across the middle of it, and I felt like I was in an asylum. ", "I lay there for a while, then I became convinced that the Cenobites from Clive Barker's Hellraiser were coming for me. They would come right through the wall and flay my worthless ass, then drag me off to hell for some unending torment. Like this present condition wasn't enough. The cuffs were burning my wrists from my struggling. I still have scars on my wrists from this. Well the Cenobites didn't come (maybe my screaming Life! Life! kept them at bay) but something worse did. This haggardly nurse with a face of dripping wax told me she was coming back in a while to do some bloodwork. Now you probably know bloodwork is a common term for taking and analysing blood. I didn't. I was scared shitless. They came and took the blood without flaying me, and I began to feel somewhat sane again. I slowly came down, and they gave me some food, and then my father was there to take me home. This really freaked me out because I don't recall giving the cops any information about myself, and I wasn't carrying my wallet at the time either. ", "He took me home, absolutely disgusted with me (I don't blame him) and I passed out in my old room. I woke up some ten hours later and still didn't feel normal, but I had to go to work. It felt like my reality had been turned inside out. Yet I knew I was alive, and that relief overcame my feelings of dread. I went to work, related some of the story to my boss, and went back home. It would be three months before my confidence returned.", "    With an experience like that, you'd think I would have had the sense to quit all together? No. I carefully looked back at that experience with an objective eye and saw it for what it was. I needed to take the LSD at that time to show myself the depths to which I had sunk. The whole god/Cenobite thing was a pure product of my subconsious, all of the images known to me. I was afraid, deep down, of facing my fears of death, and of facing up to real living, away from drugs. It wasn't until two years later that I would fully be free from drugs, but this was a major step in that direction. It would not be the last trip however.", "   It was the night of my twentieth birthday when I tripped on LSD for the last time. I was at a party, and it just happened. An old friend of mine was going to drop, and for some reason, I felt I had to drop with him. So we popped a double tab of blotter each, and went off with a third friend to my apartment. The plan was to chill there and just trip in peace, or maybe take a walkabout. We got to the pad but the other guys wanted weed. So the third friend called his dealer, and we agreed to walk out to meet him. Stepping back outside (I was living downtown at this point, in a seedy shit bachelor apartment in the low-rent drug red-zone) the LSD kicked me like a mule. I was soaring. We headed down the street to the dealer's place, and on the other side of the street I saw a rag-tag aboriginal family trudging in the opposite direction. I swear to god they were calling out my name 'Christopher! Where are you? Christopher!' and it freaked me out, because my mother is aboriginal, and I felt that this was the family I had abandoned. ", "I dwelled on this for only a bit, because at the next major intersection, the third friend started screaming into traffic 'Whooooo! Whoooo! Isn't this great? Walking around downtown just completely fucked? Whooooo!' He was hanging off a lamp-post into traffic, and at that point, put into that perspective, I couldn't think of anything worse than walking around downtown fucked up. What if the cops stopped us? As the signal changed to let us cross, I waited until the two friends were walking before rapidly retreating back to my apartment. I rushed in, took the elevator up to the third, and locked my door. I ripped off my boots, and cowered in bed, fully clothed. ", "Sure enough, the guys figured out I was gone and came back. The apartment buzzer blasted through my waking dream and I cowered deeper into the covers. They screamed up from the street 'Chris! Chris!' This freaked me out more. I simply tried to disappear. Eventually they left, and then tried to call from a phone. I tore the phone out of the wall. Finally, I would have peace. It was 2 AM.", "   There was a late night pizza place, Romeo's, below the north window of that apartment, and I could hear tons of bass coming from there. I went to the window, and hung out over the street. It seemed like the street was full of taxis, stretching as far as I could see to the west. In the parking lot, all manner of cars were parked, and people were partying. It was too much for me, so I headed back to the bed. I tossed and turned, trying to sleep. I cast furtive glances at my boots, there by the door, thinking 'shouln't I be somewhere? I should be walking somewhere'. A serious hole opened in my fabric of reality - literaly! The black and shimmering hole opened above my bed, and I could put my hand into it! I looked at the clock. It was 1:36 AM! How could this be? I had gone backward in time? I was tripping now for sure. ", "There was no real apprehension or terror here, not like that trip two years before, just a sense of 'wow, I am so totally fucked up, and it's my birthday' Some time later I was able to think in sequence enough to go into the bathroom and take a shower. It felt like my body was just covered in a grease I couldn't remove. I stared at my nakedness in the mirror and thought 'man, I am so unhealthy and ugly' It was largely true. Four years of drug abuse had not been kind to my frame. My bones were clearly visable below my sallow skin, and my face was covered with pocks and pimples. I cried. What had become of me? Again and again the realization came that I was twenty years old and I hadn't done a damn thing worthwhile. ", "I flicked on the television, and all the early morning children's shows were on. Yet in each and every one the message was the same: Make friends of your enemies. I thought, it's so true, how many people do I hate that don't even deserve it, and I am the one I hate. It's all in me, I am the only one who affects my reality, and this is what I have done. What a failure. I was coming down, but not fast enough. I had to meet my family in the morning for my 'birthday party'. I was still high when my father came to get me. We drove towards the family house and a kid on a skateboard crossed the road in front of us, tried a trick, and bailed. My father said 'He thinks he's so cool!' and I felt he was talking about me, about my lifestyle. It was terrible. I was so pitiable. We got to the house, and there my three totally clean family members gathered around me and stared at me with open disgust. They knew I was a drugged-out loser who didn't deserve a show of affection, even on his birthday. I took the cards, cried again, and went home.", "   Bad trip? Hardly. Perhaps this was the best trip of all. I learned all I needed to learn. From that day on, five years ago, I have devoted all my time to improving myself. I am clean, no drug use, no alcohol use. I eat healthy, and exercise regularly. I am a beautifully solid 180 lbs, with clear skin and a positive glow. I married last year to a beautiful woman who has taught me more about myself than any drug ever could. ", "   Are drugs good or bad? Drugs are drugs, and they have their uses. It's like medicine. If you're sick, you take it. I think that most of us are in some way psychically sick, and this is the reason so many of us are drugged... ", "   Thank you for your time, if you took the time to read this, and I hope it has helped you in some way. I know it helped me.", "My then-boyfriend and I decided to do acid one summer evening.  He had done it many times before, and I had done it just a couple of times.  We dropped about 4 hits of liquid onto sugar cubes and ate them at about 5pm.  The come-on was rather quick - at about 5:30 I watched the shingles on the neighbor's roof melting.  And it all went quickly downhill from there.", "It was probably about 5:45 when we went onto the roof of our building to see the view.  I got scared up there and tried to come back into the apartment (we lived on the top floor), but got 'lost' and couldn't figure out what apartment was ours.  I finally got inside and became even more confused.  Here I started losing touch with reality.  I went into the bathroom and saw a new package of toilet paper.  I remembered buying it, but I knew there was no way I could have bought it in my current state, so I surmised that I didn't always feel this way.  About the same time, I remembered that I had started a new job the week before and I knew I couldn't work feeling like this, so I must sometimes feel differently than this, but how?  I asked my boyfriend what was wrong with me?  Had we taken drugs?  He said yes.  I really wanted him to sit with me then, but he was tripping so hard that we couldn't communicate.  I went and sat on the couch and thought, 'If I can go to sleep, I'll feel better when I wake up.'  I was *really* scared; I couldn't remember what my life was like - all I knew about was reality as it existed for me at that particular moment, and it was not pleasant.  I just wanted it to stop.", "I have a vague memory of taking a shower; I assume this was at the beginning of the trip.  I know I threw up somewhere in this first hour, but I don't remember getting sick - I just remember cleaning it up later that night.  I was told that at one point I collapsed on the living room floor, but I don't remeber that either.  Other than that, I came to in my bed about 10pm.  I have no idea how I got there or what I was doing for the previous four hours.  From that time on it was like a 'normal' acid trip.", "Because I was so scared and so far gone, it was a full three years before I ever did drugs again.  (I have since candyflipped twice and had great experiences.)", "The moral of the story is: Don't take acid for granted, and Err on the side of under-dosing.", "I am a college student who had dabbled with mushrooms and ecstasy and a few other things (ether, special k, of course weed), but I was quite nervous about taking LSD, due to what I had heard about the drug in the past.  I feared permanent insanity, flashbacks, and doing something drastic and fatal, such as jumping out of a window.", "Finally, I decided that I would try acid.  I was visiting friends in New York (I live in California) who have tripped many times, and they asssuaged my fears enough to where I felt reasonably comfortable.  We dropped two hits each in the car on the way back from LaGuardia airport on our way to a rave in the South Bronx.  The acid was on pez candies.", "I felt the threshold effects while we were still in the car, and it reminded me of mushrooms, the sort of anxious, uneasy feeling you get before the drug peaks.  Finally, after driving around for awhile, we arrived at the rave.  It was at a rundown old rollerskating rink in the Bronx, and it wasn't too crowded.  My only previous experience with a rave was a massive out in Southern California, and this was nothing like it.", "When the drug peaked I was dancing alone in the middle of the rink, and things became very fuzzy and just odd.  Unlike mushrooms, which rendered me grinning like an idiot and really unable to function normally, acid seemed somewhat more controlled, and I felt that I could act normally if I needed to.  Of course, I didn't need to at all, and I was able to relax and enjoy the trip.   I never felt more connected to music before, and I felt that I could predict the direction of the music and that somehow I knew each note before it was played.  ", "I'm not much of a dancer, you won't see me signing up for swing dancing lessons any time soon.  But I danced for hours on acid, feeling completely free from self-consciousness and worry.  Unlike other dancing experiences, such as nightclubs, I didn't feel the need to hit on the cute girls or the rush  of testosterone.  I felt in the mood for thinking, which I did in copious amounts.  I thought about everything I could, and I came to a feeling of peace with the world, not concerned with various inadequacies.", "I didn't have too many hallucinations, though I did see very interesting patterns and sometimes things normally clear were blurry.", "Near dawn (we dropped at around midnight) I started coming back to normal.  Unlike unpleasant side-effects of shrooms and e, I felt content with my acid trip and didn't feel down about being sober again.  Of course, I doubt I was sober....I sat for several hours unable to go to sleep, unable to read, but with a great new experience to think and talk about.", "I know a lot of people who do ecstasy routinely but refuse to try acid for the same reasons I was nervous.  They believe in myths such as doing it a certain number of times (like 8) will make you legally insane.  I don't see myself as a prophet, I'm not Ken Kesey or Timothy Leary or Grace Slick or anyone, but all things considered, acid is the best drug experience i've ever had.  If you're careful, reasonably secure with yourself, and safe with your setting and people, you could have a really mind-blowing experience.", "Hello!  My name is Sam.  I'm 27 years old and I have been using LSD and other entheogens for about 18 months.  I've been reading a lot lately about 'bad trips'.  I've even heard about a couple from aquintances.  Most of these tales go a little like,  'I took a lot of acid this one time and I had a really bad trip...I don't even want to talk about it...so I'm never taking acid again.  I'll just stick with pot.'", "I'm really at a loss.  Let me first explain my experience with this 'bad trip' phenomenom.  I have had two so-called bad trips on LSD.  The first was on four geltabs.  A friend and I went to the bar where we work after hours all by ourselves.  It's a local nightclub and we figured it would be a great place to trip.  We fired up the DJ booth and set in with some serious jungle/breakbeat techno.  The first two hours went fine.  We experienced the initial grip of the beast...intensity.  Then we moved on into the chatting stage.  We discovered undeniable truths together and sharpened our 'acid wit' on each other.  Then we went our separate ways as was par for the course so far.  I found myself sitting on a couch contemplating my little world and I began to sink.  That's the only way I can explain it.  I felt I was sinking.  The music was just pummeling me.  It was hard, dirty and nasty and so was I.  I kept sinking further, and I began to physically sink into the couch and all this music was on me.  All I could think was how dirty and nasty I was as a person.  I thought it would never end, but I held on.  When the music was over it was gone...like that.  ", "All I could remember was sitting on the couch and feeling a maternal figure showing me a mirror.  This figure was forcing me to deal with myself, and it did so with the same love and temperament that a mother would in teaching her child to tie his shoes.  After that, all I could do was smile and the rest of the trip was the best I'd ever had.", "The second bad trip was almost identical.  Same dose, but I was at home and my friend had already passed out.  I, however, was still going strong.  I decided it would be a good idea to watch the movie '8mm'...bad call!  The 'bad trip' was similar, I felt like I was sinking and the movie made feel dirty, but it was intensified tenfold.  I couldn't get away from the movie...even when it ended.  I went to my bed because it was the only place in my house I felt safe.  I wrapped myself in a sheet careful not to let anything but the sheet touch me.  I tried to sleep, but a waking nightmare kept me awake and forced me to endure all that it had to offer.  I was finally relieved by the mercy of unconsciousness.  When I awoke I felt as good as I ever had.  I felt purged.", "These 'bad trips' are the best memories I have of LSD.  I don't understand how people can't love them for what they can teach us.  I believe LSD opens doors that normally remain closed, for whatever reasons, and force us to deal with the skeletons that live there.  Then you don't have to be imprisoned by them anymore.  I believe people who quit using LSD because of 'bad trips' are probably using the drug for the wrong reasons in the first place.  I hate even using the term 'bad trip'...I call them 'the real trip'.", "Now, I don't mean to belittle any other entheogens, but LSD isn't for everyone and maybe some people should stick with the less intense variety. But, LSD has a special place in my heart.  LSD is my goody goody.  LSD is the Daddy.  But I will say that I can't wait until I get my grubby hands on some DMT.  'If acid is a slow, strange trip, DMT is like gettng shot out of a cannon'...I can't wait for that.", "I'm not sure how sensitive I am to LSD-25, but I must say that this is the most potent experience I've ever had in my life.  On New Year's Eve of 1999, some friends suggested we all go camping and drop.", "I'll cut to the chase.  My perceptual processes were simply not ready for the rush of everything that happened, and I spent a long period of time adjusting to it all.  Part of it was the acid.  Another major part of it was being out in unfamiliar territory and not feeling so sure of myself to begin with.  Then, there were all the people yelling, the rangers, and the fireworks.  I'm talking massive overload here.  My mind's reaction was to shut down some of the sensory input by turning off different senses.  I spent a brief period of time being blind and another one being deaf.  These both shortly came back to me, however, once I was in a lower-stimulation environment.", "That's when the really bizarre thing happened.  My mind was having a hard time serializing everything into one constant flow.  Effects were sometimes happening before causes.  I soon found myself pretty much trapped in my own mind, and found that my analytical thoughts were being used to process the high levels of sensory input.  My body was running on a sort of natural autopilot (I later found out that nobody thought anything was wrong with me), but I was well lost in my own head, having conversations with archetypes of my friends and watching possible futures unfold before me...different thought patterns would naturally fizzle out and such...eventually, I'd have a window where I could act again.", "The process of action was very difficult for me.  If I wanted to go sit out by the fire, I had to emote it...I had to allow my 'me-ness' to drift toward the 'fire-ness.'  Reality seemed to exist in a state of freeze-frame, too, unless I kept my body moving.  Thus, in order to stay cognizant of things around me, I was constantly tapping my fingers against a surface to keep my mind in motion.", "Eventually, this settled down.  My senses of taste and touch became exceedingly dull, and were for some reason instead rerouted into the tapping of my fingers against a surface.  When given an extremely sour candy that left others writing on the ground in pain, I sucked on it, noticed no flavor, and then found my right hand drumming erratically at the table for minutes later.", "Sunrise came, and it was an incredible experience.  I put on one of my more serene CDs (This Mortal Coil's album titled 'Blood.'  I recommend it.) and stretched out to watch the forest dance lightly to the music and the sunrise.  I then went down by the river's edge and sculpted it in my mind.  I have never in my life seen such incredible beauty.  Sadly, since my emotions had been tied up elsewhere in my mind, and so I found myself indifferent to it.  Never before have I experienced such beauty, and been so unmoved by it.", "My body held onto the LSD pretty tightly, and so I was still feeling the effects hours after everyone else had gone to bed.  Sitting there, alone, in a dark apartment, with nobody to talk to, and hearing the neighbors argue, seemed to dredge up some old childhood fears.  I curled up in a chair, squeezed my old lovvee closely, and wept for a while.  It was hours before someone got up, but when they did, it was nice to have interaction again.", "Finally, it had been about 22 hours since I dosed, and I still hadn't come down.  I was developing a headache, and was getting tired of having no sense of taste or a hand compulsively interpreting different sensations.  One of my friends made a run to the store, and I had her bring me back some Dramamine.  I've used a prescription version of it (though they're pretty much identical) to treat sleep terrors in myself in the past, and have also used it to help a lover fall asleep when she had a severe migraine.  One Dramamine tablet, and fell asleep a half hour later, and never slept better.", "In all, I couldn't sum the experience up as positive or negative.  It was interesting, and I'll definitely be trying it again, although it might be a long time.", "I went to visit some friends in college, and had never tripped before. I had rolled on ecstasy, and that was pretty much the only drug I had ever done. Unless you count Yellow Jackets (Ma Huang). Which aren't really a drug, they're just fucking terrible. I don't even smoke weed or do legal drugs (drink). It's a power play in my mind, because those drugs are so much easier to get. But no one ever really understands, so I'll spare you all. ", "I went to see my friends where they went to college, and a friend and I picked up some acid on the way up there. I'm not really sure of any of the times or anything, but I'll do my best to be relative. Anyway, my friend and I got to the college that night. We took our acid about 30 minutes after we got there. Before and after I took the hit, I was constantly meeting new people, and while I was tripping, I felt like I had the memory of meeting those people before I met them. ", "At the first part of the trip, I just felt a little off, a little goofy. I was talking to people I knew, and their faces would kind of fluctuate in size. I always remained aware that anything weird was due to the drug though. I walked around with some other friends to different rooms, talking to people, and just watching them. We sat in one of my friend's rooms for a while, I attempted to draw, and I could direcly put what was in my mind on the paper as long as I didn't realize what was happening, once I realized I was drawing, I would fuck it up. ", "I went to my other friend's room where they were watching the presidential election unfold. I just sat back with some headphones and listened to massive attack for a long while, it was really nice. I was having fairly bad cyclic thoughts... where I would think something, and it would just manifest until I realized it, and forced myself to think of something else. I could easily see how someone would have a bad trip if they got a negative thought. (analyzing that when I was tripping was pretty hard, because I had to think about negative thoughts, which had a tendency to throw me into a negative thought pattern. But I realized that whenever something is bad, it just gets better...)  I was also experiencing massive time distortion, I don't know really how to explain it, but it felt like everything that was going to happen, everything that had just happened, and everything that was happening for about 3 seconds before and 3 seconds after where I was in time, was condensed into one moment. ", "Overall description of experience: Time distortion, slight alteration of things that were already there, no real hallucinations. More a psychological drug than a hallucinagen. Altered Where, How, and When I felt things. Things easily manifested in my mind, made it easy to get bad thoughts stuck in my head, but it made it easy to get good thoughts stuck in my head. ", "After effects: The next day everything seemed a little colder, and more distant. I still felt a slight seperation of my senses. Things still seem a little colder and more distant almost a month later, not near as bad as the first day after though. Also there have been residuals that last longer than normal in my vision from bright lights.  It's similar to when someone takes a picture and I have the spot in my eyes for a while, but it lasts longer. I don't know if this is from the acid, but I don't believe it was there before, at least not to this extent. Plus there's just an overall feeling that *something* has changed, but I don't really know what. ", "Overall: I don't believe the experience was entirely negative, nor do I believe it was entirely positive. I don't know that I would suggest it to anyone else, but I wouldn't necessarily tell anyone not to do it. I'm entirely sure what I experienced, what I felt, and how it has affected me. But I do believe it changed something. As for if I'll ever do it again, only time can tell.", "I'd always been fascinated with acid, ever since I was 13 or so I'd wanted to try it. Up until then, my drug experiences consisted of smoking weed, almost every weekend in my senior year of high school, and a few times a month since I was 14. As far as alcohol goes, I'd only been drunk twice prior to that, can't stand the taste enough to get drunk easily. ", "The friend of mine that hooked me up with acid got 2 cubes, one for each of us, but he decided not to dose, so he let me have both, each one was from a different supplier as well. The night I decided to do it, he wasn't there, but I was in my house with my two closest friends. I was in my room, which I can only say is PERFECT to trip out in.... posters and all sorts of stuff covered every inch of my walls and ceilings. My dad was still awake, but for some reason I decided to take the first sugar cube. About 45 minutes passed, and I was starting to get pissed, nothing was happening. I decided, what the hell, I'm gonna take the other cube. Let me just tell you, eating a cube of sugar tasted like shit. I was almost gagging, but I managed to swallow it down. About 2 minutes after taking the second cube, the first one started to kick in. Oh shit. I'd just taken two hits of acid for my first time. ", "I immediately started smiling and giggling like mad, my walls had started to 'breathe'. I recall looking at this calendar I had, the picture that month was of a field of red flowers, as I looked at the picture, it was if a wind was blowing through the field making the flowers move.. it was quite beautiful. Kelly, who had tripped 100's of times was trying to fuck with me... but it wasn't working, i was just giggling and talking about all the stuff in my room. My anime posters seemed to be starting at me, but it wasn't frightening, because I knew it was only the effects of the drug... \t", "For the next couple hours I sat around looking at my walls and talking to my friends, at one point I left my room and was talking to my sister and my dad and watching the wooden cabinets swirl... the whorls in the wood had taken up a life of their own. I remember talking to them and in the back of my mind I was thinking 'Whoa shit, the wood is swirlin'.' I'd managed to make it downstairs. I sat on my computer for a while listening to the Beatles white album, Helter Skelter was playing and I was eating canned fruit, the fruit tasted quite normal... but Helter Skelter was a tad bit scary, so I decided to go upstairs again, at this point I was peaking, it must have been around 2-3am... ", "I talked to my friends until they fell asleep, and around 5:30am, I sat on my bean bag watching the sunrise from my bedroom window, it was intensely beautiful. At that point I felt an overwhelming presence of God. Not Jesus/personal God, but a divine energy sort of 'God'. I felt as though for a moment in time I'd experienced the presence of something far bigger than myself. I just clearly remember sitting on the bean bag, with my 2 closest friends sleeping on my bed, watching the sunrise, feeling this presence.", "At that point, I decided to take a shower, my peak was over, and I was feeling the drug wearing off.. my shower curtain was rippling, it felt as though a wind was caressing it... I fell asleep that morning around 6am, a different person.", "After my first trip, I was hesitant to try acid again. My friend J and I were sitting in my car in a parking lot and we were talking..he had some paper acid on him and he gave me a hit..I let it sit on my tongue for a little while and swallowed it.", "My friend 'K' also took a hit, but he was in a different car.", "We all went back to J's house and got out of our cars. I immediately felt the drug kick in. The leaves of the trees looked shiny..purple and orange and green all at once.. I felt like I was on a huge slant and like I would topple over at any moment, but I didn't.", "'K', J and I eventually went into J's room and relaxed for a bit. We all began bugging out on each other. I stared at J for a while, and his eyes started popping out of his head and he looked bug-eyed like hell.

At about 7 AM we were starting to come down, but they both still looked bug-eyed to me..and very skimpy and dirty. I felt dirty too.

I had had a job at this place called the Redwood Grille, where I was a waitress. I hadn't shown up to work for a few days and I was in debt with my parents. They had to pay my car insurance the past month for me because I was jobless, so I was feeling very down on myself for not being able to find a job.", "After I took a shower, I watched 'What Dreams May Come', starring Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding, Jr. I don't know if any of you have seen the movie, but it's about dying and heaven and where we all end up .. it's very beautiful. After watching it, I felt like I wanted to die because everyday problems seemed so obsolete and unimportant in this movie..and that is exactly what I wanted to escape.", "I called my work to find out that I was fired. I was unbelievably depressed and very down on myself.", "I didn't want to burden my parents anymore with my problems and I didn't want them to have to pay MY bills..so therefore, I felt obligated to kill myself.", "Eventually I crawled out of my hole and came out of the house and went down to Burger King, where all of my friends used to chill at.", "I felt untalkative and out of place, once again. I had planned my death perfectly. I was going to drive up a mountain that was in the next town over and drive off of a cliff. It seemed perfect to me. I even explained it to one of my friends, who got very angry at me and wouldn't even talk to me. I didn't mind too much. After talking it over with another one of my friends, I decided it best not to do it..that things would get better. However, I was very upset.", "I went home and sorted things out in my head..

I had this experience on acid; it was fucking insane. I HATE acid.  I know a lot of people that would disagree with me but this is my opinion: Acid is a very dangerous drug and you really do have to be prepared for a trip.  Anything and everything will affect it, even shit from when you were 6 years old.  I've had a really messed up life so the first time I tripped was crazy. Here's my story.....", "One day I was just kickin it with my friends and they invited me to a rave.  It was my first rave so I felt a little awkward there but then I saw a few friends and felt a little more comfortable. It was about 11:30pm when my friend found some acid and we decided we both wanted to trip.  We each bought 5 hits of blotter acid and took them all at once.  At about 12:15, I started feeling weird, not hallucinating, but I just wasn't comfortable and I started noticing things change, like my fingers were discolored and it looked disgusting.  My arms and wrists looked like they were bleeding everywhere and I turned to a friend and asked them if I was bleeding everywhere and they all just sat and laughed at me and told me I was, and that scared the hell out of me.  That's when I realized how fucked up I was. I started to peak an hour later, and when someone talked to me, I couldn't understand them, it sounded like they were rats and they were just squealing so I'd run away...and the bass at the party was making me think like a psycho, like how much I just wanted to kill someone or what if I die....weird thoughts kept going through my head. I didn't know what to do with myself, I started puking, I couldn't understand anyone, my arms and legs felt like they were about to fall off, I thought I was bleeding everywhere, and the worst part is, none of my friends cared.  They just laughed at me like I was their entertainment and pretending all of this.  ", "That's all I remember from there on. I don't remember shit.  All I know is I woke up at my friend's and I was completely out of it for 3 days. I was practically delusional. I wouldn't respond if anyone said my name and I couldn't walk.  Some of the other odd things people said I did:  I tried to run through a brick wall in front of the paramedics, and I was sweating and crying for about 2 hours.  As for my friend, she was hospitalized and put into rehab for months.  The doctors said her heartbeat was going up and down so rapidly she could have died any second....I guess I was just lucky, I took the exact same acid, off the same sheet, the same amount, and we weigh exactly the same.", "That's my story....you might laugh, but believe me, if that was you, it wouldn't be so funny......anyway, if you're gonna do acid, do it in a safe place you're familiar with and with people that care and have done it before.  If it's your first time, know what to expect and don't take more than two hits your first time!!", "I trip sporadically-from every day spanning a week to once every couple months- each time taking in excess of 3 hits.  I usually trip with at least one other person.  My experiences transpire generally with my peers who have dosed smaller amounts than I (e.g. they eat 1-2 tabs while I eat 3-7) and I am much less affected by the drug.  My trips range from no effect at all to a felling of euphoria and/or anxiety accompanied by a most entertaining and subversive train of thought.  Last time I tripped I took 3 hits and my girlfriend took 1 and my trip lasted about an hour and a half.", "I experienced no visual hallucinations, just a heightened perception of beauty in everything around me, and the usual unsusual and insightful train of thought.  I felt high and happy with no ill effects (I have never experienced any ill effects besides a sore neck probobly from looking around so much).  My girlfriend on the other hand had a very intense trip lasting about 10 hours.  We both took the same acid, and we both smoked the same amount of pot.  The pot seems to have little or no effect on my friends and I while we are tripping.  My girlfriend had finally come down around 5 in the morning and she wanted to smoke some pot.  I used the lavatory, noticed my pupils were no longer dialated and returned to pack up a bong.  We smoked about 3 grams of pot and then my girlfriend freaked out and started crying saying that she was still not finished tripping, but then she came to her senses and began to laugh, thinking that the pot had caused this to occour. (is this possible?) I went to look and sure enough my pupils had widened, but I felt no different.  ", "On a seperate occasion I took 5 doses of lsd and felt nothing but a bout of hot flashes and anxiety.  My pupils never dialated but I did feel dosed.  All effects stopped thereafter and my peers who had taken only 1 hit of acid were bouncing off the walls and they ended up having an 8 hour trip. I ended up going to sleep about 2 and a half hours after consuming the 5 sugar cubes.  ", "I have done a bit of searching and cannot find any explanation behind a tolerance to lsd besides dormant or active pschotic disorders.  I am pretty sure I have no psychotic disorder but I have been told I need to be checked for ADD.  I would like to find out any correlations between tolerance and biological/psychological make up.  I smoke pot every day and meditate occasionally.  If any of you guys has any info on this subject I would be happy to hear it.", "The trip began at 12:00 P.M. with 1 hit of blotter paper (I have since realized that I have an incredibly low tolerance for psychedelics). I was over at a friend of mine's house. My friend (now former friend), we'll call her K. also took one hit. We both drank a huge glass of orange juice (Vitamin C supposedly potentiates LSD, although I have read nothing on this subject, so I don't know if it's just a rumor). We were watching movies and the first thing I noticed was a slight increase in color and the fact that K's cigarette had little fire balls following it when she moved it (trails). Nothing much happened for the next 6 hours, when K's friend called to ask if we wanted to come get some marijuana with him. I didn't want to leave because I didn't know if something would happen since we were tripping, but K insisted. ", "K's friend arrived at about 6:00 P.M. and we left with him and some of his friends to get the pot. After we got it we smoked a couple o hits in the car and we headed back home. All of a sudden I felt overwhelmed by something, I flew out of my own body and out the back of the car and I could see myself in a way weirder than an out-of-body because I could see my body in the car and I could see my soul floating above the car all from a different perspective. Everything shifted into cartoon form and looked very fucked up, everything became 2-D and flat. The part of me that was floating above the car changed form so it's now 2-D face grew a zig-zag mustache and one of its eyes became a spinning spiral while the other became a flickering eye of horus, which shot occult symbols out (the symbols were constantly floating around the head). Then the soul's head began spinning and turned into a top on which there were various changing 2-D cartoon faces all with the mustache, eyes, etc. Finaly the face stayed the same, it was the face of my father!", "(By the way, the other part of me, my body, could be seen in the distance screaming and thrashing about waving its hands about thrashing away strange things which flew around its head). Then a strange 'electrical tornado' crashed down upon the 'top' head. Both bodies crumbled to dust and blew away. My position then shifted so I could see out of every dust particle. The particles then spread throughout the universe and absorbed into everything. I have had near death experiences before and this was exactly the same as the others. I existed in everything simultaneously yet I did not exist myself. I could only experience, I could not act. I then suddenly flashed into a somewhat concensus reality only this reality was just as messed up as what I just experienced. I just sat there in a movie theater wondering why I was watching this stupid movie of some people sitting in a car. Then I realized I was supposed to be in the car !!!!!! I tried to force my self back to reality and was some what successful (I would periodically shift back to movie theater vision). When I finally managed to understand what was going on in the car I heard the driver saying 'I have seen people on ten hits of acid and I have never seen anyone that fucked up before.' I tried to tell everyone what just happened and I couldn't manage to articulate my words enough to do so. ", "I had no idea where I was except that I was in a car, I was scared I thought I would either die or go insane forever. I remember one thought going through my head continuously 'I am the biggest lunatic alive. People will charge admission to see me. My parents will feel I am a disgrace and disown me. All because I know the meaning of it all but cannot explain it.' The strange thing about this thought was that I was not consciously thinking it and yet it was running through my head so clearly I could hear it.", "When we got back to K's house her parents asked if I was hungry. I felt sick. My heart was racing so fast I could hear it. I stammered an answer and K pulled me upstairs. I told her I was not okay and I fell to the floor of her room. She ran downstairs to get her parents. Suddenly I felt completely fine and ran to catch up with K. She was telling her parents I was ODing and was going to die. I yelled that I was OK, but no one heard me!? Then K and her parents ran upstairs ... right through me. 'Oh Shit', I thought 'I was dead.' I ran after them and saw my own body on the ground completely still. Then I realized that I hadn't been breathing and had no pulse the entire time I was downstairs. Just as I made the realization I snapped back into my body and told them I had just died and become a ghost. They took me to the hospital and to make a long story short, the doctors did nothing except laugh at me and take blood samples.", "My parents came and picked me up. The only hallucinations I had in the hospital were posters being written in Japanese, Jesus on a cross on a wall talking to me in jibberish, a giant washing machine floating in the middle of the room, out of body experiences (especially when vomitting which occured about 6 times), things becoming cartoon like (again especially while vomitting). Closed eye visuals were so elaborate it is hard to explain them, all of them were 3-D and most of them were 1960's images smiley faces, peace signs, grateful dead bears, etc. or naked people melting together and growing weird limbs and bodily structures all while having intercourse (Note: I didn't close my eyes much because I felt I couldn't open them if I did). That's all folks. Take it for what it's worth, I figure either my tolerance for LSD is extremely low, the pot was laced with something or both. I have also had flashbacks, trails, and mild ego disolution since then. Either way LSD is definitely not getting my recommendation !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "I first tried acid when I was 17 years old. I've never had much interest in drugs. Having smoked pot on several occasions and having never really enjoyed it, I stuck to alcohol. But my best friend, Mary, had tried acid a few times and liked it, and I started to become curious. After much thought, I decided one Friday to cut school with Mary and trip for the first time. I deliberately brought a few toys to entertain us, some water bottles and lollipops (Mary had said she enjoyed sucking on candy while tripping). I also wore comfortable clothes and sneakers, as Mary had said that if an item of clothing is bothering you at all, its annoyance will be heightened while tripping.", "I arrived at Mary's house around 11:45 in the morning and we took the tabs at 12 noon. She, having tripped before, took 2 tabs while I only took a half of one (we had been told by the dealer that each tab was a bit strong so to take them in moderation). We waited around in her house for about an hour, listening to music and going online. Hers started to kick in within the hour, while I still felt nothing. I was disappointed that I wasn't feeling any different, but I was also scared to take another tab because I didn't know what to expect. We left her house and I decided to take another 1/2 a tab (one full tab so far, supposedly at extra strength).", "We met up with a few friends of ours (who didn't know we were tripping) and drove around in their car with them. I still didn't feel any different inwardly but I became slightly more giggly and my friends asked if we had been drinking. We said yes so they wouldn't wonder what was up. I seemingly lost my inhibitions a bit: I started dancing and singing in front of everyone, and was having a good time. I still didn't get any visuals and all my surroundings looked the same. As this had gone on for about another hour, I decided something. I didn't plan on ever doing acid again (I just wanted the experience), so I figured I should take another tab to ensure that I got the most out of the experience. At this point my friends who weren't tripping were playing a game and Mary and I each took another whole tab. ", "The second this tab entered my mouth I felt an inward change. I'm not sure if this was the previous tab kicking in or the one I had just taken was really strong. Either way, Mary had the same reaction and said that my head had just 'spun out of control' and that the 'trees were all fuzzy.' I still didn't have any visuals but I definitely felt strange, so we left my other friends and decided to walk around. ", "I noticed a number of things as the second tab kicked in. Any food I ate had hardly any taste. I couldnt tell how loud I or Mary were speaking. I wasn't sure if we were acting normal or if we were causing a scene. Everyone around us seemed to be speaking a foreign language. We were walking at what we thought was normal speed, but people were passing by us at a rapid rate so we figured we must be walking very slow. It was as if, all of a sudden, we realized that we were tripping and we weren't sure how we had been acting towards people up until that point. In one sense I was worried about this (and I did not want to see anyone that I knew for fear of acting very bizarre in front of them), but in another, I was glad I realized what I was doing and that anything I saw wasn't real. ", "As the evening wore on (it had probably been around 2 hours since I took the 2nd tab), everything around me developed a blue tint. Colors were glowing, I noticed lots of patterns and I could spot every light around me for about a mile because they were glowing stronger. My body felt mushy and soft, and my fingers felt fat and bloated. I was afraid to look in the mirror because I had heard that you can see your skin melting off of you and I wasn't sure I was ready to handle that. I started yearning to see my mother. One definite realization I had while tripping was how much I loved and needed my mother. I also had a male interest at the time, and my desire for him grew stronger during the trip as well. I kept blessing myself with the sign of the cross, but did not realize I was doing it until Mary pointed it out. ", "Mary and I walked around for about another hour. At this point it was about 6:30 in the evening and it was getting dark out. We decided to go to my friend Martin's house and sit around until we came down completely. We watched Martin and his friends play Super Mario, and every level moved so slowly that I thought each one was a water level. Martin was also playing the guitar, and the sound coming from it seemed to stick to him and travel wherever he went. Another hour of this, and we left. Now it was raining out, and the rain splashing in the puddles looked like pins stabbing at water balloons. The splash caused by the rainddrops seemed to be leaping out of the puddle instead of entering it. My friends were smoking cigarettes and the smoke was flowing and beautiful. ", "Mary and I returned to her house at about 10:45 at night. We watched television for a few hours, while the walls in her room were still moving and my body still felt soft and mushy. I tried to recite a few prayers in my head but kept losing my train of thought as I went along. ", "I went home (alone) at about 2 in the morning. I was still sort of tripping but had come down considerably. It took me about 4 hours to fall asleep. ", "I had figured the whole time that this would be my only time tripping, because I dislike the feeling of not being able to have control over my surroundings. With acid, you don't know exactly what to expect. I was disapointed that I didn't really get any visuals, which is something that may make me want to try it again. Since having done it, I feel like I have a higher perception of sound and I am more sensitive to rapid movement. Also, I do feel a greater sense of faith (perhaps because God got me through the trip safely). I didn't feel a great sense of happiness while on acid, but I also didn't feel sad...it was somewhat neutral with perhaps a few new insights. I wouldn't discourage people from trying it as long as you are not stupid about it: I recommend, for your first time, not combining it with any other drugs and making sure you have a house to be in in case you feel like you need to be indoors.", "All in all acid was an enjoyable yet alienating experience.", "I was 16 at the time of this experience. I had my friend Pete over to my house for a night of tripping on acid. In the morning we picked up 2 microdots, which we were told contained 500ug of LSD. This number didn't mean much to us, and we had had previous experiences with a weaker strength of microdot orally. Tonight, we decided that we would like to heighten the trip by insufflating the microdots.", "At 7:00, we each crushed our microdots and got two straws to snort with. We were in my brother's bedroom, both feeling in a positive mood. I went first and snorted my microdot. Instantly, I felt an insane rush of evil come over my body. The taste of the powder was like sucking on a Tylenol and it was dripping down the back of my throat. I suddenly felt like I was going to vomit, so I rushed to the washroom and hovered over the toilet for 5 minutes.", "When I returned to the room, Pete had snorted his and was sitting in the corner grinning mischievously. I laid down on the couch and tried to calm myself. All of a sudden, objects in the room started shifting and walls started breathing. I looked over at a painting on the wall and a light mist in the shape of a person began to shift off the wall.", "At 30 minutes after insufflation, I was getting mad visuals. Textures were infinitely complex and beautiful. The early nausea had faded away, perhaps because I was involved in what was happening around me. I looked over at Pete and he continued to smile and stare at everything he could, trying to absorb all there was around us.", "We never moved from our positions for 4 hours, because the happenings around us were sufficient to more than amuse us for that time. At about 5 hours after ingestion, the visuals began to weaken but were still very nice and slow. At this time, we ventured out of the room we were in and watched the Pantera home video, also snacking on chips and pop, which felt amazing gracing my stomach. By 6 hours after ingestion,", "we were down completely. A beautiful experience except for the first 10 minutes of coming up, which were physically burdening.", "I've recently read about Trey's experience on mixing LSD with mescaline, something about his recollection struck me as to how similar it was to mine, only I had just taken LSD alone.  One afternoon myself and a close friend did some acid, and experienced the usual tale of warped images, however approx 6 hours later when I thought that the effects were begining to dissipate, I was astounded to see something which was amazing and uncontrollable - and ultimately emotionally stunning. No matter how much I tried to change my focus on to something else, the things I were seeing remained.  These things or thing, was in fact a jelly like sheen which coated my whole body, which I could only detect by sight (at first).  It looked like what I imagine a drop of milk would look like suspended in geletine, sort of forming a minute yet complex white misty cloud, it hovered about an inch above my skin (not my clothes)  As I began to explore this occurence more closely - by looking at my fingers, I saw fleeting electrical sparks, the smallest I have ever seen, these electrical sparks seemed to be thinner than the finest hair and lasting only a fraction of a fraction of a second.  ", "I later began to feel a strong electrical presence in the room (no sound) just a kind of what I would describe as a 'biological white noise' This white noise grew immense and loud - this is not auditory loud, it's more of a loud silence, maybe the opposite of sound?  anyway, I felt it engulf me and take me to the most euphoric place I have ever been, I sensed that this place was unlike the 3 dimensional life that I knew of, but more of a place where everying is purely emotional - purely thought - no mass no space.  Whilst in this place, I was convinced that the other presence formed part of me, and alway had been with me. Like Trey I felt that this presence was happy to know that I could finally acknowledge it.", "I had always heard people say that LSD often times leads to life changing experiences or profound prophecies, but I never believed them.  I was one of those 'hey dude lets take acid for some cool visuals' kind of tripper.  I would take as many hits as I was dared to just because I thought I was the king of LSD.  All of this changed, however, when I had a true LSD experience.", "   I was thrilled when my girlfriend came home with a vial one Tuesday.  Even though I had classes the next day I was eager to try out the new stuff.  I took pride in the fact that I was always the guinea pig, for the first trip out of the vial was always free.  After she distributed all of the liquid onto sweet tarts, I took 4 of them plus the extra half hit that was in the vile.  My friend who had never tripped before took two hits, and we waited like we were little boys eager to find the toy in our Happy Meals.  I told him him not to ever panic, that it was only a drug.  Irony, however, would bite me on the ass in the end.", "   The first four hours of the trip were very normal.  When it kicked in, I turned on some Aphrodite and danced to satisfy my increasing energy.  The visuals kicked in very soon and I took my friend to the woods for a hike.  I knew this was some good stuff and my journey had officially begun.  We had a lot of fun and upon returning 5 hours later I was drained (I was still tripping very hard at this point).  This is where the unexplainable happens.", "   For some reason, before we even stepped foot into the apartment, I wanted to see my girlfriend really bad.  I felt a strong emotional attachment like I had never felt before.  It was like I loved her more than ever.  When I finally got inside she was off to bed (she didn't trip) and I followed her even though I was still very much out of it.  When I got into bed and shut the lights out, my life would forever be changed.", "   I immediately had an out of body experience.  It was as though I was dead and I was watching myself screw up in life through these unusual 'scenes'.  I literally saw myself partying and failing out of school.  I also saw myself not paying much attention to my girlfriend which would lead to a break up.  I saw myself taking the wrong paths but I couldn't tell myself I was taking it.  I screamed and yelled, but 'he' kept on going anyway.  All at once I realized that I was 'he', and that I did have control of my life.  I came to a realization that these prophecies could come true if I didn't change.  ", "   I got out of bed to go and talk with my friend to see if anything unordinary had happened to him.  Right when I got to his place, however, I suddenly became fearful.  I couldn't say an intelligent sentence if my life depended in on it.  I felt as though I was on the brink of insanity.  Had I taken too many drugs and now my brain was fucked up?  Was it too late to change my life for the better?  Was I doomed?  Ironically, my rookie friend talked me out of my fears.  Acid had put me in my place.  'It' grabbed my ego from deep within my soul and threw it away forever.  I realized I never had control of acid, rather it had control of me.", "   Although some would say I had a 'bad trip', I look at it as the best trip of my life.  My GPA drastically improved in one semester and my girlfriend and I are happier than ever.  I also realized LSD probably isn't good to do every week, but doing it every once in a while is good to gain some insight into your life.  You just have to be open to what you learn.", "This was one fo my first experiences with the drug and by far one of my fondest, if only for the variation in moods and thoughts and how I was able to cope.", "The incident happened in 1993 at a MegaDog gig in London.  Similar to a rave but more trancy tribal music and with better visuals.", "We (my friend and his girlfriend) had purchased our tickets the day prior to the gig and had spent the rest of the time what gear to take and use.  George (as he shall be called) had already gone to Amsterdam and obtained a thousand 'groucho marx' (rectangular tabs) and was hiding them from his mum in his computer.", "A few hours before entrance we had gone to a couple of pubs and had some alchohol (I've never seen too much of a hazard of mixing small amounts of drink with other drugs) and managed to have ourselves a bit of a smoke.  I had to smoke via a pipe coz I can't stand tobacco so I'm Mr Neat.  George prefers Skunk so Skunk it was.  ", "By the time we arrived at the que for the gig we were feeling mellow but happily nervous with anticipation.  We didn't even take much heed to the intensity of the cold of the night (November).", "After the obligatory hands-up-search-for-anything type affair at the door and then sorting coats and tickets out we all went off to check out the venue.  We'd been there before but its always the thing to do.  The music was already thumping from various rooms and there was the feeling of adrenalin in the air.  The main arena was warming up with the likes of Astralasia with deep base sounds that reverberated around the walls and straight through you.  That was good in itself.", "Soon afterwards we met up again and decided that we would take just half of a trip for now.  Because half was the size of a normal one I knew at some point I was going to come up pretty hard.  One by one we filed off to the loos and dropped our gear.  ", "I ALWAYS have a nauseous feeling when I swallow the tab.  I think its due to the anticipated nausea that some of us get when coming up.  So after swallowing I did the innevitable body shiver with a screwed up face and went to the bar to get some water.", "The next forty five minutes or so we spent leaning against the wall nodding our heads to the music and occasionally taking swigs of water.  We all do it!  I think I was the last to come up and when that happens you automatically think you've got a dud.  But low and behold I remember the first twinge of slight sickness.  It made me shift my position and then I felt the warm sensation in my stomach.  this made me breath in deep and I felt my cheeks redden.  Loverly!  The smile stretched across my face and I just let it take control.", "It came in waves and eventually remained a constant.  My weight was lifted and I felt light as a feather.  Goose bumps flittered up and down my arms as I felt the steady thump of the base pulsating through my body.  Ten minutes later and I couldn't resist the urge to dance and I was off!  Eventually I was at the front of the crowd near the speakers and the stage where the djs were and loving it.", "Every now and then I would come off for a breather.  Sometimes I found George and his girlfriend sitting down with huge grins on their faces.  We would exchange slow nods and smiles (all that's needed) and do our own thing.  I remember that when I danced my arms and hands seemed to move in a slow motion with my eyes and head following their movement.  It seemed much slower than the music was going but I seemed to be hitting the beat every time.", "A couple of hours later and I was absolutely caned - I was sweating buckets and could hardly speak.  I would walk through the crowds as if drifing or floating and the people would just melt out of the way.  There were no sudden movements from me - well of course not, I could predict the entire movements of everyone in the building and new exactly when to turn or glide this way and that.  I was dancing a routine through the crowd that had been pre-written for me - it was fantastic.", "The first hallucination I had was when I entered one of the chill out bars.  The very first thing I saw was the stone slabs that they used for the floor.  Then I saw the some grungy people with green army coats in the corner and then a spilt drink to my right.  It was dark here and quite crowded.  In that split second my brain had already made up its mind on where it thought it was.  Quickly the bar melted and revealed the dungeon that I was really in.  I moved slowly through looking at the dripping water and the rats that scurried out of my way.  Prisoners of some other era lay dormant in their green macs in the corners.  The stone walls had green alghi and other damp patches everywhere.  I had to shake my head before the bar materiallised.  'For gods sake' I reminded myself, 'its a fucking bar'.  As I ordered another bottle of water the images kept repeating.  I didn't panic though - it was interesting and I remember thinking how it could happen that anyone could possibly get from a bar to a dungeon cell.", "Later I bumped into another friend who was smoking some skunk as he always did.  He seemed able to talk fine and was asking me various polite questions.  Unfortunately,  with every word he spoke I was thinking of a thousand answers and when I eventually opened my mouth to speak, a million words tried to form but ended up in alot of giberish and a few audible 'erms' and 'ums'.  This worried me a little as I was becoming increasingly aware that he could tell I was off my rocker.  I had to control the panic welming inside.  Was he looking at me strangely?  Was he giving subtle hand signals to others to suggest I was stupid? Was the group over there giggling at what I was doing, or wearing - or NOT wearing?  I looked down to check if I my trousers had disappeared.  Again, I had to shake my head.  No-one was taking the piss out of me so calm down!", "I met with George who asked if I wanted to up to the balcony to calm down.  I nodded and followed like a zombie.  I passed a couple of people collecting for children in need who collered me for money - I think I gave them a fiver - they knew I was totalled and slapped a sticker on my chest.  I remember they made it cover the face of mona lisa I had printed with fractals and a spliff.  They thought it was funny.  I just wanted to get away from their voices that were changing pitch from high to low and back again.", "Upstairs everyone was lying or sitting down.  I had to pick my way through all the bodies and sit down.  We sat for a while and I was able to cool down a bit.  Someone tapped me twice on the shoulder.  I looked round but noone was even near me.  I freaked!  I wasn't bolloxed enough that I couldn't mistake that tap.  And I sure as hell knew that no-one was near me.  'What's up?'  George asked.  'blddysbbbllblbl...um'  I replied in good effort and then pointed to my sticker on my chest.  It had gone!  Oh my god, had the mysterious tapper pinched it or had I imagined those people downstairs?  I hadn't imagined the fiver that was for sure.  Panic was on its way back again. ", "I got up and decided to go back for a dance - yeh dancing would get my head back to noddy land.  within a few minutes I was leaping around madly fallowing the green and red fractal designs that my hands were making whilst courting with the flashing lights.", "Now, George had warned me previously about some type of Ether that companies were putting into their smoke machine during these times.  He'd said it was like Amyl Nitrite in that it brought everyone up in seconds without them knowing and then they'd have a really ace time and tell all their friends about the gig - thus more gigs.  He also said that it had a habit of multiplying the effects of any substances that you were on by about four times.  Looking back I think it was some urban rumours that were going around - but I still think about it.  Anyway, I remember at one point (when Eat Static were playing) at a crux of a tune the smoke machine let out loads and ingulfed everyone.  In the next few seconds I watched as if not part of my body, as EVERYONE became one moving body.  Their eyes all widened and searching forwards.  it was like a huge wave of bodies all under one control.  Then, all of a sudden I felt my left upper leg lock in intense cramp.  I dropped like a sack of spuds and then really panicked.  No-one had even noticed I was writhing in agony!  If anything, they all seemed to just dance on me.  I picked a direction and crawled through the feet of the possessed crowd until I came to a door.  Stumbling through I was in a corridor and managed to slump myself down on a chair.  ", "Whilst massaging my leg I remember that my leg was starting to fade in green and red fractals and the floor was alive with sparks of these patterns.  All I could think was 'oh for gods sake not now'  I didn't panic then and was more pissed of that I couldn't benefit the picture because of the cramp.  A girl materialised with a glass of water-'...just as you asked-'  I smiled and wondered when I had asked her.", "The pain subsided and I calmed down and I sat back and watched the patterns for a while.  Green and red sparkes were shooting across the floor and all over my hands.  The walls were pulsating and shifting colours and the music was altering its pitch chaotically.  Sitting there I could at last appreciate it for what it was and desperately wanted to work out how it happens.  At that point George came through the door with his girlfriend and they didn't look to pleased.  They asked it I'd noticed the change on the dance floor and George kept on saying about the Ether.  We all agreed to go outside into a square that was part of the building's grounds.  Here we were able to cool down.  I didn't bother speaking but just listend to the whispers of other conversations all around me.  The sound was like the noise of the sea genlty rolling on a shingle beach.", "Soon we decided to leave.  I had to be led as I could no longer steer myself in the mathematical fashion I had done before.  I remember walking onto the street and seeing the cars.  The tracers that the cars left behind made it seem as if they were moving at high speed.  Watching them it seemed like they were moving at one mile and hour.  The noise was jingle jangle of squeaks and mumbles.  Getting a cab was the funniest part as neither of us was in any decent enough position to speak properly and we had to enter an office to order it.  It seemed like it took twenty minutes to get the words out and then we were in the car-I was sitting in the front.  ", "In London the all night cabs are driven by dodgy people with their own cars.  It suddenly dawned on me that we could be taken advantage of here.  None of us would be able to put up a struggle.  I didn't even know where the hell I was let alone put my fists up.  My door was opened and a man started shouting.  This was it, I thought.  We're gonna get mugged and I'm supposed to be the tougher one.  I started laughing.  As it turned out the guy thought our driver was taking his fare.  A few seconds later and we were off.  We stopped under a bridge briefly so that I could be sick out of the car.  George was putting it down to the effects of the Ether - again.", "When we got back I got the cramps again and George's girlfriend got me some salt/sugared water which worked a treat (strongly suggest it for dehydration) and I lay there quietly tripping and slowly coming down.", "With no sleep, I was up and had left by six thirty in the morning.  I had to travel the underground to Victoria and then down to Brighton (about sixty miles) to work.  Needless to say I was completey plastered and still a little bit tripping.  My boss was not amused.", "That's it.  It was, looking back on it a great time and well worth it.  For since then I have been able to work out my own personal dosage and have developed a good understanding of hallucinations and what to expect.  If ever I take trips now its usually about a quater of a tab at a time.", "One good thing about trips is the ability for hand-eye co-ordination.  I have learnt some of my best tricks whilst tripping.", "Back in the spring of '90, I was attending Drexel University in Philadelphia , and my roommate and I decided to drop, along with a few buddies who lived up the hall from us. (This during a period of my life where I had just finished having a slew of, not bad, but rather unpleasant trips) This was my roommate's second trip, my 100th? (lost count) Anyway, we were engaged in wide and diverse activities, like staying in our dorm room and watching TV to the music of Floyd . Anyway, my roommate and I got antsy and left in his car. He felt fine to drive a short distance, he said, so we drove to Fairmont Park. Now, this was about 3 hours into the trip or so, and around 1:00 in the morning. Anyway, the two buddies had headed to Fairmont Park, and we looked for them. Feeling *really* paranoid, because of some shifty characters parked next to our car who kept staring at us. I'm not rascist, but perhaps they were, and they were black, I'm white. ", "Anyway, we left our cars, and climbed a rock formation which has a car underpass under it, and overlooks the river. The lights reflected off the water twinkling with the currents, providing some real good eye candy. Anyway, we sat up there and smoked a bowl or two, and were watching the night sky, wondering where our buddies were, (and I was paranoid about getting mugged, even though we had gone there a lot before) when we noticed what the clouds were doing. Even though it was dark out, we could see the clouds and they were forming right before our eyes. I have seen this once before straight, but it was nothing like this...on acid, they kept forming cartoony shapes, like the Escher dragons biti ng each other's tails, etc., etc. Extremely intense. ", "Anyway, my roommate asked me what I saw, and what I described to him (as it was happening) was exactly what he saw. That made it really cool. So he then described what he was seeing, as it occurred, and I was delighted to find that I *was* seeing what he saw, bu t it was not suggestion, because I knew what I saw before he described it. All in all a really weird experience, but I guess you had to be there. Anybody who' s tripped before should be able to relate to it.", "Anyway, later on that night, back at the dorm, our buddies met up with us, and they related to us quite a story. They had gone to Fairmont Park, but further upriver. They had had beer with them, too. (Don't know why--alcohol is a waste of time on LSD) So they were feeling esp. paranoid when a cop car drove by once on the highway with its lights on, then circled back, because he had seen them, and parked and came over to them. They hid their pot and beer real quick and *tryed* to sober up. Anyway, the cop asked them if they had seen anyone suspicious because someone further along the river had been stabbed earlier by a black man. The real kicker on this story is that two black guys had been in the same area as my friends, but when the cop car pulled up, one hid under a car, and another ran into the woods. AND they had come from the same direction that the cop had said the incident occurred. The cop suggested rather strongly that my buddies should leave the park, and this was one incident where my friends felt that a cop's advice meant something.", "I had always been comfortable in my experiences.  Never had a thought of a bad time, or extreme insanity ever crossed my mind.  I started tripping at the beginning of my Junior year in college, I guess because I was bored with life.  My creativity had run out, and LSD seemed to be a way in which I could channel that creativity.  But nothing, nothing could have ever prepared me for the night of April 11.", "On the day before that life changing event, I had decided to roll for the very first time, which was wonderful.  The next night I had decided to go on the trip of my life at a party that I was having.  I started the night off by eating two of these Jellies (orange if I am not mistaken) and had grown impatient for the trip to come on.  So I quickly ate another jelly, then in which my friend dared me to eat another.  So I did.  I mean young male pride was ripe, and I did not bother to give it a second thought.  My other friend (you could call her the supplier of such party favors) said she had a jelly and a half left.  So I bought those and ate them as well.  Thats when I started to trip. Hard.", "The world began to glow red, sepping across and stretching into everything imaginable.  With the redness of the world and myself, things began to get very warm.  So I decided to go to my room and lock the door.  I didn't realize it yet, but the night had not even started.  I began to have horrific thoughts of having eaten too much LSD.  Perhaps my heart was about to explode, I don't know.  But death, death was on my mind.  I let some friends into the room and that is when the insanity hit.", "I sat Indian style in the corner of the room and it bagan to disappear.  The world diasappeared in a series of flashes and I blacked out for a moment.  I came to and realized that I was stuck in time.  Stuck, a second was infinity and infinity was not long enough.  Every move I made, every breath I took lasted forever.  It was hell.", "I rolled over in my bed and my sheets wrapped around me, forming a rock tight caccoon.  The world was gone and all I could see was a huge heart.  It was my heart and it exploded.  I was dead, dead as a rock and realized that the bed opened and my mind had left my body, as I fell through space.  I saw the stars, the moon, planets, the universe.  I had given up on life, nothing mattered when you were dead, but I couldn't accept it.  I couldn't.", "Suddenly I found myself leaping down several staircases, a flight at a time.  I quickly made it outside with my roommate at least thirty seconds behind.  I was holding my head screaming over and over that I had died, and was entirely convinced.  I did not want to accept it, and it is that fact that kept me going.  I undressed in the road, as clothes had no meaning to a wanderless spirit of the night. That is when my roommate caught up with me and attempted to explain to me what was happening.  I was insane.  But his voice was nothing in comparison to the voice from above.  God's echoing voice covered all, and I was powerless to resist it.  It told me one thing (that phrase which if repeated, might get me a lighting bolt from above.)  That is when I ran and the dirt path in front of me became a stairway to heaven and in the clouds above I could see a white light.  The white light.  I went as high as I could and just as I put my finger to that light, my mind shut down.", "I eventually awoke in my friend's car, stark naked, and vomit all over myself.  The world was different, I was different, and I don't think that my life can ever be like that hollowed shell again. This will probably be the most spiritual experience of my life.", "I spent the next year of my life, depressed and sometimes on the edge of lunacy.  But I have finally recovered, as the events of that night are slowly fading in with my memory.  But I talked to God (or the voice in my Sub-concious, however you want to see it), learned a fundamental truth, touched the light at the end of the tunnel, and realized that I was alive.  Truly alive.  Life is beatiful, glorious, and is never to be wasted.", "About a month ago, I went to a folk festival with my family and my boyfriend. I've been wanting to try acid for a long time; me and my boyfriend have been trying to get a hold of it for months. He's done it before, and said it is the best drug out there. Well finally we acquired 6 hits- on marshmallows- from a kid in school (we're still in high school, 17 years old). I decided to take one, he would take two, and then we'd save the rest. So we brought it to the campground with us, and were planning on taking it on Friday night, when all the good bands were playing. ", "We ate a little dinner, and took a walk up the street at about 6:30 and ate one marshmallow each. About five minutes later, I could already feel the effects. (Tip: before you do a more serious mind-altering drug like LSD, I recommend trying some other psychedelics before - I've experimented with mushrooms, DXM, and morning glory seeds. This way you'll get a familiar feeling when you trip. This is important so you know what to expect and you don't freak out). It was the usual light-headed, almost drunk feeling. We wandered around for about 45 minutes, but nothing really progressed for either of us- the same feeling as before. So we decided to eat another one each. So it was then 7:15, and I had taken two hits, and he had three. ", "My little sister was tagging along that night: as most 13 year olds, she was being really annoying, and my boyfriend John* was getting nervous. He knew that she'd bug him out. (Setting is very important- only choose to be around people who you trust, and people who will make you feel relaxed and calm in this type of situation). So after about 30 more minutes of hearing my little sister beg us for a hit, we gave it to her. (Bad Idea #1- we knew she wouldn't be able to handle it, even though she's experimented with alcohol and marijuana before). ", "So at 7:45, an hour and fifteen minutes after Hit #1, and 30 minutes since Hit #2, we went down to the field to watch the show. At that time, I was feeling extremely intoxicated. I expected it to be more like being high on weed- but it was definitely like being drunk, or a strong DXM trip. It was getting dark, and I was getting confused (Setting again- be comfortable where you are taking this drug, don't take it in an unfamiliar scene). We made it down to the field, and chilled in the back, where we knew my parents wouldn't find us (Bad Idea #2- taking LSD around parents). ", "These little kids had glow necklaces and were throwing them in the air. It looked so awesome- the patterns and the trails had begun. I sent my little sister over to a vendor and she bought three. We were just laying there on the ground, swinging them around- it was like being at a laser light show. It was 8:15- I was feeling really good, smiling, and thinking 'this is why I'm alive'. Then, John's attitude started to change. It was really cold out- but he was like, rocking back and forth, sweating. I was trying to tell him how cool everything was- we were in a different world, people were walking by in slow motion, there were patterns everywhere, and everything was alive. But whenever I opened my mouth, he'd tell me to shut up. ", "I was getting scared, because I was afraid that he was gonna have a bad trip- he kept repeating 'I'm never doing this again...this was a bad idea...I wish this would stop'. Then I started thinking these ideas. This dude walked up and asked me something, I answered him back, and when he walked away I realized it was my dad. It was about 9:30. My little sister was chewing on her long sleeved shirt- it was soaked. She looked insane-you couldn't see her blue eyes- only huge pupils, and she looked like a rabid dog. My boyfriend was laying on the ground, with his eyes covered, shaking. I was getting really scared for him. I was trying to calm him down. ", "Eventually, the concert ended, and it was about 11:30- but it felt like we were there for a couple days. My trip was starting to go bad, between my little sister and John,  my mind began to race- when is this gonna end? what time is it? what happens when my parents come up? everyone around us knows! what if a dog attacks me? Well my parents found us again, and we tried to act normal, but my little sister kept saying that she was having so much fun, and I knew we were being shady. We walked up the hill to the campsite, which seemed to take forever, and my parents stopped and gave us the camper key, because they were gonna stop by the bathroom. My dad handed it to me and said 'it's the perforated one'. But aren't all keys perforated? It seemed like everyone else were the ones who were messed up, not us! ", "Well, we got lost on the way back to the camper. My parents were there before us, and they kept asking us where we were. We were freaking out, because it only seemed like we were lost for 5 minutes- but on acid, your timing is messed up- in reality it could've been 2 hours. We walked into the camper and we started to get ready for bed. There was no way I couldn't changed my clothes, or washed my face or brushed my teeth. I was sitting on my bed, and John was looming over me, and I kept asking him where we were and what we were doing in my camper, and when are we going home? (Another good reason to be in a comfortable situation). We climbed into bed, and my dad was outside listening to trance music. Not tonight! we thought. It was one o' clock,I had been tripping for about 6 hours, and it didn't seem like it was going to stop. I shut my eyes, but the trance music was causing some crazy closed-eye visuals. ", "Then my mind lapsed to a book I had been reading about the Vietnam war. I started freaking out because I thought the Congs were going to come and shoot my family. I was hiding under my sheets, sweating, and I realized something was really uncomfortable in my mouth. I was chewing gum. It was dark in the camper, my parents had already gone to be (2 am) and I reached into my mouth to get the gum out. Well I went to throw it in the trash can next to me, and it wouldn't get off my finger! I took my other hand and tried to pull it off, but it was stuck between my hands then. I kept trying to get it off, and I was getting incredibly afraid that it would end up on my face or in my hair, and I started crying, and I jumped up out of bed. My mom looked over and was like, what's the matter! So I told her that I had gum stuck on my hands. She helped me get it off, and was giving me wierd looks (because I still had my clothes and makeup on). ", "I was getting back into bed, and I looked on the top bunk and John was there, wrapped up in his sheets, staring at me, and completely sweaty. I kissed him and went back into my bed. The rest of the night was full of unwelcomed and sometimes scary patterns on the wooden walls, and wierd noises. Finally I heard the alarm clock go off: it was 6 a.m., and time for John to drive me back home to get ready for work. We went to the Wawa down the road, looking like serious crap. I walked in, and this guy in front of me in line had a huge orange spider crawling up his back. I was so frightened and disturbed that I almost started screaming, and when I paid and left, I walked out and told John. ", "We then figured out that we were still trippin. John admitted that he took too much, and he was on the border of having a really bad trip. The three of us drove home, in the fog, and I got in the shower (which was really strange) and put on my makeup and left for work. I was at work, and still tripping till about 10 a.m. ", "1) Setting is very important- make it a comfortable and familiar place, with trusting people. ", "2) always test the substance out for strength before you use it. ", "3) make sure you don't have to do anything serious the next day. ", "We decided that we would try this again in the future, but only 1 hit each, and during the day, so it won't disturb our sleep so much. Overall, it was a beautiful experience, but you just have to be very prepared and careful.", "Well, my first mistake was that this, my first trip, was also my first time doing anything.  I was 17, and I've been a relatively 'straight kid' for most of my life, I mean I had only been drunk once.  Anyways, I had never quite been against drugs, and thought it would be neat to try one that would give me a definite, memorable experience.  So, a couple newer friends of mine asked if I wanted to trip, so I accepted.  I took one hit, and my friends each took two.", "All was well when it just started to kick in, extreme happiness, a body buzz.. I couldn't stop smiling and laughing.  Then, just as things started getting a bit overwhelming, my friends' parents came home.  So, we had to go out walking around a very busy part of town.  During our walk, we were especially out of it because 1) the acid we took was unusually strong and we were peaking 2) we were in a very uncomfortable, transient environment and 3) because we had no one to calm us down.  To make matters worse, a  guy came up to me, and asked me for my number, and then if I had any cocaine.  This, was particularly unpleasant, as I didn't want to be asked any questions, and I was somehow convinced that I might simply have been imagining the walk, and that I was still back at the house.  My friends proceeded to haul me into various stores at which we bought nothing, and I became even more irritated, afraid and paranoid.", "Finally we returned to my friend's house.  That's when we heard Rod Stewart music spewing from outside.  My friends, much more enthusiastic than I at this point, bolted outside to see where it was coming from.  Right then, alone in the room, I felt very overwhelmed, and wanted only to have the trip over with, so much so that I was almost willing to just call my parents and explain everything so that I could get help if possible.  My friends rushed back in, somewhat oblivious to my bad trip, as I was trying very hard not to show it.  Thankfully, my friend sat me down, put on some nice music, and put a magic eye book on my lap, which seemed to calm me down.  After I had come off of my peak, we watched tv, and then played with the snow on the screen.  The rest of the night was wonderful and calm.  So I guess I can say I'm not scared off lsd, but I'd definitely reconsider the environment in which to take it.", "This is something that I have been meaning to write for some time. Back when I used to take LSD, I felt as if I was invincible to this 'bad trip' that people so often spoke of. What is this...bad trip? I knew it not. I was always in complete control of myself. I scoffed at those who encountered mental difficulties with drugs. I was young, naive, and very foolish.", "I would dose ridiculous amounts of LSD, eat a few milligrammes of Xanax, and watch the show for hours on end. One particular night, I didn't get the Xanax, but I'm not sure it would have helped anyway. My friend Ralph had ten hits of the best LSD I have ever seen. He took two, and I took eight. My estimate is 800 microgrammes, based on the idea that each hit had at least 100 microgrammes. (but I really have no idea) You will see why shortly.", "Within fifteen minutes, visuals had started and we were both laughing uncontrollably. After forty-five minutes, neither one of us could see straight in front of us. We could not read or even tell where we were. We were in his apartment at school, but the atmosphere was getting worse by the second. I had just eaten a burrito, and I went to the bathroom and vomited it up. When I looked in the toilet, it appeared to be full of blood. I looked at my arms, and it looked as if all my veins had burst and blood was all around me. I grabbed paper towels and cleaned myself up and headed back to the main room.", "I told my friend that I wanted a cigarette, but he didn't think I should go get them out of my car because we were too screwed up at the time. I thought that he was against me. I figured that he must have been an agent of the DEA or something, so I started asking him his name over and over again. He got extremely frustrated with me and then he soon forgot his name. I thought that this was proof that he was operating undercover with a fake name. I began to ask him if he was a guy, and he replied, 'I hope you don't normally ask people these questions.' I believed that this answer was even more proof of his need to avoid questions to cover his true identity. I began to shout and swear and say very perverse things to him and threaten disgusting sexual acts. I disrobed then almost completely and threw my socks at him. I curled up on the floor and began to say my name over and over again.", "'Letters make up my name. If my name is Raoul, then I am Raoul. That means that I am an R, an A, an O, a U, and an L. But I am clearly not those letters, so I must not be Raoul.'", "'I am Justin Otis. I am Jason Forsberg. I am David Winburn. I am Shane Roth. I am Ryan Gray. I am Loren Cleary.'", "I picked up the phone and dialed a friend and yelled at him for a while, then put my clothes back on.", "I decided that I had to have a cigarette, so I left the apartment, leaving my friend behind. I walked a short distance and saw a picnic table full of people eating hamburgers and ran up to it and jumped on top of the table and screamed, 'I am a lunatic! Do you see people act like this? Ever? Hell no! Because I'm crazy. I'm the freak that your parents warned you about. I am the statistic in your psychology book! Have you ever read 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'? I am Las Vegas!'", "Well, it wasn't long before somebody called the cops and an undercover cop showed up and she pretended to want to help me. She found my pager in a pile of clothes of mine and asked what numbers were on there. I didn't know, so I told her to call them. I was on a college campus, where they had speaker call boxes at the bottom of the apartments. She called a few numbers, but got no answer. Then, the unthinkable happened. She saw the phone number of Maria, a girl who worked with me whom I had dated a few times previously. The cop called her and Maria answered. I heard her voice on the speaker phone and immediately became very embarrassed. The cop said, 'Hello. Do you know anybody named Raoul who would have your number on his pager?'", "She replied that she did and that I worked with her. I walked up to the phone and yelled, 'Maria!'", "The cop ended the phone conversation. She then led me to sit down and put on my shirt and shoes. I was starting to calm down very noticeably, and I started rambling on a bunch of nonsense about the way the universe works. I understood the cosmic nature of all actions and perceived that I had become one with Fate - a sense of eternal predestination. It was as if I understood that what was happening was preordained and that it was my destiny that night to die - even if I had to do it myself. The cop told me that I would not kill myself and that everything would be fine.", "Then the boys in blue showed up. Six squad cars in all, and the drug task force. I thought that media cameras were there and I remember thinking that helicopters were flying around. I walked up to the police officers and threw myself at the ground and asked them to take me away. For it was tonight that I was to be executed for horrendous behaviour. They told me to get up and sit down. I did.", "'I took eight hits of the dankest acid you have ever seen - and now I'm a lunatic. I'm going to die.'", "Then the fun started when one officer piped up and asked, 'Do you have any more on you?'", "'What? You want to know if I have more? Here I am a total insane freak and you want to bust me with drugs? So you can get that big promotion? You profit-motivated swine! There is more here at stake than a bust! You want money? You can have mine! I have $187 here for you - take it!'", "Silence from the police officers. Then, 'Well, who did you get it from?'", "'What? Here we are again - back to busting people and making money off of my lunacy! You pigs make me sick!'", "Then an officer said, 'Well, you might think differently when you sober up...'", "Sober up? Sobriety? What's that? I had no concept of rationality or straight thinking. As far as I was concerned I was doomed for life in this semi-functional, yet fully-enlightened state.", "Finally, one cop said to another, 'Call this guy a cab...'", "They called a cab, gave me back my belongings and after spouting off nonsense for about thirty minutes, I got into the long awaited taxi and went home, and lay in bed all night thinking about what a fool I had been the previous night.", "That night and my repulsive behaviour still haunts me to this day. I really don't do very many drugs anyway, but LSD is one that I will not ever touch ever again. Please be careful with LSD. I think it is highly unstable and can make you do or think things that you might have never before conceived of. I still shudder when I think of the things I said and did, and the damage that I did to friendships and relationships. Some have not healed yet - and that is a price I have to pay.", "I was with 5 other friends at a house. I had to have dinner with my mum while the others dropped, and I got to them about 2 hours after they had all dropped. We stayed at the house for about 1/2 - 1 hour, when it was decided that me and Richo would go and score some pot. ", "Well we both got in the car and set off... the drive there was cool, there was this white shimmering, and the vibrations from the car made me feel mellow and the music was trippy . Well we got to this guys house, scored the weed and decided to have a few cones. It would have been 2 hours after I dropped then. Well I had one cone, and then in the space of a few minutes I lost it. The curtains were swaying in the breeze, but it felt like the walls where breathing. The funny thing was that as the outside world moved, I could feel it on my body. Well the bad part was where I had dinner and it never really digested properly. So it felt like I had this lump in my stomach. It hurts. And when I focused on it, it was like these memories of my child-hood came back to me.... all of a sudden, with my eyes wide open, I was with all the people in my primary school class outside on the grass.", "Well it kept getting more intense.... our other friends rang us up wondering where the pot was. I told Richo that I simply couldn't drive. I was sitting completely still on a bench and I didn't think I could even get up. After a while the space at the edge of my vision lost all colour and form, until I was looking at everything through a window. I closed my eyes.... and I just went off into this space.... hmm. The pain in my stomach was still there.... this guy whose house it was decided to mull up some more cones. It was so funny.... It felt like my pain was the mull.... as he started mullin' it eased and fell through.... but then his mullie got stuck and he goes... 'almost...' and the pain came back. ", "Well eventually the guy said that he would like us to leave. So I managed to stand up and walk outside. We got in the car. Well this guy Richo I was with is an experienced tripper, and me it was my first. So we were sitting in the car in this guys driveway, and he was explaining how I could  feel other people's energies. Well then things got really really bizzarre. It was like in the car the future and the past didn't exist. I was having difficulties coping with my reality, and Richo was explaining to me how the universe worked. After about half an hour he reminded me we where in some guys driveway still. Well I was trippin out exploring my pain, and I just wondered why I should bother going back to my frinds and stuff, why I shouldn't just curl up and trip out. It took Richo about another hour to finally get me to move. It was like I realised that I had no direction in life. I got down to the root of existence, and I found my yin/yang energies.... and one side of my body felt good, and one bad. Somehow I just realised that I needed to just follow the good feeling.... I needed to control the drug, not let the drug control me. And it snapped, that I needed to control my life, not let life control me. And when I did that I pulled myself out of my sorry and depressed state, and became chuffed, inspirational etc. ", "The drive home was way cool, we were just floating in a sea of lights with errie jungle music going... and I realised that I was almost out of petrol. So we had to go to a BP. Man, the BP. I have never been anywhere so trippy in my life. We spent another half hour sitting in the car, in which time we went into a world that was sooo like the matrix it made me wonder what those guys where on. Any thoughts I had would come true, and with us both there we could go anywhere, do anything.... go on any trip. But anyway, when I went to fill up the car, it was like I was filling myself up. Of course I chose super unleaded, the 'super juice'. Well lots more trips at the BP, like people looking at us funny cause we were so out of it.", "But anyways, we finally found our friends, and it was so wierd. It was like I realised why each one of them was in my life, why our karma had crossed.  I realised that I could change all my friends and everything, just by changing myself from that bad energy to the good stuff. I went outside with one friend to get some music from the car, and on the way back I thought I was holding my friends leg inside my body. When I looked down it was just my bag. Hmm... at one stage I felt myself intertwine with Richo. It was like we were merging our consciousness.... he said that we are our own beings, and we should keep to ourselves... and I realised that how by not being myself, as people always tell you to be, I was allowing other peoples energies to mingle with mine, and I would become them in some way. ", "Well things got a bit stupid cause basically I became stuck somewhere in my mind, and I cound't keep in the present.  But the pain was still there..... eventually I curled up on the floor... and eventually I threw up on the floor :) it made me feel a bit better. Eventually I got to the couch where I went to sleep. I woke up in the morning feeling like I had just figured out how the universe works, which of course I had always wanted to know. I also felt like I had explored my pain sufficiently that it would go away afterwards.", "I have been doing LSD for 3 years now and I thought I could take it up to the next level.  I had some money saved and wanted to purchase some Gel tabs, which in my opinion were always stronger.  It was Friday afternoon and I was getting a ride from my friend to his house.  I popped all 8 in my mouth and let them melt.  I was hanging at his house for about 15 minutes and we were discussing what we were going to do that night.", "We hung around for about 45 minutes listening to music and I had to go to the bathroom.  As I opened the door the inside of the room seemed to bend inward, as if being sucked by a Vacuum,  I knew that the LSD was taking effect.  I was standing up to go pee, and as I watched the water it would lift up and little animal figures would appear out of my urine.  I was facinated by this and stood for about 10 minutes staring into the bowl.  As I turned around for the door it appeared as if a man was stuck in the door and his figure was inside, I reached for the door but my hand was some sort of crab claw, I could open and close the pincers as if they were my own.  After much effort, I opened the door and walked out to what appeared to be a whole new dimension, I could not recognize anything around me, all the walls were mirrors, and each mirror had a different reflection of me, one I was a wasp, and the other a flower.  I saw my friend siting on the couch drinking a beer, and as he spoke the words were slow and garbled.  I was extremly confused. He turned around and there was his melting face, totally unidentifiable, his eyes were near his chin and his mouth was up at his forehead with multicolored teeth.  ", "I wanted to sit down but I couldn't find the couch, all I saw was a woman laying down and rods coming from her chest which seemed to transform into the outline of a couch.  I swung my arm in front of my face and the atmosphere appeared to be torn apart, all objects infront of me were dismembered and only a swirling blackness lay behind them.  I could tell my friend was asking me something but I couldnt possibly try and comprehend any of his words, I couldnt even tell if it was him.  I went back into the bathroom a little frightened and closed the door to wash my face.  I was trying to think what was happening, but it was if my mind was not being used, and I was thinking through someone others head.  As if I havent used my brain before and I am just getting used to it.  As I glanced up I noticed my face was covered in hair and my eyes had tiny arms coming out of them that were stretching towards the mirror.  A vortex like doughnut appeared in the center of the mirror and my face became extended outward and was sucked into the mirror.  As I looked over into the vanity mirror I had no face, there was just a Piece of skin and one bulging eye.  ", "I ran out the door and jumped onto the couch and layed with my eyes closed.  I yelled out to my friend that I needed a nap but I didnt hear a response.  It appeared there were Millions of Pot leafs in a Kalidascope form, with colors I have never seen before covering every square inch of each leaf.  I tried to close my eyes as tight as possibe and the colors just got more intence.  I could feel my heart beating like never before, with each beat there was a red glow around everything.  I layed down and tried to dissect this amazing trip.  Then I heard music, I opened my eyes and everything appeared normal, I saw a few more people just wandering around as if I wasnt there.  I got up and walked around, feeling fine, I looked at the clock and realized it was 11:30  Allthough it was a short lasted trip, it was one that I would not forget.", "I had recently been reading about LSD in books and on the internet and whatnot and I had been really thinking about doing it. During the week at school, my friends had told me that they were getting some sugar cubes for the weekend so they could candy-flip. I had done ecstasy before and had a good experience, but I didn't feel the need to candy flip, I just wanted to purely experience the acid. Friday came around, my friend's parents were gone on vacation in Mexico for the week so we had an open house for about the six of us to just chill. It was a good setting to be at and I was in a good relaxed mood. ", "I decided to take my cube at 8 p.m. I just sat around watching television and talking to friends, waiting anxiously for it to kick in. It was my first time with LSD so I wasn't really sure what to expect. I had read many things about people having bad trips so I was a bit scared of that, but I had to just sit back and wait. Once 9 o'clock came around, things began feeling different. Colors seemed brighter and so did lights and especially bright neon colors just seemed to stick out more and amuse me. I sat at my friend's table in his kitchen, just staring at it, looking at the woodgrain which seemed to stick out alot. At times the woodgrain even seemed to wave a little and I was moving my hands over the grain, wiggling them very fast, amused with them. ", "At about an hour and a half into it, we went in his basement and turned off the lights and put a Winamp visualization on the computer screen. It created all kinds of colors on there which we looked upon, telling each other what we saw. As my friend began mentioning Simpsons characters, I could just look into the screen and see the character he mentioned. I sat on a couch across from the computer and just stared at the ceiling for a while which was very entertaining, the patterning of it, the colors from the computer screen hitting it was unbelieveable at the time. After staring at the ceiling for quite some time, I went upstairs and looked out the window. It was a full moon that night and I was staring at his patio furniture which was reflecting the moonlight on it. I started to see the snow outside. It looked like his whole backyard was immersed in a light sheet of snow, and even the trees and his pool cover looked like a shiny sheet of ice with snow all around it. After seeing this, it really set into me that indeed I am on acid and that it is working. ", "For a while after I sat and watched TV. I was so amused with it. A few friends who weren't tripping or on a drug were also with me watching it. I felt compelled to explain to them how great the TV was because you can watch it and on each station you flip to there are so many things to look at and enjoy, especially the stations with nice colors. As it approached 12, a few of my friends left who needed to be home and my friend's sister, whose house we were at, came home. She told him that their uncle was coming here to sleep and this totally freaked him out and the majority of us sleeping there. To avoid having to see his uncle, we all went down to the basement to sleep. ", "While in the basement we just turned on some music and left all the lights off. I had brought my portable cd player with me and I decided I wanted to listen to some of my classic rock cd's I had with me. I put the headphones on and played the song Voodoo Child by Jimi Hendrix and then Darkside of the Moon by Pink Floyd. While in his dark basement, I just closed my eyes and immersed into the music. I let my mind wander to the furthest depths. Its really hard to explain and understand, but I was so far out of my mind while doing this, it was very strange. After the songs, I would have to do a reality check to bring myself back to the real world. This was probably the most interesting part of the acid experience for me. After doing that for a while, my friends who were all candy flipping and me, we stared at the lights on his cd player that seemed to form different shapes and wiggle around. ", "We spent the rest of the night down there in the basement, listening and enjoying all sorts of music and looking at lights on his cd player and computer. Overall I enjoyed the experience, but I don't think it was a high dose of acid judging by the other stories I've read about people seeing walls and objects breathing, patterning of all kinds of objects, and the intense open eye visuals. But the mind confusion and 'out-there'ness of the experience leads me to believe I indeed experienced something. Also I'm really interested if anyone else has had an experience like this, possibly with a sugar cube too. Every story I have read on here has been with blotter or geltabs. Or if someone had a real intense trip with a sugar cube.", "[erowid note: sugar cubes of LSD are simply standard sugar cubes with a drop of 'liquid LSD' (LSD in solution, usually alcohol) on the cube.  Sugar cubes can vary from extremely strong to mild and there's no way to know what strength it is without knowing how strong the drops were that were used on it.]", "-We kept notes the entire night as our experience went on and on.

Stuck in a house full of people tripping, tweaking, rolling, drunk, high and generally burnt out on recreational drug use, I began to feel the effects around 11:45. ", "I began to feel really relaxed and just wanted to be outside. I didn't know why but something was drawing me towards the porch.  As I sat there on the couch, I looked towards the clouds as if they had something to say, but they only revealed a small church on top of a hill that I had never noticed before. Suddenly the whole situation clicked. ", "I first realized my revelation when I saw the light emitting from the church bell at the top of the steeple and how the light faded between the church and our apartment (like 2 miles away). I began to ponder this symbol and it jogged my memory like nothing ever had before. Thinking of my ex girlfriend who had been in town recently, I realized that she was an 'angel' from the church, and was saving us (everyone at the party) from the depths of hell, and no one knew it. To me, hell was our 'friend's' apartment which is coincidentally where we get most of our hard drugs from. Everything fit together, our whole apartment complex was on a downward slant towards hell, and the only way out was for the 'angel' to rescue us. ", "I immediately reported my revelation to my good friends and they thought it was truly remarkable. We then proceeded to go inside and listen to some music with the lights off. Being the biggest led zeppelin fan ever, I requested something off the boxed set and ended up listening to the entire cd. I seemed to understand everything robert plant was saying (misty mountain hop) and really started listening to what each and every word meant. That is when I closed my eyes to see if I was actually tripping out....And boy was I. I started seeing a kalidescope of rainbow colors with robert plant's head on a tv in the center, revolving around an orange sun flashing yellow and white. This was way too much for me to take in so I shifted back over to the music.  I couldn't believe it; stairway to heaven. The whole revelation was crystal clear to me now. My ex, aka the 'angel' was buying us a stairway to heaven, and was guiding us down the road into the promised land. ", "I began to flip out. I thought something was really weird about this, like it was the truth, and there was no way to convince me otherwise. Earlier in the night, we retrieved a psychedelic flower from someone else's apartment and brought it upstairs to the one we were at. It seemed as if the flower was changing colors with the music, and everyone realized it at the same time. It seemed like god was communicating with me through the flower and was telling us the revelation which I had just experienced. This entire event occured while I was peaking. I looked at the flower and it morphed into a fish-like mailbox which I translated as the mouth of god. I figured of course he would have a fish, after all, all live evolved from the sea. It seemed that the flower was actually something owned by god since it possessed colorful symbolic beauty and was communicating to us through stairway to heaven.  I was peaking and decided I was really freaking out, so I made my way back to the porch (2am).", "While out there, I nursed my gallon of water and began to ponder once more. But this time, I felt like all I had just taken in had made me so much more intelligent, that I could hear everything going on inside. Everyone kept saying 'Greg is totally fucked up' and 'is Greg ok?' This was not okay with me. Why couldn't everyone just chill and keep to themselves? I didn't know. But the eerie thing was that I could hear every conversation before it happened and I interpreted it before it even came to someone's mouth. I talked to my good friend and told him I couldn't take this environment and decided to walk home. I lay in the bed, but to my surprise I could still hear every conversation at the apartment a block away. I could hear every single person laughing at the whole situation, what they were saying about me, and what they were going to do. ", "It was like I was on a different plane of reality. I immediately tried to communicate through esp. I visualized everyone sitting around in a group forum, and I was the only one talking. I tried to contact my friend Melissa, and as I contacted her, her body started to materialize in my sheets (still peaking). I could see parts of her and I could feel her legs rising up in my covers. Then about five minutes later, she actually walked in the door.", "For the rest of the night, I was communicating psychically with what I thought was our whole group of friends, but was really only Melissa. I thought everyone could hear me, and since I had the revelation, what I was saying was totally obviously true. Melissa thought I was weird, but for some reason (she was rolling) she could hear and understand what I was talking about and relate to me. It made the whole experience worthwhile to share it with someone who understands. Then I went to sleep and woke up a different man.", "I began experimenting with LSD when I was maybe 14 years old, shortly after I began attending high school.  For the first while everything seemed to be okay.  I had the odd bad trip, but I always chalked it up to not being in a good frame of mind when I first dosed, and anyone who had experience with the drug will know how a bad mood or an undo amount of stress can be magnified exponentially while tripping out.", "When at 15 I left home permanently and moved to the street, the amount of drugs I began abusing became staggering.  At first acid and PCP were my main drugs of choice, although later I moved on to cocaine, meth, heroin and crack.  While I never became overly dependent on any of these drugs (with the exception of heroin, where I had a short-term addiction that lasted approximately 6 months and then I was able to kick, luckily for good).  But I digress.  Acid was becoming the drug I returned to more and more.  By the time I was 16 years old, dosing 20 to 30 hits worth of liquid was becoming a normal routine for me.", "The bar we frequented when I was younger was a hangout for a number of the acid dealers that hung out in my particular scene, and at the end of a night they would often pour the leftovers of the sheets they'd been laying into our pitchers of beer, sometimes seventy-five to a hundred hits at a time, split between 5 or 6 people.  So large doses of LSD became very common.", "The experience that completely turned me off of the drug was about 4 years ago, when a friend of mine showed up in the park where me and a couple of other guys were hanging out with a swish bottle filled with about three hundred hits of liquid mixed with some Gatorade.  The four of us decided to split the bottle up and trip around the city for an evening.  We passed the bottle around, taking sips (that's why I say approximately 75 hits as the dose I took, because I'm just splitting the 300 hits four ways... I suppose it could have been 50 I drank, or 100, it's impossible to know for sure).  Within 45 minutes I was higher and more out of my mind than I'd ever been in my entire life (and I was no amateur when it came to drug abuse).  By the time I was peaking hours later, I was unable to move, speak or comprehend events occuring around me in even the usually disjointed way a person is able to when tripping on a more tolerable dose.  Visual hallucinations, which up until then had consisted of the usual trails and breathing walls and such, were now intensified to such a degree that I was seeing real live solid things that absolutely did not exist in reality.  Having conversations with real people that weren't there, watching buildings collapse around me, etc. etc...very similar to experiences I've heard described to me by avid peyote users (although I've never tried it myself).", "Now, I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who have experienced the kind of horrible trip where you're convinced you are not going to ever come down off the drug (the kind where, as soon as you start to come down, you realize how silly you were for ever thinking otherwise, yet the underlying terror remains).  Now, imagine this multiplied a hundred-fold.  I was so completely out of my mind that suicide began to look like a very viable, even pleasurable, option, not because of any depression or lack of will to live, but simply to make the trip end.  I remember bashing my head against a wall at one point to try and knock myself unconscious.  Eventually, after 14 hours or so, I began to come back to my senses (although the residual effects lasted for about another twenty or so hours after that).  Anyway, this experience completely destroyed my ability to have a good time doing acid, permanently.", "I did try the drug a couple of more times afterwards, always only one or two hits, and still I was always brought back to that same horrible trip, less intense, of course, but just as frightening.  My ability to control my frame of mind while tripping out was totally shot, and I haven't touched the drug in a little over 3 years, because when it ceases to be enjoyable, and you spend your whole trip wishing you hadn't dosed in the first place, then what's the point, right?  I don't suppose there's a moral to this story, or even a direct message, you can take from it what you like.  I don't want to say not to try the drug, because when I WAS able to handle it, I had some amazing revelations and even the odd life-changing experience.  Just be careful.", "I consider this the first time I REALLY tripped. I had taken LSD three times before: 2 paper hits twice, and one yellow geltab once, but all three of those experiences are blown away in comparison to this one.", "Mike, a well-seasoned tripper, got some yellow geltabs from his housemates. They had done it during the day and had basically asserted that they weren't all that potent. The one yellow tab I had done a couple of weeks before had pretty much only given me a slight mindfuck and no visuals, so I wasn't intimidated. So, Mike and I decided to trip that Saturday night.", "We each took one tab and left my house at 8:00 pm, in separate cars (big mistake), and went to go rent some good tripping. When we got to the video store, Mike joked 'R u feeling anything?' But the truth was, I was already starting to feel a little funny, and only maybe ten minutes had gone by.", "We left the store and headed to Mike's house. I followed him, Crystal Method pounding inside my car. I was a little uncoordinated when it came to getting on the expressway, and I kind of almost got in an accident, but I managed to get on the ramp OK. The ramp lifted me high up, or so it seemed, and I could see the city lights ahead like millions of little stars. There was construction on the expressway, so there were miles of flashing barricades set up. I wasn't having visuals yet, but it seemed like there were a hundred cars behind me, and what with the soundtrack, I felt like I was doing warp speed in a spaceship.", "After a slightly panicky ride of twenty minutes or so, we arrived at Mike's deserted house, at which point we took the second hit. I just felt weird for about a half hour or so. I could tell when it kicked in, because I had been dancing with glostix and Mike left the room, and I told him he didn't want to hang with the glostick reject and then I burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. I can still feel that cold ass tile floor against my back, and there I was, just cracking up. I finally managed to get up and go into the guest bathroom. The counter was moving in all sorts of awesome patterns, and for the longest time I just stared at it in marvel, occasionally laughing nervously. ", "When I managed to tear myself away from that scene, Mike and I went into his housemate's room, which had a ton of psychedelic posters and tie-dyed stuff in it. The posters looked incredible and almost three-dimensional. I then got on the bed, which was a waterbed, and lay on my back, staring at the ceiling. Above me, a huge black-and-orange tie-dyed sheet was draped across the ceiling. This was when the tie-dye lines started coming alive, slowly at first, and then they started hauling ass, going crazy. Mike had put some weird trippy electronic music on earlier, and I screamed for him to turn it off. It sounded menacing.", "There was an awful point in time where I thought I was going to go crazy. Mike came over to me and asked if I was going to be OK. I remember looking kind of over his shoulder, and through my peripheral vision a second, translucent face came out of his face, so it looked like he had two heads. I shoved my face into a mercifully dark pillow and moaned. I wasn't exactly sure. The only thing that kept me from falling apart was Mike telling me that he'd tripped so hard before, he had to touch the trees to make sure they were real. So if he had survived, then perhaps I would as well.", "Mike convinced me to go for a walk in the neighborhood. It was nighttime, but I have never seen so many colors in the dark before. Everything had its own distinct pattern: the sidewalk was done up in wavy stripes, the sky had some other psychedelic 60's looking pattern, etc. Dozens of metallic colors were all over the place. Everything had zillions of trails outlining it; my own body had so many trails dancing around it that I felt like I was wearing a thick astronaut suit. Thus, I was walking with my legs apart and arms out.", "The walk consisted of many colors and trails, and me thinking there were people where there weren't, and finally, me totally forgetting where the hell we were. I was happy when we reentered the safety of the house. For a while we lied down in Mike's room and I became engrossed in a lava lamp. I had a strange urge to take a warm bath. Also, it felt like my foot was on the verge of cramping up. It stayed that way for hours.", "Moments later, the rest of housemates got home. They were loud and happy, which boosted my experience. I looked thru the patio door to see one of them pulling little sticky seeds from his feet; to me, they looked like millions of little green baby grasshoppers. This wigged me out, so I went back in.", "We watched one of those psychedelic videos, and it looked so amazing. The screen showed a kaleidoscope of colors that kept morphing and morphing, and they looked razor sharp with detail. I remember being awed at how the mind could keep up with that speed. We popped in Fear and Loathing and laughed till we couldn't take it anymore. We even rewound some parts. When it was over, we watched it again with similar results. I was starving and was eating anything I could get my hands on. I ate some kind of party mix, and sugar cones, like the kind for ice cream. I found that eating very crunchy things was delightful while tripping.", "We finally put in The Matrix, and while it had good visual effects, it wasn't a comedy like the previous movie, and I began to wind down. Outside, I saw the sun was coming up. My eyes ached, like I had been straining them for a long time. About a quarter of the way thru the movie, we decided to go to bed.", "In bed, I felt like I had sunk about six inches into the mattress. It felt very soft, and the comforter felt as though I had swaddled myself in clouds. It was eerily quiet, like that static quiet you hear when u finally come out a loud club and you're partially deafened. I can't remember when, but I finally fell into a deep sleep.", "If that sounds like a pleasant experience, well, it was. I didn't really mean to ingest that much, and it was pretty freaky at first. I can't stress enough the importance of having a friend with you when you trip, preferably a friend who's done it plenty of times before at much higher doses, so that when u think the world and your mind are going to shatter into a million prismatic pieces, someone's there to convince you otherwise.", "My first LSD trip was actually kind of an accident.  The guy I usually buy shit from had been talking about some shit he had, hash and opium, but by the time I got around to hooking up with him he was out of hash and the opium was 'bottom of the barrel,' if you will.  I ended up buying four hits of acid, each dropped on some sort of gummy candy.", "The night I got them I popped one in my mouth, around 9:00 PM.  I have tried morning glory seeds before, to no great hallucinogenic effect (in LARGE quantities), so when I wasn't feeling much more than slight dizziness after about a half hour, I dropped another.", "I was lying on my bed, blacklight on accompanying numerous blacklight-sensitive gadgets.  Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock '69 recording was playing, a sound-sensitive light toy on top.  I first noticed a significant increase in energy.  Soon I found myself smiling broadly, immersed in the music.  I began to notice the walls rippling slightly.  This proceeded for an indefinite amount of time (LSD was not good for my time perception).  Eventually, I left to go get an issue of HighTimes from the other room.  I took it to the bathroom, where the lighting was better (my room has no normal white lights).  For the next hour or two I scanned the magazine, not moving forward or backward in the pages, just around.  I didn't really read (I remember trying and not being capable of mustering the concentration to comprehend each individual word).  I smiled broadly and laughed.  I was in a state of complete bliss, every color swirling and melting, every word evading my gaze.  I would try to scan every picture and segment of text on a page without being evaded by any, and felt quite proud of myself when (I believed that) I did.", "I eventually got up and left.  Everything was shifting and melting.  The patterns on the carpet, the blankets on the bed and the patterns on the pillow, even the dog's bed in the corner.  I peeked out the window over the water and was surprised to notice that it looked oddly normal.  I left the room and went to the computer.  The background at the time was a landscape with mountains in the distance and a sun in the sky that had been re-textured in a sort of tie-dye.  The colors bled and swirled.  I switched, with some effort, to a chat window I had left open and attempted briefly to decode what was being said.  I soon left out of boredom.", "This is when my trip took a bad turn, around 12:30.  My dad was still awake, watching the olympics (in Sydney, where it was just morning).  I realized that I wouldn't be able to talk to him or explain why I was awake in my state, so I turned off the blacklight (the only light) and the stereo.  I became very tense and remained so until around 4:00 when I fell asleep.  I couldn't keep from clenching my fists and grinding my teeth, often biting my cheeks as hard as I could to prevent the feeling of teeth scraping against teeth.  I wandered the hallway after my Dad went to bed.  Everything was still melting, only now the colors weren't emphasized as they had been; hard lines solidified and the colors around them turned dull.  I attempted to listen to music to mellow me out, but everything I tried to listen to sounded harsh and grating, from reggae to Jimi Hendrix's blues to hardcore to comedy.  By 2:00 or so I just wanted it to be over.  I kept checking the time, as if searching for some anchor to reality.  I found myself become more and more paranoid that I had somehow permanently damaged myself, and often repeated my name, birth date, etc., to myself to prove to myself that my mind hadn't been destroyed.  Finally, I fell asleep around 4:00.", "I woke up around 7:30, when I needed to leave for school, to my parents shouting at me for being so reluctant to get out of bed.  I quickly put on deodorant, brushed my teeth, and dressed, leaving with an english muffin in hand that I didn't feel like eating.  For the first half of the day I remained paranoid, my senses and mind somewhat dulled.  I felt like I had a fever, experiencing slight delirium and cold/hot sweats.  School was hell, but I was afraid to tell anyone because I thought they would find out that I had taken LSD.", "By the afternoon most of the symptoms had passed.  Although the latter portion of the trip wasn't extremely pleasant, and it fucked up the next day, I would still try acid again simply for the bliss I felt during the beginning (although next time I may only drop one hit).  I have gotten some advice on ways to lessen the comedown, most of which involve knocking yourself out so you can sleep through it all.  Overall, I would grade this an expanding experience, if not thoroughly positive.", "I was 18 the first time I experienced what would forever change my life.  My friend had done acid before, and I was intrigued with how a small piece of paper could cause some of the things she described.  She led me on my first trip...", "We were walking from a neighbor's apartment to our apartment, which was only a few yards when the effects started to occur.  It seemed like it took days to walk the short distance.  The hairs on my arms began to stand up...the air felt light...I felt like I was gliding along...noticing things I had never noticed before.  Lights had multiple colors, not just the white color I had only seen before.  The wind made the most incredible, exciting sounds through the trees.  Words are insufficient to describe the experience.  I felt I was in touch with the universe...like I was one with my friend...we could read each other's thoughts.  Life made absolute sense.", "I have described it to people by saying that the 'walls in my mind were torn down.'  I have never since seen life the same as before the first experience.  There is more reality now, be it good or bad, REALITY.  It is this continued perception that makes me believe one never comes down after doing acid.", "Me and some friends of mine went to ekoostik Hookah's 10th anniversary concerts, and being hippies, we thought acid would probably be the thing to do. We had all tried it before, but none of us were really experienced. We were camping beforehand, so we'd smoked a lot of marijuana earlier, and a couple some of my friends had drank some beer, but we were all fairly sober by the time we got the concert.", "First step, find some acid. No problem! We asked a couple people, and got directed to the right person. He told us 2 hits would have us seeing visuals within an hour. I took 2 hits at $5/hit, as did most of my friends, 2 of them took 1. This was apporximately 9:15 or 9:30, I'm not real sure of the time. A couple minutes later, I heard the guy we bought it from telling someone else about it '2 hits will send you to the cosmos.' Wait a minutes, didn't I just take 2 hits?", "About 10 minutes later, I could feel the acid starting to work. I started to feel jittery and anxious and had problems keeping still. Fortunately, the music started not too long thereafter, and I got up to dance. ", "I had been daning for about 10 minutes or so, a song or 2 into the first set, when a hippie chick who had put a sticker on my face earlier walked up to me. I spent almost the entire first set making out with her, and didn't find out anything more about her than her name. I must say, that was probably the best way to come on to acid that I could ever imagine. It's difficult to say how much the LSD was really affecting me at this point, as I was rather busy, there was something odd happening. Things were starting to get WIERD.", "During the break, I met back up with my friends who had dissappeared. After talking to them, I realized a good portion of the audience was tripping on the same stuff. This is when I realized how hard I was tripping. Talking in coherent sentences was extremely difficult, I could see trails off of almost everything. When I went into a different section of the music hall, the light was a more yellow color, and everything looked dirty all of a sudden, and everyone's eyes were red (probably from pot) and everyone looked sickly. So we got out of there and went upstairs to the back where we could relax.", "The setbreak seems to last forever (so did the first set) and it was almost agonizing the way it dragged on. I gave up looking for the chick because I was just tripping too hard. Finally, Hookah came back out. I realized not long thereafter, that one of my friends wasn't having that good a time. He was usually weary of crowds and I think it was just too much for him. Almost everyone else in the group was around dancing and having a good time, but I sat with him through most of it. He was really quiet most of the time, but would occasionally say something about him being dead and asking for answers. He had 5 or 6 sentences he more or less kept repeating. I knew it would be really difficult to get him out of there, so I just kept hoping that the set would last longer. By the time they got to the encore, all I could see of the band members were giant blurs when they played their instruments or otherwise moved. It felt like everything and everyone in the plus was wired in, even the band and the music. ", "At about 2:00, 2:30 in the morning the show ended. We managed to get my friend who was having the bad trip outsite, although it took a lot of work. We hung outside the music hall with a big group of hippies until we found my other two friends. One of them had started having a bad trip and they had left before the show ended, but she had been talked down by my other friend. ", "At this point, we piled into our cars, we had 2 drivers, both of whom took 1 hit. I don't advocate driving on LSD, it was probably pretty dumb, don't do it, but we had no choice, it was that or hang out by the car and risk getting arrested. The guy who was freaking out went in the other car, while I went with 2 of my other friends. I tried to get up back to the campsite, because I was the only one who knew the area, but I just couldn't find it. So we made it back to my house, I had to wake my dad up unfortunately, but he was so tired, I don't think he noticed. From there we called my friend's at the campsite. The guy who freaked out was coming around, so we hung around for an hour so we could come down a little. At about 5:00 AM we left for the campsite, we arranged a meeting with someone who knew where we were going and he led us back to the site. We stayed up and talked past dawn. The visuals were still with us, but our thought patterns had returned to normal. If I thought about it I could still see some mild trails and other faint visuals until about 7:00 or 8:00 the next day. ", "A very interesting time. The most intense trip I could ever imagine having. I had a good time, despite my friend, who returned to reality shortly after returning to the camp, though I don't think he will ever try LSD again. I'm sure I will, but it's gonna be a while, this trip had given me a lot to think about, especially musically and about the connections between band audience, and other things of that nature. It reminded me very much of what I'm imagining the acid tests were like in the '60s. Always check to make sure you know the potency of the acid you're taking, this stuff was amazingly strong, and really did send us to the cosmos. I almost lost control a couple times and my friend did. Never ever ever underestimate acid, that's the only advice I can give to anyone. ", "I still can't decide if I am bothered by the permanent marks LSD use has left in my life.  Any drug will change you, but acid is one whose scars are most noticeable. I have only tripped acid a total of six times, and yet I suffer from flashbacks almost all the time.  The most common problem is trails. Every time I walk through a doorway or pass a piece of furniture or similarly shaped object, especially from a light area into dark, I see very noticeable purplish metallic trails.  This happens every day, several times a day. I can look at things sober and know what it would look like tripping, where the shadows and highlights would be. One time I saw a girl with a tie-dye gray shirt on, and I got sucked into it. My heart rate went up, my head got tingly, and for the life of me I couldn't tell if her shirt was wet in certain areas or what. This lasted for much longer than it should have. I have had moments where I get that tripper mentality, that half-afraid, half-fascinated feeling where you think people are doing things on purpose, just to trip you out, because they know you're fucked up. One time I could have sworn I saw, and HEARD someone in my bathroom brushing their hair. I thought it was absurd, because there was no light on in there. But I could make out shapes in the darkness, I could see an arm moving up and down, I could hear the clicking of the brush on the counter.....my heart was pounding. Finally I got up and looked, and there was no one in there. Who knows what weird flashbacks lay ahead.", "I would hate to say never trip acid, because it is very unique, and under the right circumstances, very fun.  Who knows why it has affected me this way. It doesn't really bother me, but I could do without it. My suggestion would be, trip balls once or twice, and be done with it. It's cool to look at the world in a different light after trying a new drug, but in this light.....well, let's just say there are better ones.", "I will put the story regarding the most fucked up experience at the Nassau Greatfuld dead show. I took 1 whole sugar cube..It had like a blue dot where the drop was made. Someone later told me, examining the other cubes I had, that it looked like 3, or 4 hits. I freaked out! I have tripped many times and after reading lots about the acid tests and lots of history about the 60's I believed I was normal, and was just having fun. I never before 'Freaked' or even got out of hand, this night..I was so far gone. It involved me running across the highway in the middle of the night, thinking I was going to be kidnapped, and was being chased, then after trying to break store windows to get the police, I tried to kick in the little booth at a gas station mini mart. Because I thought one of the customers was one of the killers and he was gonna shoot me. I screamed and begged the gas station guy to call 911 and he wouldn't listen so I started kicking the door thinking he was in on it.", "Police arrived and I thought they were the black military.(all the cops 3 cruisers showed up, they were all black) I thought I had been captured by the black military and he questioned me and put me in the cruiser. I was waiting when 4 guys pulled up and I later found that they were just asking for directions, I thought they were asking the black military to give me up..(they were white in hippy clothes) I figured this was the white hippy group trying to save me from the black military, So I told the cops I didn't feel well so I could get out of the back seat. (I had used this tactic originally to jump out of the car on the highway, of the two girls I thought were kidnapping me.) When I got out of the cruiser I grabbed one of the hippies shirt and screamed and begged him to take me with them.. The guy looked at me Like I was NUTS. I said 'You know me right???? Please take me with you' He was like...I don't know you dude...He was looking at me like i WAS A MENTAL PATIENT. ", "Well I ended up going to the police station and My girlfriend had to take a cab from Manhattan to Long island just to get me home. They let me off saying I had just smoked some bad pot, but the chief officer wanted to bust me for LSD But I had nothing on me..MY pupils were HUGE the Cops were like woa look at this guys eyes. Any how the cops turned out to be real nice and probably saved my life. At the point they found me at the gas station, I begged the cops not to shoot me. It was a fucked up night and I say, Do Blotter acid stay away from the cubes or liquid if you have an imagination. it really was like getting wacked on the head I had no idea what was real and what was fantasy. ", "But I admit when I got to Orlando to see the dead..I took a half of the other cube :-) I just figured don't let my imagination run wild.. Try and behave normal and think happy thoughts..If you think about bad, sad, or painful situations while tripping they will put you on a bad trip..I thought a bad trip was bullshit..people who didn't know how to take the drug. But it got me and I was really freaked out. I honestly believed I was going to die that night. I apologize for the typing but I am really tired.", "I have always been terribly interested in LSD.  As a teenager I was obsessed with the hippie counterculture of the sixties and its psychedelic mind set.  After much self-debating and endless hours of research on the drug, I dropped acid for the first time on my twenty second birthday - less than two months ago.", "I did it with two girls who I became very close to in college.  They are both very experienced drug users and extremely trustworthy, loving people.  I wanted my first experience to be with them.  They did a lovely job setting the mood.  They threw a miniature surprise party for my birthday and just generally got me completely psyched up about tripping (i.e. presenting me with a birthday card showing a badly-drawn girl with large, fried-egg eyes and a caption that read, 'Just do eet!').", "When the time came to drop, the girls took their hits right out of an eye dropper full of liquid acid and presented me with a sugar cube that they had dosed with one hit especially for me.  I was extraordinarily hesitant about putting that thing in my mouth.  I had gone round and round with myself for months about the ins and outs of trying acid.  Would I have a bad trip?  Would I freak out?  Have a seizure?  I have never been a terribly happy person.  I am currently, and was at the time, on antidepressants, and consistently suffer from bouts of extreme insecurity and pessimism.  Everyone had told me that acid magnifies your emotions times 1000.  What if LSD made naked all those hidden parts of my mind and I just lost it?  Partly from the completely positive encouragement of my friends, and partly from pure exhaustion from overanalyzing, I just did eet, and munched on the small, sweet block that would take me... I didn't know where.", "We were going to a concert at a small club.  After we dropped we all got ready and left at about ten pm.  On the way to the club, the cassette that was playing in the car kept screwing up and slowing down, and I thought I was tripping.  I asked my friends if they heard what I was hearing, and they burst into laughter.  We joked about it the rest of the way.  ", "When we got to the club, we went to the upstairs balcony, where it was very quiet and cool and we just sat by a window and talked.  Eventually, I began to feel... different, but nothing special.  I felt a little like I did when I had tried ecstasy, just a general feeling of calmness and well being.  Colors and sounds also began to distort ever so slightly.  When I closed my eyes, some red lights behind me that were actually pretty dim seemed blindingly bright in my peripheral vision.  I also often felt as if someone were standing next to me or behind me or that someone was walking towards me, but, when I turned to look for somebody, no one was there.  ", "My friends decided to drop a little more.  It had been about an hour and a half at this point, and I was feeling fine, so I decided to take one more hit.  When L dosed me, though, she squeezed too hard and I got two.  'What the hell,' I figured, and lapped them up.  It tasted interesting - slightly metallic.  ", "We finally got up and went downstairs and right up to the stage.  The show was about to start and there was a very palpable excitement in the air.  I heard someone call my name and turned to see my sister.  We hugged and talked and she said she would like to drop (she is a relatively experienced LSD user).  L dosed her and we stood talking some more.  Suddenly, one of the amplifiers on the stage emmitted a horribly loud, booming buzz of feedback.  At that instant, I truly felt my trip kick in head first.  The buzzing must have lasted three seconds, but it felt like an eternity.  I felt a hole spread in my chest (not unlike the chest holes I feel sometimes when I smoke really potent pot) and my body felt as if it would be rammed into the vibrating ground.  It was exhilerating and scarily trapping at the same time.  My sister left to get a beer from the bar and promised to come back.", "The show started and I was zinging.  People around me were passing joints and I accepted a few, though no marijuana high would ever show its face through the electric curtain in my head tonight.  I had never FELT music as I felt it that night.  It flowed through every part of my body and mind and I had no choice but to dance.  ", "And I did wig out - just a little bit.  My sister had been gone for a while and I began to get worried.  The rational part of me knew that the crowd had simply gotten too thick and she couldn't make it back up front, but my acid clouded mind was conjuring up a million places she could be - trampled under the crowd, out in the cold alone and tripping by herself, maybe she decided to leave and was in a car accident.  These thoughts haunted me every time I turned around and couldn't see her in the audience.  I got so worried at one point that N (my sister) became my whole world.  People began to look like her.  She has shocking bottle red hair, so my vision took on a magenta tint.  I heard her voice behind me and turned to see strangers talking.  The bongo drummer in the band was N for a second.  And, I can never say for sure if this phenomenon took place in the realm of vision or mind or memory, but I was peppered with triangular shards that contained her face and voice.  I equated it to watching a movie in a theater, and sometimes you see those strange black circles that pop up in the corner for a fraction of a second.  That is what it was like.  Like clips from a movie.  Shards of glass where she was trapped and wanting a way out...", "I knew though.  I held myself together.  I told myself that it was ME fucking with ME, and that I could control that.  And I did.  I took hold of A's hand and squeezed it hard.  Instantly she could tell I was having a tough time and she just smiled and squeezed back.  As we held hands, we danced, and we began to clap out the rhythm of the music together.  We stumbled a bit at first, but the synthesis became perfect... we were improvising, filling in gaps in the beat and adding our own sequences, and it was perfect.  We were truly, mystically connected through the music, and it was beautiful.  When the song was over, we hugged and kissed each other.  We didn't have to say a word.", "So I forgot about my sister (who, by the way, wound up having a great time that night while avoiding stampedes and bad vibes), and the rest of the night was cake - and wonderful.  Of course, the crowd was very tight, so people were constantly bumping into me or rubbing me as they passed.  But I felt each touch in detail.  It was like my body was being licked by giant tongues from all directions.  And I danced and danced.  The music was strange and a feast for all the senses.  I felt as if I finally came to a long sought understanding of psychadelia.  I heard strange things in the music.  Exaggerated chords became a woman screaming.  Any miniscule buzz, bleep, or bell echoed through me.  At one point, during a song peak, I threw my head backwards and felt as if colors were rushing up my neck.  I didn't really SEE colors when I closed my eyes, rather I thought them, and they became visual all the same.  I travelled through tunnels of liquid metal, swirling vortexes of tie dyed patterns, bright, checkered rabbit holes with millions of branches.  When the band took a break, I felt as if I had lost something, as if I had been holding the music in a ball in the pit of my stomach and it had flown away.", "During intermission, my friends and I sat outside to cool off.  We smoked cigarettes and laughed at everything.  We were simply, unabashedly giddy and happy.  We spent the second half of the concert on the balcony, where it was much less crowded.  I didn't dance much this time around.  I mostly sat and thought, just watching people and feeling good.  When the show was over we met up with some other friends and stood around until we were kicked out.  For the rest of the night, I felt terribly inarticulate and tired.  I could barely open my mouth, let alone speak.  If someone asked me a question, I nodded a yes or no answer.  My body was worn out, but my mind was still sizzling with incomprehensible colors and thoughts.  ", "We went home and sat up talking for a couple of hours.  We were all starving and had leftover tetrazini from earlier in the evening and big cups of cranberry juice that tasted incredible.  In the end, I was the only one left awake.  This turned out to be the most difficult part of the trip for me.  I had a terrible time trying to go to sleep.  There was beautiful music playing on the stereo, but it eventually became grating noise as I grew more tired and irritable.  I fought, punched, and kicked this thing called sleep in the teeth.  I thought I had forgotten how to fall asleep, that I would simply be awake forever and always be tripping, and I should just accept it.  When I closed my eyes, it was as if someone had turned on a strobe light in my brain.  A bright light flashed and whirred.  Sleep came eventually, after about three hours of tossing and turning, teeth gritting, cursing, and begging.", "In the end, I guess I was left mystified by the whole experience.  I don't think I really learned anything about myself or about others.  It didn't profoundly change my perspective on anything.  Rather, it just served to enhance things I already knew intuitively.  Interconnectedness, hidden psychic abilities, an electric rhythm and pulse behind - everything.  I do think that tripping is a sort of intrusion, though - an intrusion into a part of ourselves and the world that maybe we are not supposed to see because the potential for exposure and artificiality is just too great.  But that's just what makes it so damned intriguing, eh?  I am in no hurry to try acid again - it was too intense and physically draining for me to do routinely - but I definitely think I will try it again in the future.", "I bought some LSD from a guy I worked with back in October. They were in sugar cube form. I took them home and put them in my desk. I had tripped on acid a few times before, but either with a friend or at school. I was home by myself one night (I live with my parents) and the temptation was too much. People had told me before to never trip alone because it would send me on a bad trip. But I decided... What the hell! VERY BAD DECISION. I took one cube and forty five minutes passed without effect. (It usually took about thirty minutes in my previous trips.) I took a second and waited about five minutes and I could feel it start to take effect. I wanted to be taking a shower when it fully hit me. (It's a bigger trip than you can imagine unless you've done it before.) I showered for about fifteen minutes and then got out to discover my parents were home early. 'Okay, I'll just play it off and say I'm going to bed', I thought to myself. I got in my room and laid on my bed looking at the ceiling. I could actually feel and see the ceiling dripping on my face. This was some very trippy stuff. ", "Foolishly, I turned out the light. I got back in bed and after a couple of minutes started getting real scared. I thought for some reason that I was going to die. I would close my eyes for awhile, then open them to make sure I wasn't dead yet. My whole life started flashing before my eyes. (Sorry for the cliche) It got to the point where I was so scared I was going to die that I thought to my self, 'I need to get some help before this ends my life.' I got out of bed and walked down the hall to the living room where my dad was watching TV. 'I'm on LSD and I think I'm going to die!', I blurted out. If I was about to die but needed something to push me over the edge, the look on my dad's face would have done it. 'WHAT!?!?!?!?!' He was reeeeeaaaallly pissed. He sat me down on the couch and tried to calm me down. ", "From that point on, I only remember flashes of what happened. I remember taking a cushion off the couch and throwing it into the fireplace. Then I remember walking back towards my room. My dad put his hand on my shoulder and I involuntarily turned around and planted a fist on his jaw. He grabbed me and threw me onto the couch and yelled 'Now you stay there!', and got on the phone. Next thing I new, I was staring up at half a dozen unfamiliar faces. They all had walkie-talkies and I heard one of them say (while holding a flashlight in my eyes) 'You can't see anything but the pupil.' They put my shoes on me and led me out the front door. My first step outside was not very stable and I ended up face first on the sidewalk, with blood running out of my forehead. ", "They carried me to an ambulance and I don't remember anything else except arriving at the hospital and looking up at doctors who were strapping things with with wires attached to them on my chest a poking me with hard objects. I was strapped down on my bed and I kept trying to get up. An old ugly nurse kept coming over and asking me the same questions over and over and it was driving me insane. 'This is hell.' I thought. I've already died and I'm in hell. You don't (or maybe you do) know what it's like thinking your in hell. I started crying because I was so scared. Then I fell asleep and woke up to a doctor's voice. 'How ya doin? Ya feel allright?' 'Yeah, I'm okay.' I replied. 'You ready to go home?'(Stupid question) 'Most definitely' I said. As I got up and started leaving with my dad I heard him say 'You're a very lucky young man.' Whatever that meant. ", "Besides the bad memories, I have a fuckin' huge hospital bill that my insurance won't pay for because it was a drug related incident. I haven't even had a beer since that night. I'm afraid to what it might lead to. Well, thanks for taking the time to read this, I'm not trying to scare anyone, or tell you to quit using, I just know what it's like to have a bad experience and if you haven't tried acid yet and are thinking about it, make sure you know what you're getting into.", "Mindset:  For about 6 months before the trip I had been severly depressed about many different aspects of life, spirituality, etc.  ", "Setting:  I had not been taking any medication of any kind before this time.  Several friends and I were on our way to another friend's house, having planned to do various drugs and spend the night at the location.  I had bought 3 hits and planned on dropping 2 of them based on my friend's recommendation (secretly, I took the third after arriving at the house).  The house where we were planning on staying was a warm and comforting location, with many 'trippy' lights and paintings and such, and overall very non-threatening.", "Twenty-five minutes after taking the last hit, I began to experience various visual hallucinations, such as swirling walls and changes in color.  After about 2 hours I began to realize that things were happening that were not supposed to be happening (people and events seemed to be lagged in time), so I started to fight the trip.  I experienced paranoia, anxiety, negative thoughts and I would only let one certain person touch me because the others seemed to be bad actors trying to make me think they were people.  Someone said that it was only temporary, so I went into the bathroom to calm myself down by looking in the mirror and concentrating.  After 5 mintues of doing this it seemed as though everything began to spiral out of control, and I thought I had to get the drug out of my system as soon as possible by forcing myself to vomit as much as I could.  I was probably there for 10 more minutes vomiting before someone came in to stop me.", "I had to be dragged home because I was screaming at anyone who would look at me, and I could not stay at the house.  At this point in the night I became too detached to remember what really happened, and what was just a hallucination, but I was taken home and my parents put me to bed.  During the night I got up to try to make myself vomit again (I don't know how long it had been since I dropped, possibly 6-8 hours) and when I looked in the mirror the whites of my eyes had been replaced with blood.  This scared me so much I went back to bed, to find out the next morning that that was real, and I had burst many blood vessels in my eyes and it would take more than 3 weeks to heal.  My face was bruised from a struggle that no one remembers happening.  I had to wear sunglasses because of the fact that my eyes made me look like a corpse.  the end.", "LSD is a crazy drug to take. You have to be in the right frame of mind mostly to take it, as I'm sure many of you already know.", "My first experience with acid was a little odd..yet at the same time very eye-opening.", "It was April of 1999.. I had just gotten out of work at Friendly's (I was a waitress) at an extremely late hour. A large group of my friends (about 50 people) had planned on going to this abandoned warehouse and having a party. A large group of us wanted to trip. I agreed.", "I was pissed off that I had gotten out of work so late, and therefore I was in a terrible mood. ", "I dropped at about 10:45ish on a Saturday night. Many people told me to think positively and to get in a better frame of mind so that I wouldn't have a bad trip. I tried my hardest.", "After I dropped, we all went to the warehouse and parked our cars. I felt nothing.", "I got out and walked around..at this point it was probably already 11:45 and still I felt nothing. I began wondering if I would feel anything off of this so-called 'great' hallucinogenic drug.", "I felt a little nauseous so I sat in my car for a while. I put on the radio and lay back for a bit..some mild techno was playing on the stereo. I closed my eyes. Colors began appearing while my eyes were shut.. Swirling and transforming to the music..I was paralyzed from the neck down. I couldn't move. My whole body felt stuck in this warped illusion that I was experiencing. I felt sick when I opened my eyes, so I simply lay back and kept my eyes shut while people wandered all about me and talked to me.. I could hear nothing, only the music that was playing in the background. The colors changed patterns every second, and the twists and turns amazed me and sent me into a psychadelic twist of phenomenal visuals that I could only see with my eyes shut. I felt as though I was stuck in a kaleidoscope that kept turning and turning and wouldn't stop.", "It eventually became time to leave, and I was in no condition to drive. My friend 'P' drove to a hotel where we were all supposed to get a room. As the sun rose over the horizon, the sky looked purple and I remarked how beautiful everything seemed.", "We all ended up in the Burger King parking lot at about 7:00 AM after being unable to retrieve the room we expected to get.", "I looked at myself in the rear view mirror, feeling horribly ugly and disgustingly dirty. The trip had ended, but I still felt disconnected from reality and the world in general.", "Two of my friends and myself went back to my house at about 8:00 AM. We took a shower and did our make-up and got dressed. I still felt ugly as hell and disgusting. I noticed all of my imperfections and was dissatisfied with the way I looked altogether. I tried to correct the wrongness with my appearance; however, nothing seemed to work and we left my house and went to a local park. I felt extremely out of place. Not only did I wish I hadn't taken the drug, but I wished I was dead. I felt like I had no reason to be alive.", "I didn't feel suicidal at the time, but I wanted the horrible reality that I was faced with to wear off. I felt like everybody was against me and like I was an outcast or an outsider.. Nobody understood exactly what I was feeling. ", "Eventually I took the two friends home and I returned to my abode. I lay down in my bed, and played Sublime - 40 Oz. To Freedom. I closed my eyes to a horrendous attack of visuals coming from all sides and every direction. I felt like I was stuck in a continuous movie. I remember seeing stop signs and furry animals and all kinds of unbelievable things that just kept popping up in coordinance with the songs that were playing. It was the only CD I wanted to hear. ", "Eventually I fell asleep (thank god) and woke up at about 7:00 PM. I went down to Burger King (where most of my friends at the time hung out) and nobody was there except my friend 'P'. I felt out of place, once again, and disconnected. I didn't want to be faced with all of these thoughts that were running through my head.. things like: Do they like me? Why am I here? How did I get here? What's wrong with me?.. basic questions that everybody asks, but I was thinking more on a general level rather than a universal level. ", "Two of my friends came into my car and we went to some party that was held in some kids backyard. However, his backyard was the size of a large industrial waste dump. And that's exactly what it looked like, except cleaned up and very homey. ", "I had just recently started hanging out with these people, and I still felt very uncomfortable sharing my thoughts with them..especially now that I was thinking crazy thoughts.", "I drank some Cisco and I felt a little better, like I was more into what was going on around me..all of the talk and happiness about just hanging out sunk into me and I felt at home.", "This kid that I started hanging out with, 'DM', arrived at the small get together. He had tripped with us the previous night also. I felt like he was the one I really needed to talk to about it all. I pulled him aside and asked him to meet me at Burger King after this small party was over. We met up there, and exchanged a few hello's.. we got into my car and started driving. I shared every single thought with him and he understood perfectly.", "'DM' really helped me clean up my mind and at about 2 AM I went home feeling relieved as hell that the horror was finally over and like I could actually sleep without feeling self-conscious and guilty.", "Having LSD available to me for the first time, I immediately took four drops of the mint flavored liquid.  I had tried a low dose of AMT before and about four days previously a dose (~45mg) of 2C-T-7, but was unable to break into the psychedelic region with either.", "My inhibitions rapidly dropped away, but I remained in complete control of myself mentally and physically (maybe it was weak acid or I was still somewhat tolerant from the 2C-T-7).  Before long I found myself hitting (well, more accurately, politely asking for sexual favors) on a sober friend of mine (but not before calling my gf and asking if it was okay).  Luckily, my friend is cool with that stuff and didn't read anything more into it than a compliment on attractiveness.", "Not too much later, someone brought out the nitrous.  I took a ballon and entered the nitrous world, but with far more euphoria than I had ever experienced before.  After a ballon, I would experience five minutes of bliss listening to music so distorted by my mind that it was really something else entirely (I refer to it as the nitrous song because every time, no matter what I listen to, it turns into the same thing).  I started going through ballons like mad and ended up 'wasting' a great deal of my trip trying to work the stuck cracker.", "It was only later coming down that things got really interesting.  Mostly down, I went to wander around outside in the dim predawn light.  I ended up lying down next to a fountain and telling myself that, like the Buddha, I would not move until I experienced a revelation (I had been reading a lot about LSD and religious experiences).  Trying to concentrate my mind on religious issues, I sat there for about 15 minutes.", "Then a bubble of realization appeared in my mind, telling me that I could not believe in God because my parents had divorced.  God was the father and as I was raised by my mother, I could not trust that God would be there to take care of me.  Right then I started believing in God with a great sense of relief and euphoria.  I was completed because I could believe and trust in the goodness and purpose of the world.", "I got home and actually kneeled down and began to pray (for a longtime atheist, this was quite a change).", "Later I sobered up.  I was still deeply affected by my experience, but I wasn't naive enough to actually believe in god.  After all, even if the psychological cause of disbelief had to do with my parents, this didn't give me any reason to believe god existed.  Moreover, I was not convinced this was the reason for my loss of faith.", "Psychedelics provide insight into the workings of our minds, but these insights can be traps for the unwary.  Certainly god and my parents' divorce are important issues for me, but who can say how they relate or if they even do.", "I decided I wanted to try LSD for a lot of reasons. I had some hang-ups about being naked that frustrated me and my new husband John. He couldn't understand why I still had problems trusting him, and neither could I. I was so jealous of people who felt free enough and comfortable enough with themselves to be able to display their bodies without feeling terrified or even the least bit nervous. I also had this underlying self-hatred that just drove me crazy. I wanted to have the confidence in myself that everyone else appeared to have.", "For a year I had been working on making it better. John was my largest motivation because I could see in him how frustrated he was with me. I got to a plateau where progress was no longer being made. My need for control had trapped me. I was in the position where I had to give up very precious comfort in order to go forward, and I just couldn't do it. I decided that LSD was the answer, like electroshock therapy was for the insane. ", "John was getting more and more annoyed with me about my strong desires to use LSD. He has used it a few times in his life, and he knew what it was all about. Because of my terrible reactions to marijuana the thought of me on LSD terrified him. He told me I was obsessive, and I probably was. I was so very anxious to change, and I knew he would be so much happier with me once I did.", "It was difficult to actually get my hands on the drug. My brother who uses drugs very liberally was no help at all, but was anxious to get his hands on whatever I was able to get. He offered to try it out first to determine how much I should take, and whether it was safe or not. My friend pulled through for me beyond my expectations and finally I had it in my hands.", "Within a half-hour of telling my brother about it, my brother had it in his mouth. The next day he gave it his stamp of approval. What was left of the strip of paper was a little less than an inch and a half. My brother took about a half-inch square. He recommended that I cut up what was left of the paper into five pieces and then take one piece. I told John to cut up what was left into thirds because a fifth didn't seem like enough to me. ", "Then out of the blue John asked me if I wanted to take it now. I couldn't believe he suggested it, especially after all the fights we had had about me doing it at all. I dropped one of the three papers under my tongue at 3:00 PM (Presidents Day) and we watched Big Top Pee Wee. An hour passed and I was feeling in a particularly good mood, but I wasn't seeing anything, and it seemed like nothing was happening. I told John I was feeling pretty disappointed, and that perhaps my brother was lying about the strength of the drug. After an hour and a half John amazingly suggested 'Still nothing? OK Take another and I'll take the last one.' The movie was hilarious and bizarre, and occasionally scary. At the end I remember laughing and laughing at the image of an elephant in overalls. John said 'Now that's just WRONG!'", "At 5:00 PM I was feeling pretty stoned. I had noticeable shakes and the walls started breathing around me. I also felt like I was in the best mood of my life. We put in some music and it hit me like a ton of bricks. Time started crawling at an incredibly slow pace. I snuggled up to John and relaxed. My mind started to float away. I was enjoying this non-thought and the feeling of John's body next to me was the most wonderful feeling in the world. I tried to play the piano and the sound of it was strange and new. I was still able to play when I wasn't thinking, but when I concentrated the music just slowed to a halt. We had a hard time finding CDs to play because they either had skips or they just stopped in mid-song. Then I realized that I didn't quite know what I was, where I was, who I was, what we were doing. The only thing that I knew was that I was in a living room, assumed to be MY living room. As for the rest of the universe, it wasn't there. All there was was that room and the only other person who existed was John. My ability to communicate was shot, and everything we tried to say to each other echoed in my mind until it made no sense, while at the same time it made more sense than anything has ever made sense. Every attempt at conversation left me laughing. I was smiling so much my lips started to tremble from the effort. I watched the curtains in the living room flow like liquid into itself. Bright and neon green. The walls around me towered to a point where I felt like I was only a foot tall. ", "We were smoking like crazy, because time had slowed so much it seemed like there was a smoke in my hand for hours at a time. He complained about how much I was smoking, but in between smokes it felt like there had been at least a half-hour of non-smoking. When I moved the cigarette around it had what I would call a 'chaser tracer'. I'd watch the cherry of the cigarette move, then a bright red spark would chase it wherever I moved it. I figured that one of my eyes was following the smoke a little slower than the other.", "I had to make a trip to the bathroom due to waves of nausea. The walk through the hall was very long, and I thought I would be walking forever. The walls pulled away from me the more I walked.  In the bathroom I stared into the sink with the water splashing onto the drain. The water appeared to make the metal drain plug melt as if it was acid rain. I turned and looked at the bright yellow shower curtain and it breathed and flowed like the curtains in the living room, like liquid. I lost the feeling of having to throw up and I decided I was just making myself sick by thinking about sickness. I came back to the living room and hugged up to my husband again.", "I tried to explain to him what it was like for me. How reality wasn't reality anymore, and how I didn't know what our purpose was or what we are supposed to do the next day or the day after. I so appreciated his ability to hear what I was saying, and to respond appropriately. Then it seemed like I was looking at myself from above, out of my body. I floated there for only a moment, blinked, and was back in my body.", "I felt so much love for John then, that it swallowed me. No emotion I have felt was ever that strong. All I could say was that I loved him, that I trusted him, that I needed him. As confused as my words sounded to me as they came out, John seemed to understand me completely. I felt that he and I were connected through our minds. By the time I started to understand what an earth was, and that we were on it, I realized that my mind was being pieced back together after a complete loss of reality. I subconsciously decided that this was the best time to rewrite myself, to change myself to be what I always wanted to be. I didn't even remember what was wrong with me but I knew I had the ability at that very moment to change myself. I talked out loud to myself saying 'I am beautiful, I love myself' regardless if I thought I believed it or not, and regardless of how corny it was. Then I took off my clothes and said 'I'm not afraid to be naked, I like being naked'. This was in the full light that was always my enemy. John embraced me about the waist and told me I was the most beautiful woman in the world. I was able to wander around the house, in the light, completely nude, and even though I felt frightened I knew that nobody would hurt me, because remember the only other person in the world (the living room was the world) was John.", "I wanted to lie down in the bedroom because the music was too intense and the light was bright. We lay down and talked for a long time, never quite making much sense. He started kissing me and his lips were wonderful and soft. Suddenly I realized that we were having sex, and I laughed my ass off at the thought of it. It seemed like such a ridiculously silly thing to do that I couldn't help but laugh. I never knew I was turned on in the least, but sure enough I was wet. Every one of his moans shot this intense pleasure through me as if everything I did to please him pleased me as well.  I thought about how primal it was, like we were animals, which we are. I thought about how wonderful it would feel to have a baby growing inside me, and he said 'I want to fill you up with babies' which was incredibly romantic in the moment. The bedroom had this strobe-light effect of flashing light. The light was as blinding as the darkness. ", "I got dressed, and made the bed. I loved the softness of the blankets and I wanted to roll around in them for a while. I followed John into the living room and I was completely amazed that the CD player was still playing the CD that I put on earlier. How could this be?!? That seemed like 10 hours ago!! John insisted that he had pushed play on the CD again and that it had started over, but I thought 'You are so screwing with my head John!'", "John decided he was going to go to the store to buy some cigarettes. I didn't like this idea at all. I didn't know how hard he was tripping, if he knew what he was doing at all, and if anyone would know he was on drugs. I sat and thought about this for what seemed like forever, and I just couldn't grasp the idea of John going to the store without me to buy smokes. I made a valiant effort of trust in him and said against all my of instincts 'OK John, go to the store and I'll wait here alone'. The thought of being all alone seemed frightening to me, as well as the thought of John out there all alone. I imagined him wandering off into the woods and getting lost, and at that moment I almost ran outside to try to find him. Another valiant effort kept me inside to wait for him, because I had to trust him. And sure enough he came back home safe and sound.", "We lay down in bed together and watched the hallway. The ceiling looked like it reached down to the floor, and the door in the hall was morphing around in a neat kind of way. Then the light of the hallway compared tothe darkness of the bedroom that we were lying in really had a cool effect. The doorway looked like a pool of water vertical to the wall, and the images of the hallway were only a reflection in the water, bobbing and rippling. John said I should look at this light bulb because it was the coolest. I decided the light bulb was turning around in circles like a surveillance camera. It stretched out and I said 'It's a surveillance penis!'", "Then I turned over and looked into the closet. It reminded me of being a child and how the clothes in the closet would morph into monsters. Sure enough there were monsters in that closet. There were little spiral bright rainbow dealies flying everywhere that were rather interesting as I peered into the closet.  I saw skulls and spiders in there, so I decided to roll over again away from that. John was trying to tell me a story about the history of mushrooms and acid, but all I could pay attention to was his face and how it expanded and contracted in a scary kind of way. Then his face morphed into the face of a woman which was pretty funny to me at that moment.", "John's trip was ending while mine wasn't, and I couldn't sleep.  We attempted sex again which was fun but I couldn't come for the life of me. Then he lay down to sleep because he had to work the next morning and it was already 2:00 AM. I told him that I was so proud of myself for doing so well that day, and that my life would never be the same.", "I tried to stay as still as I could while he started snoring away. I watched the images behind my eyelids that looked like stereotypical acid images like from Yellow Submarine. Happy flowers flowing into birds flowing into teddy bears, etc. I got up and went into the bathroom. There's a night light in there so I decided to leave the light off. The entire bathroom was very red. I stood there in front of the mirror and just stared at my nude body. I loved the way it looked with the red hue everywhere.  ", "I finally fell asleep at around 4:00 AM, only to wake up at 6:45 AM to drive John to work.", "A few weekends ago some of my friends and I went to a rave in Austin.  I had some LSD to sell and take.  I was really stupid about obtaining it becuase I didn't 'try before you buy.'  which I normaly do when buying any large amount of drugs.  I sold it to about 30 people right away.  It turned out that it was incredibly weak.  The potencey was about 8=1.  I was screwed.  People were mad and I had to give out some refunds (I'm a small person and they were large persons)", "Because mine was so weak my friend found another dealer and payed for two drops.  He held out his hand to get the drops on the back of his hand, but the guy said, no stick out your tounge.  He felt a stream pour into his mouth.  The dealer didn't notice that he had just poured half his acid into my friends mouth.", "It has taken him a long time to remember all of the things that happened that night.  He ran up to one of our friends and told him the story rather excitedly.  5 minutes later he was sitting on a chair when I saw him.  I asked him if he found any, and he told me the story a little less excited as it was kicking in hard.", "About 30 minutes later he was climbing all over people and asking what his name was.  At the party he knew 3 sentences:  'Whats my name,' 'this is not reality,' and 'where am I'  Our ride was tired and wanted to go home.  So we decided to leave.  My friend hadn't tried to walk until this happened...  We discovered that he couldn't walk or even stand.", "The place was crawling with cops for some reason (PMA scare most likely)  They kept walking past him when he was on the chair and looking at him funny.  We got to the door where two officers were standing.  He fell to the ground unexpectedly.  The cops looked at us and started talking, then looked back.  His girlfriend was so mad at this point that she said to leave him.  We put him back on the chair and were going to leave two of my friends to look after him.", "I followed my ride out reluctantly.  We got in the car and started to pull out.  I saw a different friend standing in the parking lot looking very lost.  We stoped and rolled down the window.  she franticly told us that some one had told the cops what was going on...  we know the owner of the venue so he grabed us and ran us back to my tripping friend.  There were about 6 cops circleing him and shineing flash lights in his eyes.  his girlfriend cryed at two of the cops and they agreed to let us take him home.", "We picked him up and started walking out.  he put a smoke in his mouth, looked at a cop, said 'shit, dude, is that a cop' and pointed at another cop.  The cop said to me 'are you sure you know how to handle this?'  I said yes we will get him some sleeping pills.", "we took him to the car with all the cops at the place following us.  They told us that we should take him to the emergency room to get checked out.  They bid us good luck and we set off.  He learned to say : I want some pot, I want some coke, and I want a cigarette.  on top of the others.  we remembered that we had a video camera with us and decided to tape him.  not to be mean, but to show him what he looks like when he does lots of drugs.", "We got to the store at about 4 am to buy the sleeping pills.  we parked in the furthest spot from the store in order to keep my tripping friend away from people he didn't know.  I ran into the store and got the pills.  When I got back we sat around for about an hour taping him and calming him down.  He learned about 10 new phrases during this hour.", "We got home, snuck him in, and went to his room.  He didnt know what we were saying.  He didnt understand what be quiet meant.  He was talking loudly.  My friends mom woke up and came in.  We told her that we came home early and that we were just talking about the party.", "That was the scary part for all of us.  he remembered his visuals the next day.  he said it went beyond acid visuals.  he was almost in another demention.  when people walked they would melt into the floor, then a line would apear right on the path that they were walking, then if they stopped, they would re-appear.  he said that he could not see himself in anyway.  things melted onto things and stayed that way for minutes at a time.  His body felt normal yet he was totaly in a pschotic state.  He also thought that he was gay for two days afterwards.", "After seeing this I would never let anybody dose me directly.", "My first time ever on acid was not too long ago. I was so very exited about my first time, because I have heard how good it was or is. Well let me tell you this trip was sure interesting. Me and my best girl friend went on a field trip to Magic Mountain, so we decided that the trip would be more fun if we did some type of drug. So we decided acid would be the one. Well we sure did have an interesting trip.", "We decided to take the tabs about an hour before getting to Magic Mountain. So we took them in the bus. Not too long after taking them everything started to have its own world. My trip started about me complaining how hot and smoggy it was. The day was actually pretty cold. My friend was telling me to be quiet because it was just me and the drug saying this, but really I was sooo hot and could not breathe because of the 'smog'. I didn't know what was going on. I was kinda scared.", "During this trip I brought my diary along with me and here is what my friend and I wrote in the bus (the writing looks like a 3 year old wrote it):", "Right below it there is a drawing of a stick person flying.", "Yeah I kick ass no out (something, I can't tell what it says) read love to write it lets out emotions'", "'Me too I have the weirdest feeling ever I feel like I can just  SPLAT ! on you. If you know what I mean I don't know where to take it in. I'm trying so hard not to let it in but this is one of those things that it just comes out. Wow I haven't ever felt like this before it is strange I can't help it. I feel like I'm still on my period. I have never ever felt like this in my whole life. Maybe I'm just faking it ugh I feel like I'm this is sooo hard to try to keep it to just my self I think I'm seeing things I never had before, yeah right I'm just trying too hard. Shit but I feel it wanting to come out I'm okay this is nothing I'm just trying too hard. It's the damn bus that wont let me it's moving but see everyone else is doing fine I hate it I hate it. I can't breathe'", "You know writing this is giving me this weird sentation. But anyway.", "The trip became really bad for me because I was so paranoid. I saw Jesus. I saw little cartoon characters in the freeway. I saw many other things that I am sure I don't remember. When we were almost there, I thought I threw up so I was going all weird. I don't remember too much that happened. All I know is that my friend told me that it was all just me.  I started crying because I was feeling so sick. When I got off the bus I was asking people if they went to church and asked them to pray for me.", "Later on that day while walking around the park I wanted to call my parents and my ex-boyfriend to tell them I loved them, because I thought that was my last day alive. We only got on 2 or 3 rides because I was acting so weird. Every time I was around a group of people I started to go crazy and run out of air. All the 10-11 hours we were there seemed like 2 years for me. Also that day I felt like God was calling me to be religious. Again here is something else I wrote during the trip:", "'I feel like hell I don't know the feeling or how to describe it and hope to get out of it soon because I LOVE GOD!'", "I wish I could've written more but every time I wrote my pen was melting and my diary was sooo wet. ", "Well what I can say about my trip is that if I knew what to expect I would've enjoyed it. Maybe for a first timer I took too much or for a tiny girl like me. I am very short and weigh 95 pounds (and I'm 18, that is sad). I think I might try it some other time again. I already know what to expect and this time I will do it and stay inside doors.", "On my 19th birthday, my boyfriend (we'll refer to him as T) and I decided it was a good idea to do acid. Previous to this I had done ecstacy and marijuana (not that day-but previous in experience). I was looking forward to having the mind altering experience everyone seemed to speak so fondly of. I took it at 4:45. 45 minutes later I was having difficulty paying attention to conversation, objects and the 'voice inside my head' seemed more entertaining. He sat across from me hidden underneath the blanket. I knew I was beginning to trip because the blanket looked like a giant couch hovering above me. This made me laugh. Then the trees began to look like Magic Eye pictures, looming towards me. The Super Fly poster began to move... so we went to Gasworks (a park near the water).", "Acid was very visually pleasing, the world was beautiful. Colors became intense, vibrant shades similar to the richest shades imaginable of plants - what you'd imagine in a rainforest. At one point (when I began to peak) - a wave of color would rush across my vision, making everything that shade. However, it took a wave-like form which would only change what it touched that color. This reminded me of the beginning of the show, 'reading rainbow.' Also, I was able to pick up colors from the cement floor-of chalk written from who knows when. Everything pulsated, throbbing and waving at the same time. While staring at the ocean it seemed to create a giant wave, rising and falling, though the water was staying perfectly still. The skyline would envelope its roots, while faces and rolls danced within it. This sounds crazy, but it seems to be the only way I can explain it. It morphed and grew. I also became very confused about what country I was in. At first I thought I was in Venice!", "-while at the water, then in the tropics when viewing trees that seemed to look like palm trees.", "I felt like I was in a cave inside my brain. My ego and inhibitions regarding what I thought dropped completely. I was able to talk freely about what I sensed from T and the strangers around me. My people intuition was brutally honest, yet caring. At some point T and I were near the water where he explained how much he loved the water, boat houses, and birds. I was able to connect these three things and became T. I felt as though I were him, sensing all feelings, hopes, etc. i completely understood him, understood how others saw him, and how he saw himself. This was cool. HOwever, every girl I encountered seemed to be a bitch from hell. well, I only saw three women. 1. Cruella Deville driving behind me, sneering and shaking her head. I thought she was going to kill us. 2. Friend #1's girlfriend. She did not like us, but she later told me that she was angry about something else-so this was based in reality. However, I haven't talked to her since the trip, so I might have imagined this. 3. Friend #3's girlfriend. I swear she was crying, then being horribly rude and grouchy at T and I. I heard her say things such as, 'yeah... going there with you would be so fun' -but in a very sarcastic manner. I don't know if they were really being mean or if I imagined it. I sensed people very strongly - I related and understood - or so I think... How I saw these people and my reaction to the behavior effected me - I wanted to be the positive and steer away from what I saw as negative.", "I claim no religion and am still unsure and confused about the entire subject. However, I sensed someone... While with T at the water, I realized i was watching him and felt an assurance for him - a respect for who he was (despite my disagreements about his views) and a confidence that he would be okay in life. Then I felt someone watching me watching T -this was the higher power. Faces began to float towards me while a swivel of wind kind of did a ballerina move in the corner of my eye. It seemed to be an obvious pattern. I saw him look at me look at T, and I felt so peaceful. Later on the walk-a light came down from the skies onto a beautiful bench on campus-it was calling me to sit there. It was very spiritual.", "Acid is very cool. However, I see how some might go a little crazy afterwards. Reality is changed and you begin to wonder if what you see is really there, albeit in a different dimension. I have a profound understanding of T. At one point we were sitting across from the blank TV, and the reflection showed us in the future, sitting together in a different home. This felt peaceful, though scary because I'm 19 and that is the farthest thing from my mind. However, I was able to take this in and accept it and realize that it wasn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things. In one word-acid is truly... enlightening. I'd like to try it again , but in double dose. At 1 I drove home (not the brightest idea), but am still alive. I was still tripping. I woke up 13 hours after consuming acid, drove around again and sure enough... the colors were still slightly VIBRANT... Acid is a beautiful drug.", "This is not just one report, but a 'potted' history of my highs and lows of acid. Whether its valid or interesting or not, I don't know. . . . :)", "I first had acid at a house party with a friend, although there were a number of people there that I did not know. The night started well, and I was happily sitting on the sofa believing that I was watching an episode of 'Neighbours' (a popular Australian sitcom) when I was, in fact, looking at a picture of horses above a fireplace :) This interesting experience I interspersed with holding a burning cigarette EXTREMELY close to my eyes because the tip looked like a glowing chandelier. The only real strange part of the night was my friend claiming that she was now scared of me (she was tripping too) and hiding behind another friend, all night. However, there was a nice room to sit it, with luminous stars on the ceiling. Everything was nice, and I sat and cuddled people. :)", "Other experiences included talking to my friend about how everything was a question? This was at a festival here in England, and it was at this festival that I had my first strange (bad?) trip. Basically, I mixed it up too much, taking speed, Ecstasy and then 2 trips. I always have bad come downs on Speed, crying etc, and this was no different. However, this time the Acid gave visualisations to my depression from the coming down speed. Everyone was frightened because I wanted to 'replace their eyes with their teeth' This got to the extent that two of my friends later hid because they thought I was going to come and do something horrible to them. . . something which never crossed my mind.", "This fear motif returned later, when I was at another house party. The 'owner' of the house was in his room (busily occupied making love) and drunken people were basically messing his house up, putting Coke in the dryer etc. I got it into my mind to actually stab my best friend. I had a knife, and he looked in my eyes and ran away, quickly. The thing was that I couldn't differentiate between right and wrong, actions and consequences. Within 5 minutes, the notion had passed, and I hugged him and he stroked my hair. (We are both heterosexual males, but not fazed by things like that).", "Just to throw in some positive experiences, I remember laughing so hard because we all got leg jitters together when we all sitting down together. I remember kissing people and feeling like my kisses and my lips were shining. I remember feeling that I had tendrils coming out of my head, connecting to everyone elses head and passing love from me to everyone, and vice versa. A kind of 'Napster of Love'.", "What stopped me taking acid was when I did some White Lightnings. Whilst on this, I couldn't sleep, when everyone else was falling asleep around me. I had talked so much I had lost my voice (a common occurrence for me). This time, however, my vision was shaking, as if I was rocking my head from side to side (I probably was). In an effort to calm myself down, my friend took me to have a few hits from a bucket, but that just made me feel worse. I could only think that I was going insane on the outside, but I was sane on the inside. To everyone else, I was as mad as a hatter, but I couldn't break through the wall with my internal sanity. Eventually, I managed to go to sleep, and when I awoke completely sane, I hugged everyone around :)", "These were very isolated experiences, over two years of taking acid 3-5 times almost every week. My creativity (musical and/or otherwise) was greatly enhanced. Friends I made then I feel like I have a bond with that I could otherwise never have. The amount of times when I fell asleep feeling happier than ever far outweigh the bad times. If you're wavering about trying acid, I'd say try it in the best place you can. Remember Leary noting that you took your frame of mind into the trip, and it guided it. Surround yourself with friends, in an environment that is comfortable and familiar. It should be good. If it isn't don't do it again.", "One more thing. . . . I don't know if this is particularly relevent for countries other than Britain, but I found that certain types of Acid had slightly different effects on me. For instance, 'Strawberries' (these known by the blotter art) were the nicest, instilling me with love. On the other hand 'Jaggers' (showing a big tongue - the Rolling Stones symbol) and 'White Lightnings' (generally no blotter art) seemed to make me paranoid and a bit destructive. Has anyone else found this? In general, if I decide to continue, I try to get the same type of acid, of the same supplier if possible.", "I don't take it at the moment, but I think it's about I started again. . . . . when my brain feels flat from normality, its time to expand it again. . . . . .   ", "Take care of yourselves, and each other (where did that come from :)", "A couple days ago I came home after hanging out with my friends, and was very bored. We had had a fun time just hanging out in the playground and eating fries. During that school day I had bought two douple-dipped white mice acid tabs (the equivilant of 4 tabs). My friend who had tried the same kind and amount the previous week said he had a kick-ass trip...", "I took the a tab the moment I got home, around 9:30pm. 45 minutes later the trip had kicked in and i was feeling good. I was laying under my loft bed looking up and listening to music. The visuals were cool -- shifting wavy colors and such. My thinking was also quite strange. I only remember thinking how crazy and stupid my thoughts were. However, I wasn't flying through space quite yet. I took the next tab (and a vitamin c pill) at 10:30pm. I enjoyed the relatively weak trip another half hour and BAM!!! My mind, sense of touch and sight all shifted like crazy. I felt like I was every cell in my body, rather than a whole human being. I enjoyed it and the world became extremely trippy. It was too much to explain, but the trip was simply rising and rising... untill it went bad.", "I was focusing on my stuffed leopard and the spots starting swirling around, until they looked like little snakes biting their own tail. They were purple and green with big white eyes. They looked very cartoonish and funny. I laughed hysterically. That pattern filled my whole line of sight. And then it stopped. The visuals totally stopped. My mind was still warped so I knew I was still tripping. Then slowly, everywhere I looked, totally realistic snakes slithered out of nothingness. They were on my window, my table, my bed, my closet, the floor -- everywhere. It was like the illusion in the Craft, when she saw bugs and snakes everywhere. I hate creepy stuff, and they where all looking at me. The ones on the floor slithered toward me, while the others just curled around themselves. I could hear the hissing sound, and the rattling of rattlers.", "It was too freaky. I was scared half to death. 'How could this wonderful trip just go bad like that?' I thought. They were everywhere, even when I turned my head. Some were huge and others were tiny. My backpack became a giant snake head, and my jacket that was on the floor became a bunch of snakes, the buttons were eyes. This was too much so I closed my eyes. When I did that I saw the simple snake pattern that was on the leopard -- not scary at all. But when I opened them, the creepy ones were back. With my eyes closed (this semmed to be the only way to avoid being bitten to death) I fumbled to turn on the TV. It was about 1 in the morning and Rosanne was on (stupid show). But of course the snakes were visble out of the corner of my eyes AND they were in the show too. They were climbing onto the shelf and the people in the show.", "Well, I couldn't take it anymore, so I decided to go to bed (I figured with my eyes closed I could calm down a bit). It worked, I saw crazy hyperdimensional patterns (which I see whenever I close my eyes) -- but they were way cooler. I enjoyed this (and the weird thinking) till 4am, when I finally fell asleep. I woke up at 11am and all was normal....", "I don't know why my trip went psycho on me. It sounds really corny, but the fear I felt was undescribable. You have to have had a bad trip to understand what I went through. Oh well, I know I'm gonna do acid again, but this was my first time without e -- maybe my mind figured tripping and rolling belong together. I do advise being with friends when tripping (especially with higher doses). The morning after, I read 'Snakes everywhere, I wish my friends were here, so lonely and afraid -- 1:30pm' which I had written on a piece of paper (I obviously meant 1:30am).", "It was the last day of my junior year in high school. A bunch of us went to the park outside of town on the hill for a picnic. It was a lot of fun, romping around the playground equipment and picnic tables and playing in the grass. After a while, we split up into two groups. Five of us, me included, went exploring at a man-made stream at the edge of the park, where a cement wall created a little waterfall. The other half of our group, which included about six people, took a van to buy some food and drinks, and cigarettes if they could find someone who sold to kids under eighteen. They were gone for about two hours.", "During this time, my friend R and I roamed away from the pretty waterfall. We were going to freak out our friends my pretending to down a few pills of acid. After she went back to the waterfall, I did two hits of acid I happened to have with me but I didn't tell her about. When I came back to the waterfall, she kept asking if I really took some. I didn't say anything.", "I kept watching the water in this little creek. It was very hypnotic. And this is where it got really strange. I THOUGHT I had been watching this water the whole time, kneeling in the grass. As it turned out, I had been on one hell of a trip.", "I thought I was still watching the water when someone shook me and asked if I okay. I sat up and realised I was lying on a park swing at the OPPOSITE end of the park, almost half a mile away from the man-made creek and the little waterfall. My pant legs and shoes were soaked. The people in the van had returned. ", "They told me they'd been looking for me for over an hour, that they had panicked and were fighting and crying over whether or not to call the police. R had told everyone what she thought I did. They also said that, before I ran off in what they called a fit of ecstacy, everyone had gathered together for a group photo. I was later shown the photo, and I was in it, right in front, a big smile on my face, but I'll be DAMNED if I can remember posing for it. I still swear, to this day, that I was never in the photograph.", "I'm a fan of acid, but I still think you have to know your body well enough before trying anything. I'd done two hits before, and was confident I could handle myself. It's not that I had a bad trip or a train wreck. I simply lost ALL sense of reality. What I thought was just an hour of hypnotic staring at a stream turned out to be an hour of running around like a wild child, and eventually disappearing. I could have run onto to the highway and gotten flattened by a semi and would never have known.  I have scars and scratches and tears in my clothing from that very weird afternoon, and I don't remember getting any of them.", "This was about my seventh time Tripping on LSD. After doing many purple geltabs, which i found to be very powerful, and not tripping off the papertabs I've taken, i thought papers were useless. But I was wrong, I just hadn't found the right ones yet. That is until this weekend a month ago.  A friend of mine had a little house party in which 10-15 people come, drink, smoke some maryjane, and socialize. He throws these get-togethers often. Well.. I am 17 and was almost a full blown alcoholic, so I eased on it and got into LSD, MDMA, etc... So me, and 3 other friends decided to get some Acid, while everyone else drank. (Something we do quite often)", "Me and JB road over to a friend of his, getting a total of 20 hits. (10 were for money-making purposes to pay for ours.) This was Jonathon's first time tripping. While at the dealer's house, he specifically said, 'I don't care how much you usually take, do NoT take more than two of these.' This means alot coming from him, a daily tripper.", "Well, I'm not one to follow standards, so i took my 5. Derek took 2, and Jonathon took 1. We lost JB somewhere along the way. I went to a bedroom alone and turned on the strobe and some techno. Regular house shot mostly. I waited a half hour and just had that queezy feeling I always seem to get in my stomach before I trip. I was trying to make myself trip, by staring at things in the room hard, and zoning out(when will I learn to just sit and be patient). Well after that half hour i got up and went to the living room where everyone was watching 'body shots' a clubbin' flick. Although i didn't like this atmosphere of no music or pretty lighting effects, i layed on the floor and watched on.  Then the shit hit me so hard, I haven't ever felt like this before. For the first time in my life I got the thought for a split second, 'maybe I took a few too many'. But that thought disappeared within about a minute. Things in the house that usually only became visual for certain periods of time were constantly flowing and moving. The carpet was seemingly alive, and I found myself to be doing odd things. ", "This Acid was so different to me, It gave me a very strong body trip and mental trip, along with more visuals than the other acid I've done.  My body was feeling very weak yet so amazingly tingly. Like a shiver, but constant.  The sky became a flat purple color, and trees were flat black and cartoony. I am not used to this, but I was enjoying myself. We ended up having to leave ( drunk people need sleep) around 2am.  Driving was so scary yet completely amazing. I've ridden while tripping before, but this seemed different. We landed at an abandoned trailer on a backroad right behind a wild animal park.  The sounds of peacocks were so odd to hear while tripping.  Then my vision became completely altered, I was seeing things in like a purple writing, but shaped the way they really were supposed to be. Like comparable to the writing in the film 'MATRIX'. I was stunned, and this made me and LSD a closer companion. The night went on till about 7:30am, which started at about 11pm. The outcome was, we lost Derek along the way, and it was me and Jonathon at a gas station about 45 miles away from home. We had the ridiculous idea to follow a semi on the interstate to see where he was going.  After it war off, I had no come down, or even a burned out feel. I was amazed, and because of this I love LSD more than ever. ", "Ever since my first trip I had a different outlook on everything. Ever since this trip, I didn't have a comedown at all. So, I found a great companion.  Enjoy your LSD everyone, and please be safe. Driving is not a good idea and we shouldn't have done it. Thanks.", "Last night, a group of my frineds dropped some pretty strong acid. The acid was 'Blue Sunshine': white blotter paper with a part of a blue sun on the front with small, thin pink lines on the back. Four of my friends, J.F., D.M., C.J. and J.B. took 2, 2, 3, and 7 respectively. The two that took two said that they peaked in twenty minutes and that it was one of the most intense trips they had ever had (they are pretty experienced). The one that did 3, C.J., was passing out, curled up in a ball, and couldn't really move. He damanded that the others take him to the hospital, so they did. We think he was tied down and perhaps given thorazine (reports are uncertain). About 12 hours later, we found out that he was in a coma and that his doctors were concerned about possible heart problems. (however, someone has said that he did/was doing ice and crack, which is most likely considering the outcome).", "Now, the last is the most bizarre. He (J.B.) dropped 7 that night. Holding a knife in his hands, he calmly declared that he was going to kill himself. D.M. knocked the knife out of his hands. J.B. then stripped down to his underwear and proceeded to attack D.M. The group went and hid in D.M.'s car while J.B. curled up into a ball on the curb. He then jumped up and ran into the hills, not to be seen for the rest of the night. Talking to him today, we discovered what became of him the rest of that night (at least what he could recall). He remembered being in a tree and demanding of someone below their knives and guns. He then proceeded to the backdoor of someones house (sliding glass door). The man sitting inside looked up and was surprised to see someone in his backyard. J.B. proceeded to run/jump _through_ the glass door, into the house, cutting himself up in the process. He then demanded of the man all his knives and guns in the house. The man ran into his bedroom and locked the door. J.B. tried to knock the door down. The man called the police. ", "In the mean time, J.B. had gone into the mans kitchen. He drank some skim milk and took some pills that were laying around the house. A cop comes in, tries to restrain J.B. J.B. struggles and the cop hits him. J.B. gets angry and punches the cop, knocking him (a 6'4', 240 pound cop) to the floor. Other cops come in and start beating J.B. and spraying him with mace. They take J.B. to the hospital where he was strapped down to his bed with leather straps. When his eyes cleared from the mace, he saw a bunch of people looking over him (cops, docs, nurses, etc). He then breaks free of the straps and punches another cop. The strapped him back down and gave him a shot of thorazine, pumped his stomach, and called his parents. The man whose house he did this at is supposedly under psychological help for the trauma he recieved. The hospital reported that they had three cases that night of bad trips and labelled it 'bad acid'.", "Now, I am not using these stories to show that acid is bad. What I am saying is that you have to be careful. They were told by the person they bought it from to take no more the three, tops. They had never taken this batch of acid and didn't know its strength. They should have taken one or two to see. That and if they were going to push it, they should have had a sober, experienced person to help if things get tough. Acid is powerful stuff. Be very aware. Use common sense. And watch out, this batch is potent.", "I had gotten hold of some acid from an acquaintance of mine and decided to share it with some friends I knew had been looking for it for some time.  K. and I had both tripped twice before (both of mine were pleasant, and mild).  C. had never done acid, and he decided to try it.  We each took an initial dose of blotter paper, before deciding to get our hands on some more from the same supplier.  By that time, J. and B. joined in and we had a group of five.  The stage was set as I began to feel the effects first....", "As I said before, both of my previous trips had been pleasant, mild and solitary.  This was truly about to be a great experience--the shared one.  I was also excited for C., as it was his first time.  As the drug took hold of all of us, I could feel the energy level of the whole group rising and flowing in an indescribably free and encompassing manner.  The physical sensations I had were somewhat more intense than before:  I would even compare them in a small way to the effects of Ecstasy, which I have done once.  Anyway, we all talked and laughed and I could honestly feel everyone else's thoughts and energy.  It was absolutely beautiful, as if we were all walking through some bizarre Narnia together.", "Eventually, J. and B. both left, leaving K., C. and me to continue our journey together.  We alternated between the front yard (definitely a dark night, with the street lights adding an eerie glow to everything) and the living room with Pink Floyd and a lava lamp.  No matter what we were looking at, we all saw the same thing:  the street oozing, the ceiling sliding, the carpet flowing, trees melting--WOW!!!  I had never seen anything more beautiful in my life.  The shared experience was the closest I have ever come to feeling at one with my surroundings.  The life around us just flowed and pulsated and caressed me in a way that I can never hope to describe.  C. was just in heaven, and we were so happy for him.  The sunrise was a truly cosmic experience.  None of us felt any ill effects, save the drained feeling that comes at every trip's end.  Furthermore, the three of us connected on a level which can never be expressed in words.  We just look at each other, remember, and understand.  Damn, what a feeling.", "My experience with LSD occurred several years ago.  I grew up in a very Christian family, but being new to a college environment I was more than curious about several drugs.  I have a somewhat addictive personality, and have enough friends in the drug scene to know that I could easily get caught up.  In spite of this, I wanted to try a substance which alter normality without leaving me with a feeling that I wanted more.  ", "I decided that I would trip once, and then hope my experience wasn't overcoming.  I arrived at a party on Halloween night.  The majority of the invited guests were on one drug or another, and I decided that this would be my chance.  Several friends had access to acid, so I decided to give it a shot.  I was also drinking, so it hard to say when the effects first hit, but within about an hour, I noticed that my perception of reality began to change.  My experience is less like others.  Although I had some visual effects such as tracing with cigarettes, by and large I noticed few visual effects.  The other effects were awesome.  The entire room took on a persona of its own, and I had an overpowering desire to take everything in.  I noticed a pentagram on the wall, something which would have floored me before, but I just sat there staring at it for what must have been 20 minutes.  ", "We left, soon after, and went to another party.  There was a huge bonfire and my friends and I spent about an hour just staring into the middle of the fire.  Everything seemed to slow down and I found the effects humorous.  I was up almost the entire night, unable to sleep until around 9:30 the next morning (almost 12 hours after I took only 1 hit).", "Certainly when you take any drug, you are taking a chance with negative side effects.  I must admit that my experience with LSD was quite enjoyable, but I have never had a desire to try it again.  It was a fun evening, and I highly recommend that if you are thinking about doing it (or any other drug) you consider the possible consequences and put yourself in a safe environment.", "10 of us, all young men ranging from 17 to 19 decided to pitch a tent in a small nature preserve, set like an island in the middle of inner-city life. This island served as a great source for experimentation of all kinds and a place to commune with nature. It also made for a fairly safe place for a first acid experience. As I think back to it as a man in his 40's I gain new insights all the time. It was an experience I will never forget or regret.", "We pitched the tent and started a fire and dropped. My dose was 1/2 tab orange sunshine( a saccarine sized barrel of orange color). $3.00 a hit. The only other things with us where a radio and a pack of cards. We sat inside the tent at dusk and began to attempt to play cards waiting for it to kick in. There where 2 of us who had tripped once or twice before..the other 8 first timers. I remember Dave one of the 'experienced' one's saying things like ' Whats the matter? Are you f**ked up' purposely making his voice sound like a slowed down tape. Everyone laughed at that. The funny thing was...his voice still sounded like that after he had begun a normal discussion with his normal voice. The climb to the peak had begun for me. After a few tries, we all realized playing cards was not an option because the numbers and suits where indecipherable we began flinging cards at each other acrossed the tent, watching the trails and laughing hysterically. ", "I fell back trying to duck a card and felt my head hit the radio. Ouch! I sat back up, put my hand to my head and then looked at it. Blood! I started freaking out 'My heads bleeding' I shouted. Everyone looked quickly at me in horror. I was staring at my hand that was full of crimson wetness that oozed around as though it was alive and I felt a sense of panic growing. A voice( not sure who's) said laughing 'your not bleeding!'. The blood in my hand faded away and so did the pain in my head. I wasnt. Few! This instance however..set the tone for my complete trip as I got this notion of how vulnerable we all where now. For the rest of the night I was like everyones mother which I'm sure was a drag for everyone else. ' Be careful! Don't do this! Don't do that!' My consern grew worse as a few decided to run out on the major highway, laydown in the middle and wait for cars...then jump up and run! I was freaking on that enough where they stopped, after calling me some choice expletives. Maybe I saved a life? Who knows? :)", "A curious thing happened that I do remember. Because of the close proximity we all had inside this tent/cocoon we all experience pretty much the same trip..purely by a verbal cue from someone else. ' Look! He has an eye in his forehead' as we all ooohed and aaahed at the same sight. Another was the power of the sense of smell. David was sitting in the middle of the tent..lighting matches and looking at them until they burned out and then lighting more. The smell of sulfur permeated the tent air. I shouted ' Don't do that you'll start the tent on fire!' As I was finshing that thought/sentence an orange glow lit up the outside of the tent and I heard what sounded like flames burning and crackling wood.  We where surrounded by fire! I thought. Another tripper stuck his head out of the flap after I shouted ' The woods are on fire'! He looked around outside, stuck his head back in with a goofy grin and said ' No its not'. Instantly the glow and noise stopped. It was a long strange trip that night...I could be keep writting...but I dont want to take up to much space. Laughing leaves, primitive chants around the campfire, crumbling glass like leaves in my hand, pulling space bugs from my mouth, incredible fractal images and colors etc. It was all mind opening and altering...and def scary. But not enough to scare me from tripping again. The first time though was the most intense and memorable of all trips.", "It was a friday night and after my friend and I had gotten back home, we decided to trip.  Well, actually we had decided to two days ago, but that was just the point-of-no-return per se.  Anyway, I had 3 hits in my posession.  1 white blotter with a star on it, and two sweet tarts that had had liquid lsd dripped onto them.  Around 12 I took the white blotter and my friend took one sweet tart.  We waited, and waited, and waited for what seemed like forever.  ", "My friend mentioned that he was hungry and so we decided to get some midnight snacks.  We went into my kitchen and made some popcorn and sandwiches.  For some odd reason i started staring at the popcorn and when i realized that i had been staring at the popcorn for some time, i realized that my friend was not in the kitchen anymore.  So, out of fear that my parents or younger sibling would discover him tripping balls, I started whispering out his name, and after what seemed like an eternity of searching i found him standing in front of a mirror in my entry-hall and all he said was look at the mirror.  Now this is probably my only regret of the night, however, I have grown from this mistake and I am sure that it is only specific to me, but I decided to look in the mirror.  It was AMAZING, my face suddenly became nothing and then was immediately an 'aliens' head (those grey ones that are commonly depicted on TV).  This scared the crap out of me.  So my friend and I decided it would be best to go back into my room.  ", "I felt extrememly uneasy and anxious almost paranoid.  I decided to get on IRC and talk to some 'experts' I knew.  As indicated by a so-called 'expert' i started watching Tom and Jerry.  My friend started laughing his balls off, while I could only think of how bad it must be to be the little mouse helpless to such a predator as a large cat.  However, again this i believe is only specific to me and furthermore sprouted from an incident that occurred only a month before.  Anyway i felt that what i needed to do was just lay down and relax and listen to some music.  So I got in my bed and realized that it would all be over soon and that i should just enjoy it while i could. So I just relaxed and listened to some Bob Marley and closed my eyes and looked at all the patterns and amazing visuals that I was seeing.  There were so many that I cannot remember them all, however, there are two that stuck out in my mind.  One occurred after my friend had insisted on turning out the lights and turning off the TV.  I was staring at my wall and noticed how it looked almost like liquid, so I decided to touch it and when I did, it rippled and some of the 'liquid' came off on my hand and quickly started engulfing my entire hand, I loved this, it was right out of the matrix.  Another wonderful visual that I experienced was when I suddenly felt this urge to stare at my fingers.  My index and middle finger suddenly turned into cartoon baby blue-jay's. ", "Contradictions and Additional Notes:  I forgot to mention that around 12:45 after feeling no significant effect, i took the third sweet-tart.  And also, my 'friend' who I was with insisted on turning out the lights and TV, which pissed me off, but because of the fear of inducing a 'bad trip' i didn't argue.", "About a week after Christmas break, a friend of mine gave me 2 hits of acid left over from New Year's Eve because I had given him some codeine.  I had fried twice before and had done plenty of research on acid so I was somewhat familiar with what I was getting myself into.  My second trip involved me feeling so depressed and lonely that I wanted to kill myself.  I was alone at that time, so I made sure that I would always be around someone for this trip.", "I took the first hit around 6:45 pm that Friday.  After about 45 minutes I felt kind of giddy but I wasn't getting any visuals.  I went with a couple friends to get something to eat.  At this point I noticed that colors were getting brighter.  Knowing that this acid was old, I decided to take the second hit around 8 pm.  I went in another friend's room and listened to Tool.  I love listening to music when I fry.  It feels like I am part of the music and it defines everything I do and think.  I started to get the typical colors forming on walls and peoples' faces starting to look weird. ", "I went with my friend to a frat house so he could get drunk for his birthday.  We stayed there for about 3 hours.  I had some cool visuals.  We went back to the dorm around 12:30 am.  When we got inside the dorm I felt like I was in a video game.  Everything looked bright and artificial.  I had auditory hallucinations and all the sounds sounded like they were in surround sound. ", "Then I went up to my floor and went to the room next to mine and talked to a few friends who were hanging out.  We started talking about acid and one stupid guy says 'You realize you can get permafry from one hit of acid, right?'  That officially ended my good trip.  After that I started getting scared that I was never going to come down.  I walked to another friend's room who had experience with acid and I knew he would be a good person to talk to.  ", "I felt terrible.  I was extremely scared.  I thought I was going crazy and would never be sane again.  The worst part was that I coulnd't communicate to others how scared I was.  The knew I was on a bad trip but they didn't know how bad it was.  I went outside with some guy to smoke a cigarette.  He had fried many times, so he tried to calm me down.  He talked about what he liked to do when he was frying.  It helped a little.  I looked over at the snow and it was a pale yellow color and it started running around on the ground.  I felt like I was peaking again.", "I went up to this guy's room.  He gave me a blowpop which was very fun to chew on because of all the tension in my jaw, but I was still scared shitless.  I felt like my heart was going to pound out of my chest.  I asked the guy if I would be able to go to the hospital without getting in trouble with the cops.  I thought about how my life would be if I never came down and how my family and friends would react.  My mind was racing so fast, but it was the same cycle of thoughts over and over.  I could not get my heart to stop pounding.  I was panicking.  I felt like I was living a thousand eternities every second and in every eternity I died and was reborn.  Thats as close as I can get to describing how I felt.  I knew that if I could fall asleep I would hopefully be able to sleep until I had come down.  But every time I closed my eyes I felt like I was sinking into the floor.  That wasn't scary but it was annoying and kept me from sleeping.  I call this the scariest three hours of my life because I have never been as scared as I was between 1 and 4 am that morning.    ", "Knowing I wasn't going to sleep I just started walking around.  I had calmed down a little by this point, but I was still kinda scared.  I walked around drinking water and pissing, looking at things on the wall, looking out windows.  The sun came up and I was still walking around.  I went outside and walked around.  Finally around 8 am, I went up to my room and went to sleep.  ", "I woke up three hours later.  I still felt a little bit of the effects.  I felt like I had died and been born again.  I walked outside and the air tingled on my skin.  The sound of cars driving by was incredible.  Everything felt so fresh and alive.  I still had difficulty thinking straight, but by that night I could think fine again. ", "If anything, this experience taught me that maybe acid is not the drug for me.  I like frying and think it is very fun, but I seem to end up having bad experiences.  I naturally have an anxiety-prone mind.  Maybe that has something to do with it.  If I ever drop again, it probably won't be for at least a year, that is if I ever do it again.  Acid is a very powerful drug that really fucks up your mind.  It even has the potential to make permanent changes in someone who takes it.  Anyone considering dropping needs to realize this and know what they are getting themselves into.", "Well, I have had many friends that were users of the drug for quite some time. From each person I had heard mixed things: 'It was the worst time of my life!', 'It was like my eyes were open for the first time.' etc. I had decided to abstain from the use of any synthetic drug, for fear of the 'side affects', but this did not last long. The older I got and the more experienced I became with herbals the more my curiosity began to peak. Eventualy I just said 'LSD is something I would like to experience once in my life.'. When I expressed these feelings to a close friend of mine, Myles, he said 'Want company?'. So began our adventure.", "After searching for months we finally found some I purchased 2 hits and Myles got 1. We promptly headed back to his house for a night of fun. ", "We ate the hits at about 10:00 pm and then comfortably settled down to watch some Dragon Ball Z. About 1 hour later my skin began to tingle and I begin to get very giggly. Myles was becoming concerned that his was not gonna work. I excused myself to the bathroom to inspect my goosebumbs and when I returned I found Myles laughing like a small school girl.", "This kept up for a good 2 hours, then it was if I had blinked and the entire world as I knew it melted away and revealed its true nature to me. I was completly aware of *everything* around me, reminicent of a comic book superhero.", "After playing around with my new found super senses, we decided to go outside. In mid Montana there are no lights, no neighbors, and no one to interfere with my new found plans of world domination. For reasons that are still unclear, just as you know the sky is blue and the grass is green there was no doubt in my mind it was *FACT* that the next day I was going to take over the world, this made me very excited... ;P", "The problem I found with the substance was that it made me go to the bathroom excesivly!! So....now I'am sitting in the silence of a bathroom attempting to make some since of my new found awareness when I noticed a small hand towel hanging from the wall, the towel had been given life! I sat there for what seemed hours watching this towl, which I had given the name Bob, breathe and grow before my eyes. The sudden knock on the door snaped me back into what little bit of the real world I still had left in me, so I finished me buisness, introduced Myles to my new friend Bob.", "We thought it would be interesting to lay in the complete dark and talk about life. Laying in the dark with my best friend (and Bob the towel which made for a nice pillow) was the most relaxed I have ever been. Our bodies ceased to exist instead we were two voices in an empty room nothing more. I began to question weather or not anything at all existed outside of the closed door of his room. I questioned myself and my actions and found a peace the likes of which I have never known....", " We sat in the dark and talked until the sun beat down on the window of his room like a rentless messenger reminding us of the world and the reality we had left and were well on the way back to.", "I hope my story can be of help to someone if not more than a humerous distraction from homework.", "I started doing lsd at the age of 13. I am now 15. I know in your article it said you were also 15. I know what your talking about I havent done lsd in over half a year. I too wake up morning after morning with tracers..confusion..slight visuals..And not to mention slight problems with everyday activity. my freinds see me different.", "i see me different. And thats the worst part. My freinds make me feel stupid alot. They constantly poke fun at my stupidity. And take advantage of my gulability. I sometimes stare off into nothing. But it has its good points. I see things in a different way. I watch my self not to poke fun at others. I feel im a better person. And i realise my flaws more. When i see people now. That i have made fun of before. I think about how mean i was to them. I have apologised for alot of things ive done wrong. But i think lsd has caused me to learn a think or two..and maybe even a few morals. ", "I wrote this to tell you not to worry. Youll be ok. Its all a mindframe. Or something like that. Im not to good on termanology. But i also have freinds that have the same problem. Some worse then mine. But im not that bad off. Its only a slight difference. But i have a different mind set. To anyone reading this. I wouldnt recomend doing lsd if you havent already.", "Once upon a time, my boyfriend and I took 2 stamps (blotter hits) each for the first time. After one hour we still did not feel anything so we each decided to take another stamp.", "After about one and a half hours sounds around us were starting to change. They were heard more intensely than before, our eye focusing changed and our legs started to feel like they were made of elastic, accompanied by an uneasy feeling in the stomach. On top of that we felt as if we were being watched and heard by someone. We tried to watch the movie. But no success. Suddenly the telephone rang. I staggered over, picked it up and all I could hear was a strange buzz on the other end.", "By this time, the feeling of nausea, the limpness of our bodies and the change in sight, hearing, thinking, smelling and tasting really started to get to us seriously. My boyfriend felt pretty uneasy at the thought of how strong the effects would eventually be, and where it was gonna lead us. We decided to walk a bit around the house and everything we looked at, walls, ceilings, our faces, began to come alive, as if everything surrounding us, even the air we breathed, was covered with an amazingly colourful energy field composed of extraordinary vivid colours of sparkling green, purple and blue, like millions of pieces of glitter, all radiant and moving, constantly changing everything into living energy forms.", "We walked towards the bedroom to lie down, hoping the strange feeling in our bodies would go away. Lying on the bed, we closed our eyes. I felt great and excited over my new state of mind. Believe it or not, when my attention shifted to my boyfriend's emotional state I could actually feel the essence of his deepest fear. He was so frightened for what he was momentarily experiencing, that he thought the hand of the devil tried to grab his heart right through the mattress to pull him down. I wrapped my arms around him and comforted him that there was no need to be frightened. That he should let go of that fear and that he should to try to surrender to this new state and perceptions.", "Then something astonishing happened to us. As soon as we closed our eyes again, something pulled us out of our bodies and we were literally launched into the skies, like a rocket, right through the roof of our appartment into the vastness of  what appeared to be the actual universe itself. Together we flew with the speed of light through this immense black space and it felt like we were one with all the stars and planets and all that surrounds them. We could not see our bodies, we spoke through our thoughts to each other whilst travelling from one planet to the other. During this trip we searched for the meaning of life and while trying to find the essence of it, we read each other?s thoughts as we travelled together, side by side, from planet to star, from star to planet and back. It was as though we were one.", "We were searching for the big Truth out there, and we finally arrived at the Unbearable Truth, unfolded Naked, in front us and part of us, namely that in this large black Universe, we were just a tiny little molecule forming parts with other molecules, forming a bigger part of larger parts and so on. Being one with the grandeur of Nature and Life, and at the same time even tinier than the smallest dot on a piece of paper. This really blew our minds out. ", "Finally at dawn, we came back to earth. We were pulled back into our bodies with a speed you cannot imagine. It felt like we had travelled in space for only one hour, at the most.", "We found it difficult afterwards to fully comprehend. We were in a state of shock, I can tell you that, hardly able to speak with reason.", "I had done acid once before, but I had only taken one hit the first time and didn't really get much out of it, so I thought I would try  two this time. Around 7pm me and a few other friends each took our one hit and sat around watching tv waiting for the acid to kick in. After about an hour we hadn't felt anything but a slight high, so we decided to take another one. We sat in a friends bedroom and all of a sudden it was like everything around were just the fuuniest things ever...It felt like we had sat there for hours just laughing continuously about nothing. After about what was really 30 mintues I was starting to  really feel it, and I was looking at my friend when she told me the bed was breathing...and I thought she was crazy, but it actually was and then everything around us started to breath and we looked over at this plastic chair and there was a water fall running down it. Then me and my friend H were looking at Bs feet and they started to swell up and we could see the blood going through her feet, so that really scared us and we all decided that we had to all have socks on because it was just to sick to look at anymore. Our friend T who hadn't taken anything decided we needed to go get a movie,  we all piled into her truck and drove to the movie store. On the way there I  had brought my toothbrush and started brushing my teeth and it was the most awsome feeling ever. ", "after we got a movie we had planned on going over to T's brothers house so she could get some alchohol. On the way back to her house we decided to call a friend and see if he wanted to hang out, he had asked us to come over. Since T wanted to drink I decided that I was ok to drive. I still don't really understand how we made it there because one min. we were at her house and the next we were across town. When we got into his house he told us he was going to go get some food and be right back and for us to just stay there. It seemed like he was gone for hours but it had to only be 20-30 mintutes. We sat in the living room and watched tv some more when all of a sudden I jumped up and decided that I didn't like the way his house felt and that it was making me sick looking at everything mutate. I walked into the kitchen hoping it would fade away and I could just go back and watch tv, only it got worse and I kept saying I just wanted it all to stop and that C needed to come back to his house. I walked around in circles feeling fine one secound and the next I was scared and wanted to go home...and then the next secound I thought I was going to die, because I felt like my insides were falling out and they were going to be aten away by  bugs. ", "I thought maybe if I went back into the kitchen and got some water I would be fine, but The water only seemed to make it worse and it all hurt more. My friends just kinda looked at me like they  didn't know what to do. Then I thought I would just go lay down and fall asleep, no way was that going to happen. When I layed down I really felt like everything was being draind from my body and i was getting really scared. We all decided that it was the house and that we just needed to leave. B took me to my car so we could figure out if it was me or just the house. We sat in my car and i was feeling all better and then C came home and came out to the car to see what we were doing and tell us to come back inside. I decided that I was fine to go back inside untill I got inside and he had brought a bunch of people over. Me and B just decided to go upstairs away from them and talk. When I felt like I was going to die again. We went back down stairs and told H and T that we had to go back to T's house. ", "Walking out to the car everyone had felt like the house made them sick. We got in the car and everyone said they felt so much better in the car than the house. I don't remember the drive back to T's house, but somehow we made it. When we walked into the house I soon felt the feeling like i was going to just die AGAIN and  told them to take me to the hospital because I was really dieing. They both just looked at me like I was crazy so  then I  thought if I went into the bathroom and I came  back out and I'd be fine...well the bathroom wasnt the place. The walls in the shower were marble and they keept changing colors and the flowers on the floor were dancing around and the walls were sweating. I was feeling really sick looking at all this so I went back into the room and tried to lay down  but the pain of my insides being ripped out returned. ", "I thought that maybe if I called someone that was sober they could talk to me and tell me  that I wasnt dieing. I called my ex bf  because I thought that only him or my  mom could make everything  go away and I'd be better again, but he wasn't home.  B called her bf since he does this alot he might be able to help us. He was no help. I made several trips to the bathroom thinking I would feel better in there. I tired to explain to H what  I was feeling and I guess I really scared her and she started crying. After awhile we all sat on the bed and me and H were crying and laughing so hard we didn't know if we were happy, sad, scared, tired, etc. About 30 min. of that we were all feeling alot better and decided to go upstairs and get some food. We came back down and ate and talked about what all had happend and why it was happinging. ( we really got no where) around 4am I finally got a hold of my ex bf and talked to him for a few minutes and just talking to him made me feel like I was ok and I could go to sleep. We all fell asleep around 5.", "So that was the whole trip in short. It started off great and soon turned into the worst thing I have ever felt. I don't know  what made it all go down hill so fast, but I think it was the change of atmosphere and the mood that C put us all in. I don't think I'll stop acid, but I will always remember this and REALLY hope it never happens again.", "This is an account of what was the worst trip of my life. I went to a rave with a friend. On the line to get in, we were chatting with this kid from Ohio who had geltabs for sale. I indicated that I wanted to purchase, but should wait until we get inside. After we got in, I found my new friend and paid him for two black gels. This kid wasn't very slick, he sat down in a corner and took out a rather large sheet of geltabs. Having never taken geltabs before, but having used paper 9-10 times, I thought that I could handle two. All of a sudden, a cop started walking straight in our direction.  The dealer, who was tripping freakin' nuts, rips a good amount of that sheet and shoves it in my hands. I immediately threw it into my mouth and swallowed it. ", "After about 20 minutes, it started coming in heavy. REAL heavy. I went to the chill area to eat a pretzel and drink an iced tea. I couldn't swallow the pretzel and would spit it out into my hand. I was then talking to this guy from NYC named Vic, who asked me how much acid I took. I said that I probably took about 9 or 10 doses at once, and that I was freaking out hard.", "After that, I went to the stands and had a seat, eating a giant pixy stick and smoking a cigarette, because I was tripping far too hard to be dancing or anything. I then blacked out.", "The next few hours are a muddle...I don't remember much other than screaming 'Kill me' to the nurses, taking a leak, or knocking over some no doubt expensive piece of machinery.", "I awoke the next day still tripping. This time is still a muddle...I don't remember much because it was so fucking wierd and beyond my comprehension. I don't know whether I was dreaming or conscious. I stared at my hands for what seemed like hours, and the doctors and nurses made fun of me. ", "Next memory was me awakening in a different room a completely changed person. I could tell.  My mom had to drive an hour and a half in late June to come pick me up from the hospital. I have never seen her so angry in my entire life.", "The Tuesday after, I had appendicitis and went to the hospital, where I stayed until Friday.", "The flashbacks never stopped until about two months after that bad experience. Everything triggered them, from just staring at my hands in a certain way to hearing certain phrases.", "I will never take acid again, and I am glad for this. I was (and still am, after five months of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication), at least a little, cut off from reality.", "The moral of this story is to ALWAYS look at what you buy before shoving it in your mouth.", "My friend and I consider ourselves experienced trippers to some degree or another, even spiritual if you will. We often would sit in my well designed basement bedroom, 'the acid room,' and trip for hours on end listening to goa. This is a most stimulating experience in itself, to listen to one of the most auditorily challenging music styles on the planet. This isn't any kind of techno, however; it is a very spiritual and influencing sound. ", "One day I decided to indulge on my own, which I really do enjoy at times. I took 2 blotters, which I secured from a rave a few day earlier. The acid began to take effect and let down its unrelenting power upon my willful mind. General color pattern changes and breathing and molding occured. I sat and watched a candle move around for quite a while.", "I proceeded then in my peak to smoke a bowl or two of some good commercial and increase the auditory stimulation and reception of my mind. So there I lay on my couch between 4 three-foot three-way speakers and two tweeters, which created an enviroment with awesome surround sound. All was normal until the weed kicked in. Directly across from me there was a black light illuminating the room and lighting a Hebrew eye chart across from me and a few irridescent things in that area of the room. To give a short idea of what this room looks like, imagine half of a normal sized basement, a speaker in every corner, and on both concrete walls there were complete black light hand paintings I did that have UNINTENTIONAL 'hidden pictures' in them, which my friend pointed out for me.  One is quite impressive, it's a lake reflecting green hills and a mountain of volcanoes and it looks real only under the black light (painted in white light, mind you).", "So here I was in the center of this room staring at the wall with my favorite techno dj tape on (dan efex:protocols) and the moment it started I felt as though I was being pulled further and further away. When I finally looked at what I was seeing, I realized I was looking out of my face as if I was seeing through the holes of my eyes, nose and mouth. Eventually I was no longer there at all. The experience itself remains somewhat of a mystery, but  I do know that I attained knowledge, memories and life experiences of someone else which I knew of when it happened but the setting of this out of body experience was completely foreign to me, out of this world. I highly recommend to all those people out there who are into experience, find Hallucinogen:the lone deranger, or something known as GOA trance, and take a listen while in a good LSD/marijuana state and you will understand what I mean. Salvia is next on my list so expect to hear from me again.", "I myself had taken LSD many times in high school but this report is about a friend who took some unwittingly. He was with my step-brother at a concert when the cute chicks behind them offered them some orange koolaid. My step-brother was an experienced LSD user and should have known better than to let his unexperienced friend drink the obviously spiked beverage. ", "They were both flying high by the time they got home. My step-brother was enjoying himself, knowing what to expect, but our friend definitely was not. We tried to calm him and let him know he was safe and among friends but he kept rocking back and forth and could not relax. One of the things he blurted out was that he was gay. We were his friends and suspected as much and since we loved him it didn't matter and we told him so. We phoned his brother to come get him but he didn't want to be moved. He became slightly violent but with our loving effort he went home. ", "We all saw him a couple of days later. He seemed a little embarassed but otherwise OK. This is not as an anti-LSD message (as I believe the things I learned while tripping are invaluable to this day), but rather as a testament to the power of friendship and love even in the most frightening of circumstances. Also, never give someone LSd without their consent!", "to begin, i am a very experienced user of acid. i recreationally use lsd to explore other dimensions and secluded mindsets which i believe the brain hides because mankind isn't civilized enough to comprehend these thoughts and feelings.  i dosed at approximately 11 am. at approximately 11:45 i began to feel the rising effects, slight disembodiment, confusion, trails, bright colors, etc.  i had a sitter, also a very experienced tripper, and he was only baked.  to make a very long and sensual trip into a beautiful universe short, the most vivid memory of the trip was the first valley after a frenzy.  i looked at my hand because i was instructed to do so by a very bright, ambient color changing figure i later found to be my lava lamp, but as i opened my hand i felt a rush of perfection and i still to this day believe that what i felt and saw in my hand, was the entire universe expanding and showing me its secrets.  each time i try to describe what i felt at that moment i almost cry.  it is to this day the most beautiful thing i have ever felt.", "please know yourself enough to handle the drugs you choose.", "Now, I had tripped once before in my life but it was probably real weak acid, I had 1 1/2 hits and felt nothing but a light headed feel, a real base-line effect. My friend jack had gotten hold of three microdots for the weekend and he invited myself and our friend dave to trip with him (me and dave had both shared our rather weak first experience). Jack was a tad more experienced in the ways of class a drugs than us although we all are regular pot heads and not shy of popping pills when the chance arises. ", "Anyway, we had got hold of our trips and decided to go to our mates house (pete) to ingest them. Jack told us that it wouldn't be wise to drop so early in the evening (it was 4.00pm) cos we would be flying when the rest of civilisation was still active. I thought 'fuck that, I wanna trip!' and dave agreed so we ended up taking them about 5.00pm. Now I thought that if the first trip was anything to go by I would be able to handle everyday situations quite easily (I had made arrangements to see my girlfriend that evening) so I thought we would drop, go round my girlfriends house, come up and be back at petes house before it started peaking and get out of hand. Pete and his flatmates, who I wasn't too familiar with, started their evening of getting heavily stoned so I thought it would be rude to leave so early after getting there so I stayed for a few spliffs. 5.20pm (20 minutes after dropping) I felt strangely inhibited but I couldnt tell if I was just stoned or if I was coming up. ", "About 10 minutes later I found myself to be staring at a rug in the corner of the room, it seemed to be 'breathing' as if it had a life of its own, this facinated me and it took me a while to come to terms why I was looking at a rug, pete was looking at me smiling (they know all about acid) about 5.40pm we all decided to go down the chippy and get dinner, although I was in no mood for eating, we left the house and walked down the high street by this time I was for lack of a better word fucked, I felt as if I had dropped a couple of pills I had the energetic feel of beans and I noticed that my visuals were distorting, lampposts were swaying very gently as if hanging in the breeze and the pavement in front of me was a myriad of weaving lines that threatened to trip me up if I wasn't careful, goddamn! These dots are nothing like the shitty blotters I had before, this was madness and I had to take the drivers seat..by the time we got to the chippy me and dave we jabbering about getting some mdma, this was the best idea in the world and no one could tell us otherwise, 'snap out of it, you've taken microdots, you dont know whats gonna happen, give it time'.", "Pete and co. Went in the chippy while me jack and dave waited outside, jack started staring at a nokia mobile advertisment on the wall, the one with the ketchup seemingly sprayed all round the edges of it. The first thing I thought was 'fuck me theres a girl in that wall and shes covered in sauce, no it cant be it is! Its actual sauce on that there wall' I went in close and had a real good look, nope its just and advertisement but the light its emmiting is the dopest thing I've ever seen. By this time pete had been in the chip shop for what seemed like hours and was cracking up at our antics outside, we left eventually and made our way back to the house, by this time I felt the acid getting stronger and stronger, I found myself on a sofa in the house attempting to get a cigarette from my packet, it took goddamn hours and I wondered if I was just stupid, this was the simplest task ever and I found myself to be incapable of performing it! This sent me off on tangents, did I do well at school? Did my mum bring me up well enough? Why cant I do this? Whats wrong with me? Oh shit...reality flashback, I had to tell myself that I felt like this because of the drugs I had ingested, then everything became a hellava lot clearer. 'Hold on, I dont have to worry about this, I can control whats happning, I just have to realise it' this got me thinking about how the drug was working in my brain, ", "I closed my eyes and eye could visualise my thought patterns flowing freely from thought to thought, I could see if anything bad happened it would make a blockage in my flow of thought and it would keep building up and building up and cause me to get bogged down on that individual bad thought, I just had to learn to 'let it all go' so to speak. I felt as if I had a major break-through and I was just about to tell everybody about it but had to restrain myself 'what the hell would everyone think if I blurted out all the shit thats been going through my head for the last god-knows-how-long, ill be a goddamn laughing stock, well maybe..eh? Who are these people? I cant remember any of petes flatmates names..' looked over at dave at man, he was having a real bad one, shit, he looked so down I couldn't believe it..hmm he would be the one that I would save, by passing on my new found knowledge of LSD I would turn his bad trip to a good one just like I did, time to talk... 'Err we are going out for a bit, umm come on...jack and d..dd..ave' ", "Me: 'uhh to get my bag' (I had left it round jacks house)", "When we got out of the house I had no idea where I was in relationship to anything, I knew the road but where the fuck did it lead??!! Which way is north?? Godammit... I went blank and we walked towards jacks house we went in silence before I remembered what the hell I had came out here for, right time to let dave know the truth..", "Me: 'right, the thoughts in your head, they build up like stacks and stacks and keep building and they could be bad but let em go'", "He had a point what the fuck was that? I made no sense and seemed to be confusing myself and dave so much more than we originally were.", "I would leave it at that and I would try to explain later when I didn't feel so fried, 'how long does this shit last anyway?'", "Bloody hell I feel as if I've been tripping for days this stuff is insane, keep going, ride the trip out, remember what you've learned before...let it all go, yeah, thats right.", "11.00pm the prospect of being out at this time when the pubs were being turned out was terrifying we couldnt get my bag from jacks house because he wouldn't let us go back for fear of his parents we decided to go back to petes after a very pointless walk,still, the tracers were interesting. It was at this point when dave decided to talk for the first time it was quite relieving to hear his voice cos I was beginning to think he was braindead he said he was having a real bad trip and I told him to remember that it was only down to the drugs why he felt like this I told him to let it all go again (sounding like a damn broken lp) and he simply just looked confused there was no getting through to this boy, although someone on acid trying to explain their thoughts to another person on acid is the most futile thing ever. We ended up at petes house again after walking what felt like miles and miles (actual distance - 1/2 mile)", "Back at petes house I was incapable of speech although I crafted a very fine spliff which I was incredibly proud of..then the bombshell hit, I was supposed to see my girlfriend hours ago!! This was bad, shes gonna dump me, im unreliable, im a bad person etc...more acidy thoughts blowing things out of all proportion, calm. Think. Forget thats better.. The rest of my trip was incredibly pleasant after I finally managed to handle myself and things were quite good really.", "1. Location - v.important, find a free house for a couple of days, giving enough time to trip and comedown, parents coming home while tripping is a recipe for disaster", "2. Know who you trip with - things can get real sketchy if your not sure about the people you are hanging around with it can turn a normal situation into a real surreal experience", "3. For the comedown have lots of pot to smoke or alcohol, sleep is good after an acid trip I hate just sitting around, exhausted after the drug has ebbed away", "4. Remember anything that happens is only down to the drug remember that you are in the driving seat, you just have to realise it.", "I tried LSD for the first time at age 14.  Peer pressure was the reason for doing so.  I was with friends at a party and took the hit.  After about an hour I was feeling a bit anxious and jittery and I noticed my visual perception was heightened as well as my hearing.  It seemed like I could here someone sneeze from a block away.  It was interesting to look at things and laugh at everything.", "After about two and a half hours I started feeling really wierd and warm.  I was soaked in sweat and started taking my shirt off and pants off in the middle of winter,(i am in canada so it's cold here), without having any sensation of being cold what so ever.  I thought the sweat was rain and it felt like summertime.", "Then I started feeling very intensly paranoid.  Everybody was staring at me and watching what I was doing.  I thought my friends were whispering bad things about me.  I even thought people in cars driving by knew I was on acid.  I was panicking very badly and didn't trust anyone I was with.  I felt hopeless and out of control.", "I felt like I was going crazy and the feeling or highness was never going to end.  It seemed like it was going to last forever.  At the time this feeling was the most horrible experience I had ever felt in my life.  Everything that I looked at seemed magnified and distored.  I looked at my face and eyes in a mirror and panicked because  my eyes seemed to be floating in different directions and I could see every impurity and pore so intensly in my skin, and every little sound seemed so intense.(ie, water dripping from a tap).  I was fearful, hopeless, nervously shaking and almost called an ambulance to come and take me to the hospital.", "I tried to stay calm but everything I looked at seemed as if it was breathing.  A curtain covering a closed window seemed as if it was blowing in the wind.  Wrinkles on a sheet seemed to swirl around like snakes.

About a month later I was just in the mall to buy a pair of shoes and all of a sudden out of nowhere I started panicking and feeling as if I was on an acid trip.  My perception was enhanced, sounds became louder, I felt nervous, uncomfortable and very paranoid.  I dropped everything at the shoe store that I was going to buy and rushed out in a panic.  It was as if I was running away from something but I couldn't figure out what.", "I was too scared to share my feelings with anyone because I thought they would think I was crazy so I lived like this for about two years that I can remember all on my own.  Now my life and mindset are more at a relaxed state and I look at my traumatic experience as a lesson learned well.  I personally know for a fact that my 'LONG LASTING flashback' was definately due to my previous LSD use.  It was not worth the trouble that it caused me and my family.", "I don't remember ever feeling negative about anything before and since my LSD use (1 time) , it has destroyed a part of me that is greatly missed.

Curiously after this I would feel at complete peace -serene-as if my head had been 'flushed' of all problems. This stopped immediately after stopping acid.", "Associations/Rationalising - Perhaps the most serious side effect, lasting a number of years(3-5) after final use, was that I was my ability to rationalise in everyday life was seriously hampered. I was making wrong connections/associations - for example I believed my 'fate' was geared around the number '67' which related to (amongst other things) the number of letters in a poet's name whose poems 'spoke' to me, addresses of houses, names of girlfriends (the list goes on...)", "To conclude, what an experience! but I wouldn't take it more than a few times if I had my time again.", "I had taken the hit over 2 hrs ago.

Horrordancinginmemory.", "I will never forget the night I first tried lsd.  I was 15 years old and a freshman in highschool.  It was a cool summer evening and the sky was very clear.  Like many other teens I had already experimented with marijuana and was starting to become one of it's biggest fans.  It was one of those spur of the moment kind of things like many teenagers do.", "My best friend Jay and I went to another friend's house nicknamed ODB.  He was already big in to drugs, so over the past months he had been transforming his room in to a 'hippie's paradise'.  He had blacklights, posters, some he had bought and some he had made himself.  We walked in to ODB's room and he was already preparing for the 'big night'.  Making his bed and setting up a T.V. that we never ended up watching.  He was running around frantically cleaning his room and putting up a couple more posters. ", "I remember walking in to his closet and seeing blacklight posters and other things that may amuse us later.  Soon after ODB was finished, another one of my good friends, Beast came over.  He was the one with the stuff.  He eagerly handed out the mysterious drug.  Jay and I only took one hit because we were kind of sketchy about it.  But ODB and Beast being the 'pro's' took two apiece.", "The waiting was the only bad part of the night.  I had never done acid before so the anxiety was almost unbearable.  Jay and I had to go visit my girlfriend at another guy's house.  The walk over there was fun and seemed unusually short.  I had this great feeling inside me, like I was the happiest guy on the face of the planet.  It felt like there were a million things to do and I wanted to do them all but there wasn't enough time.  The simplest things seemed amusing and interesting to me.  I wanted to pet that dog, or go into that store.  I wanted swing on the swings and throw around rocks.  Just stupid little things like that.  I wasn't for sure if it had kicked in all the way at that point but I was pretty sure that something abnormal was going on.", "My girlfriend took us to a party where they were watching some older horror movies.  The waiting dragged on but it wasn't until the middle of Texas Chainsaw Massacre the fun truely began.  It was about 10 guys and girls crammed into a dark small living room.  Most of the kids were straight edge, which meant that they did nothing that would harm their body and never consumed foriegn substances that would impair them in any way.  There we were, Jay and I in the middle of the dark living room floor laughing hysterically at what was supposed to be the scariest part.  I felt like I could see in all directions without even turning my head.  Everything around me seemed to creep slowly toward me as if to tickle me.  This made me laugh even more.  I looked at Jay and he just didn't seem to look 100% right.  I then realized it was because he looked taller and stretched out like bubblegum.  I knew at that point the lsd had taken it's effect on me.  ", "I felt like was part of the room instead of just a guest sitting in it.  It was an undescribable feeling.  Jay and I were so excited that we had to meet back up with ODB and Beast.  The walk back to ODB's house was like nothing I've ever experienced before.  Cigarettes were like a gourmet meal and they went down like water.  I went through a half of a pack on the half mile walk.", "When we got back to ODB's house and met up with him and Beast, we shared a look as if to say to each other 'This stuff is the shit'.  We all knew how each other was feeling.  The scene that night was like one out of a hippie movie.  The 4 of us were crammed into ODB's small walk-in closet with his blacklights on and the song by Oasis 'champagne supernova' on repeat.  We just layed there and talked and laughed and joked around like most immature teenagers did.  At that point I felt the closest to my friends than I ever have before.  We sat their sharing memories and remeniscing about past summers of skateboarding and smoking pot.  Sometimes Beast, right out of nowhere would pick up his leg and say 'Hey guys I found this leg just sittin here.  What should I do with it?'  It was stupid but very amusing to us at the time.", "As it started to get later and later then earlier and earlier we could tell that the acid was starting to lose it's effects.  The 4 of us went outside to pass around a couple of joints Beast had on him.  What can I say?  The kid came prepared.  After the joints I felt like I was tripping again.  We went back in to ODB's house as quiet as 4 tripping kids could have.  We laid down a little more and declared ourselves drug buddies. Unfortunately the pot took it's effect too and over powered the faint traces left of the acid.  We all ended up falling asleep around 5:00 am.  Poor ODB had to go to hockey practice the next day but me Beast and Jay didn't care, at least we got to sleep in.", "Recently I had an experience with LSD that I will never be able to forget. It is the trip that all others will be compared to...the effects it has had on my view of reality are shattering, and I believe that, although it was a bit jarring at times, it was an invaluable learning experience..", "First, a few thoughts on psychedelic drugs in general - I believe that everyone needs to experience a reality that is otherwise completely alien to the individual. There is absolutely no way to imagine the effects psychedelic drugs have on the brain without living through it. If we can exist in a completely different dimension for a few hours, we can objectively view 'normal' reality for the first time. It is freedom from the mundane, and it is a world where money, government, oppression, and all the pervasive aspects of the world can dissolve into the background completely and honestly. ", "So now that I'm done preaching, I'll get into the experience.  Me and my friend were bored one night, and put 10 dollars down on a bottle of liquor before coming home, with the intention of getting pleasantly inebriated and laughing at the television.  Well, this changed when a certain friend showed up with a vial of LSD.  Interested in jumping down the psychedelic waterfall, we got our money back on the alcohol and bought a hit for each of us, which was dropped on our tongue.  We quickly drove home, wary of drug effects hitting us while I was driving, and started to buzz a little as we arrived at my house. The effects I had experienced many times before had hit my brain, and we spent the next 6 hours or so laughing like idiots, smoking cigarettes and generally having a good time just looking at the curtains and house plants gently swaying in wind that wasn't there.  About 7 hours into our trip, we figured the experience was pretty much over, and sat down to watch a movie.  We couldn't have been more mistaken.  At one instant, my friend was flashing the lights on and off, and I was laughing.  The next instant, all hell broke loose in my mind.  It was as if the switch that controls my perception of reality was yanked out of my brain.  It must have both hit us at the same time, because suddenly my friend wasn't smiling anymore...he had the look that an infant must have on his face the first time he experiences a thunderstorm -fear and wonder.  The conversation that took place at this moment will shed some light on our state of mind..", "Friend - I was turning the light on and now it looks different.", "This kind of quiet mumbling continued for another two or three minutes, until we both sat down on the floor and faced each other solemnly.  We were both so incredibly dumbstruck at the feelings that were pervading our minds that we could do nothing but stare at each other with a stupid kind of disbelief.  I stretched my arms out and stated that my mind felt as big as the room.  I had the very tangible and frightening feeling of melting into the floor and up the wall, and I when I licked my lips, it felt like I was licking someone else's.  All of a sudden I got up and started to walk around the house, which was a chore. The walls were groaning and breathing with life, and it was difficult to recognize my family members or even myself in the pictures hanging on the wall. We wandered around my home of 19 years as if it were an alien landscape.  I sat down in a chair and attempted to turn the computer monitor on, which I could not.  The button was jumping from side to side so quickly that my finger couldn't find it fast enough. I looked at my arm, and it looked extremely distorted.", "I could see red and blue and green lines pulsating up and down my arm in rhythm with everything else.  Eventually I did get the computer on and managed to play a song.  I laid on the floor and listened to the music, which seemed to be coming from all directions at once.  As I closed my eyes, I felt my body rise off of the floor, and patterns and colors assaulted me.  I ended up listening to an Eels song over and over again.. one of the lyrics was 'my skin is melting off, i'm mopping up the sweaty drops..' This drove me nuts, it was fascinating and real.. I felt like I was connected to the earth in a way that I've never been before, as if I was not an individual anymore, but as big as the universe itself, engulfing the room with my mind and body at the same time.  For a while I got frightened, I felt like a deer with a rifle pointed at it; helpless and alone in a different dimension. Time didn't exist, and it is difficult to let go of yourself in that way.", "I went and laid down on my mother's bed, thinking it would be comforting.  I curled into a fetal position in the middle of the bed under the sheets, which was incredible. I could imagine what a baby must feel like in the womb. Within moments though, I had the very strong feeling that there were other beings in the room with me, entities about 3 feet tall making strange noises and surrounding the bed.  This was frightening and I got up and went into the other room.  I spent the next hour staring at the close rack with some pants hanging on it.  The clothes were all swaying back and forth with such intensity. It was startling, I never thought one drop of acid could have such a powerful effect.  My friend had laid down in my brother's room and was meditating quietly, and I did the same thing.  I don't remember the hours after I laid down, but when I came to, the major effects were gone.", "The next day I could barely talk. I was simply shattered from the experience. As I slowly gained my strength over the course of the morning, I began to realize the blessing that I had experienced; I had a new respect for my life, just *being* had a new meaning for me. As of now, I am exhausted, but I feel good for getting this off of my chest. I haven't had any experiences with LSD after that night, I feel like I've been there and felt the true effects of the drug.  Future exploration is likely if I can find a good source, but where I live it is damn near impossible.", "I was born in 1971 and by 1985 I wanted to try LSD.  I hadnt even been drunk, high, or even nicotine-buzzed at that point.  I had read stories about my idols, 60's musicians like The Beatles and Jim Morrison, taking acid.  As a musician, artist, and general social outcast, it only seemed logical to take it.  By 1989, my senior year, I had become quite a drunk and and in love with Marijuana.  I finally one night took the acid and everyone doing it with me went home after we all peaked.  The experience wasn't as potent as I had hoped, with only mild visuals.  Through the next 9 years I continued to (mostly) trip alone as I had that first time.  I always felt safer alone, where no one could set me on a bad trip.  I only took 1 hit usually, and only once or twice a year.  Those years were spent in the Military Police, Art School, and a bad marriage.  I loved LSD but as I said, used it with extreme moderation.  I loved the long wakeful nights tripping and pondering my existence or watching movies.  I only hallucinated a few times, mostly I just felt so aware of the 'big picture'.", "Towards the end of the 90's I had a new, happy relationship and custody of my child from the previous marriage.  I got a temp position at a new steel mill in town where everyone was making HUGE money.  The year I worked there I was so intent on getting hired full-time, that I smoked hardly any weed at all for fear of urinalysis.  Instead I took acid.  In one two-month period I took over FORTY hits!  Now, for me acid is like vodka-you get more out of it as your experience and mental tolerance increases.  I was like a walking disciple of Christ himself, seeing only the 'big picture' and beautiful reality of this world.  I delved into books on everything from Astronomy to Religion.  Since that period I have understood so much more about what this world really is and it's value as a material.", "Why did I suddenly quit taking acid in Oct 98 to never touch it again?  Well this is where the reality of drugs and what they do comes into play.  I got so enamoured with the LSD experience that I was taking it on-stage. I was a George Harrison impersonator in a Beatles Tribute band, and it made it seem as though I was having an IN-body experience--as if I were air-guitaring to the Beatles, when it actually WAS me coming through the speakers!  I felt I had dropped into George's body!  This kind of stuff only fueled my love for the drug.  I started practically living on LSD, taking it every 4th or 5th day.  By the end of that year I was talking in jumbled hesitant words.  I am a good speaker and I couldnt even get a sentence out without stuttering.  My memory was out the door too, my night vision sucked (and I think weed causes that too), and I was getting very moody.  ", "The final trip in Oct 98 was not fun AT ALL.  Usually my custom was to consume enough liquor for 3 or 4 people (LITERALLY) whilst dosing.  That particular night I drank over a half of a 1/5th of good imported Tequila and got the spins right as the acid peaked.  The next 2 hours seemed like 2 WEEKS!  I was with my wife and a bunch of lesbians I used to jam with in a band.  I think the crowd made me even MORE nervous.  I felt like I was in the eye of a twister with no way to anchor myself to any thought or concept for more than a split second.  It was horrifying, and trying to explain my situation and keep cool about it was making it worse.  I felt rude and embarrassed for losing it and that made me flip out all the more.  I haven't taken it since.", "When I stop using for a month or two I can tell a noticable difference.  I feel more alert, but also depressed because after having seen the beauty of it, life seems dull.  This is why I never tried heroin-I KNEW I'd be an addict in a day.  It's been almost three years now and that feeling wont leave me.  Maybe it's what people call being jaded, I dont know.  I just know that nothing seems all that exciting to me anymore.  I havent worked in two years, I stay home with my newborn son.  My wife has an excellent job and we tell people that's why I stay home.  It IS the reason, but I must also admit that I dont want to be involved in the world anymore, and I am scared shitless about going back to work.  I still write and record music, but I dont care to ever accomplish anything again.  Aside from the closest friends and family, I see no one.  Sometimes I wish I had never been enlightened and still had all of my foolish desires that acid freed me from. When you experience levels of consciousness like that of drugs, especially the powerful ones like LSD, you really are never the same person again.  I feel that I am a better person now, but that doesn't mean life in the material world is better for me.  I just wish Christ (or whatever it is) would come rescue us all today, and I have frequent anxiety attacks concerning the possible (numerous) amount of years and lives that await me in this world of pain and suffering.  I wonder, have my enlightening experiences showed me truths I was not designed to handle, or are the square people right--am I just mind-bent now?", "Over a 2-3 year span I have ingested, among other things, a total of approximately 500 'hits' of LSD.  Most of this was in liquid form, some blotter, and a few geltabs.  Individual doses have varied from 1 'hit' to approximately 50.  There were stints where I would dose every 2-3 days, other times I would wait months between trips.  I have never had any reliable information on the number of micrograms of acid in these doses.  I have experimented with many other psychedelics but never done any regularly, except for MJ.  Here are some thoughts I have on these experiences, things I have learned and responses to other trip reports I have seen:", "When I first started with acid, I regarded my first few trips as pretty monumental and had specific memories of things I did and how I felt, etc.  As I dropped more and more the trips have sort of blurred.  Things aren't as 'special' to me when I'm on acid as I thought they once were, but I think that is a product of my head.", "In other words, I initially thought they were special because I was young and naive and self-centered, and the drug was new to me.  Later, when on acid, the moments were just as special as ever while they occurred but not significant in my memory after the trip.  In this sense, acid has helped me to be aware of when I am living in the present and when I am not.  I think many people are not aware that they are mentally working much more actively in the past or future than paying attention to what is occurring in the present.   I'm curious to see what would happen if I can stay away from acid for several years and come back to it, if the 'special' feeling would return.  Also, the first acid trips I had were mostly on higher quality LSD than later trips.", "Most of my trips were at home, some at raves, some at clubs, some at school, some just walking around.  Once comfortable with the drug, I was able to drive on it without much difficulty (not that I'd suggest trying it).  Movies used to be fun on it, but lost their appeal.  Music was always great, especially live.", "The effects I have come to associate with acid have varied widely from trip to trip.  You can see the FAQs on the effects, what I had was never any different.  Marijuana has a strong affect on the trip.  Generally I would either have no MJ while tripping or a lot of it.  Without, the trip would be less visual and more interactive, more like flying; with, it became more shaman-esque, I would feel more like I was sinking into the world and the hallucinations were more engulfing (more like an escape).  A lot of people seem to have trouble tripping without MJ, but I've come to appreciate doing it both ways -- just different.  Also, nitrous oxide was often a pleasant addition, though I would tend to use it compulsively when tripping.  I tried DXM once while on LSD, but I didn't find it very pleasant.  I don't like DXM much, though.", "I haven't had any trips that have been entirely 'bad'.  It is possible to get into a negative wavelength/downward spiral on the drug mentally, but I have never really lost myself in one (though I know plenty of people who have).  I was almost always in a good mindset before/during the trip and excited to have the drug/experience.  I haven't freaked out on acid (except the first time I did it, but that was just because I'd never done it), either.  I would have difficulty sleeping on the drug -- I wouldn't suggest one assume they would be able to.  Most of my unpleasant moments would come at these times.  Alcohol wouldn't really make this condition much better, I would simply be drunk while I was tripping.  I never had access to Thorazine.", "I became very used to the drug and to guiding myself through trips.  A lot of less experienced trippers aren't really able to do this and are probably more prone to having 'bad trips'.  As I learned to trip it became easier to get the types of hallucinations I liked and I became very comfortable with what the drug would do -- including negative effects.  I guess the 'shock' the acid had when I started to use it went away as I did more, but the effects remained.", "When I would do a lot of acid my sleep patterns would be disrupted -- but I've always had strange sleeping habits.  Most of the negative physical effects (like muscle tension) were, I think, more a result of being physically tired and mentally fatigued/strung out (occasionnally sensory overload).  I would often have really bad gas while tripping, but I consider this more a result of improper eating habits before/during the trip.  Since I was generally tripping so much, I didn't really set up my eating in a way to facilitate comfortable tripping.  I wouldn't suggest eating too much before/during the trip. ", "I'm no longer really sure what the acid has 'done' to me or what the lingering effects are.  I thought I knew/understood for awhile, but in the meantime my concept of who/what I am has been completely blown away.  I feel like I've become a completely different person over the course of my use (which I have stopped recently).  The things I believe in and care about have completely changed, but it is difficult to know if that would have happened without the drug, too.  It could have just been a part of my natural development.", "Sometimes my head feels hollow, but my cognitive functions don't seem at all impaired.  I can still do well in school, work, etc., though I do have a tough time 'putting on a happy face' and performing tasks that I think are bullshit or that I don't want to do (like preparing reports on items that are of no personal significance for work/school, especially when they are for people or purposes that I think are full of shit).  I feel a more intense need for self-expression, which becomes increasingly difficult to do with words.", "I have become more quiet, withdrawn -- acid has really made it clear to me the futility of words to accurately or completely describe anything, therefore I don't feel the need to try so hard to use them.  This makes it more difficult to relate to casual/professional acquaintances on a bullshit, everyday social level.  FYI, I used lots of marijuana and alcohol over this period, too, but not any hard drugs on a regular basis.  I think the alcohol use probably has fucked with my head, body, and personal life exponentially more than the acid.  MJ is MJ, see the Erowid FAQ.", "I have noticed a decline in my immune capabilities and general energy level, especially during periods of high use.  My sleeping patterns weren't consistent or healthy and I wasn't eating very well either.  Of course, these problems were facilitated by the other drugs, too, and my condition has improved (and I think it will continue to do so) since I stopped dropping.  Every so often I have some sort of minor hallucination, but never a full-scale 'flashback'.", "Those who are informed that something is wrong with them b/c of their acid use (or any drug use, for that matter) or that they have been permanently negatively affected by it would do well to understand that this is simply pressure being put on you by people who don't understand you and/or wish you were different.  There is a lot of anti-drug propaganda out there and it can be tough to push it out of your head -- it can be especially tough for people who have never tried drugs to get these messages out of their heads, too.", "The ruling class is only trying to deter you from using drugs, with drug tests, anti-drug laws, and anti-drug propaganda, etc., so that you can be more easily controlled and, more literally, used for their purposes.  Most people are afraid of the ruling class and feel pressured to spread their messages (the major media organizations do this, for example) and conform to their preferred morals/ideals.  It is easier for those in power to control you if you are just like everyone else who cooperates with their systems and rules -- systems and rules which are set up and administered to benefit THEM, not you or your mental health.   ", "These things certainly don't make drug use 'wrong'.  This does not make using them inherently unhealthy.  It is possible to use drugs responsibly.  You are not committing a sin every time you drop a tab, light a joint, or snort a line.  The problem here is that a lot of people believe a lot of bullshit and are given incentives to force their (often misled) moral constraints on others.", "Remember, there is no 'normal' and everyone here is free to be/do whatever they want.  Acid can seem to distance you from the perceptions of the rest of the world population, but when the world is as constantly full of shit as this one, I don't think there is harm in that.  Acid can make you aware of the shit, which is why I think so many people tend to 'rebel' who do acid.  When people tell you something is wrong with you because of drug use, they are essentially full of shit.", "Personally, I think acid can really open your mind.  I had a really closed mind before my experiences and I didn't even know it.  During those times, I hurt a lot of people and I believed that I had some sort of moral obligation to act in a certain way and live by certain standards.  Now, I no longer think of myself in this way or limit myself to these artifical constraints.  In short, I think it has been an excellent thing for my maturation.", "I have gone through periods where I have worried about permanent damage and/or changes that have happened b/c of the acid.  My advice to those in this situation would be to relax: everything in life changes you somehow, and once it has happened there is no going back.  I definitely don't feel any 'dumber' and I don't feel like 'damaged goods'.  If anything, I feel like the acid has made me much more aware of who I am and where I am, and more able to appreciate the things about life I enjoy.  I was battling moderate/severe depression throughout this period.  I wouldn't say the acid made that go away, but it did show me how life can be perceived and how beautiful it is to be alive (this was helpful while I was depressed, the acid can grant a repreive from the shit).", "I felt more schizophrenic BEFORE my acid use than AFTER.  I have never received counseling for my depression/drug habits and have not been diagnosed with any mental disorder.  I don't know what it would feel like to be schizophrenic, and any notion I had of being 'normal' has been gone for a long time.  When people think you have a mental condition that needs 'treatment' they are merely trying to make you think what they think you ought to be thinking and act how they think you ought to be acting -- it is no instrinsically better or worse than how you actually are or feel you should be yourself. ", "The geltabs I've done have always been the best quality, both in terms of direct effects and spititual heightening.  Papers are never really reliable (I've gotten bunked a few times) and most of the liquid I've had has been okay, but not great.  If you have had bad/hollow experiences with liquid or papers, I'd suggest trying geltabs (if you can get any) before rejecting the drug completely.  Dealers have a tendency to rip people off sometimes, but the integrity of the drug is not compromised by this fact.", "Apart from the occasional caffeine (which has little effect on me) and a few half-glasses of champagne at various special events, and some demerol in hospitals on two occasions, I had no experience with psychoactives prior to trying LSD.  Stimulants and depressants are simply not appealing to me and opiates are far too risky.  As long as I have known about them (probably since one of those 'Just Say No' lectures that public schools were constantly having in the 80s) LSD (and by extension all psychedelics) have been intriguing to me.  I vaguely remember at some point in 8th or 9th grade thinking 'if only LSD did not cause brain damage it would be the perfect drug, and even I would try it'.  ", "Roll the clock forward about 10 years.  I have recently started reading Hunter Thompson and listening to an increasing amount of psychedelic music (both 1st generation stuff and newer things like the Butthole Surfers and the Cramps).  Naturally, I sought out information on these fascinating substances which had inspired so much great music and literature.  Before long, I had learned that, while certainly not 'safe' (what is?), the risks of LSD were almost entirely of the psychological nature.  The point is, between the time at which I decided I was going to try LSD and the time I actually tried it I spent about 7 months researching and generally preparing myself mentally for it.  This definitely payed off... when I later described some of the most impressive moments of the trip to my friend who acted as guide (and who has had a lot of experience, having taken acid a few hundred times), she was suprised that I had enjoyed it at all.  I loved it, paranoia, loss of self, loss of linear time and all.  I was not anxious to try it again immediately, but I will almost certainly use it again in the future; I could easily see myself using it once or twice a year indefinitely.", "I arrived the day before and slept on the couch.  the next morning I awoke around 10 and took a long shower, followed by a light breakfast (I cannot remember precisely what).  We sat and talked for a little while with her boyfriend, then got the acid from te refrigerator and divided it up.  It was difficult to tell how much I took because we only had leftover edges from a sheet, but in retrospect it is clear that she had a prett good idea of how much was actually there.  At any rate, I had about four pieces; she had two.  After eating it (I swallowed the paper after a minute or so, which her boyriend then warned me not to do - it made his stomach upset...) her boyfriend left for work and we sat and talked aout nothing in particular, looked at some Maurice Sendak books, and waited.  And waited.  After about 20 minutes I was just beginning to feel it.  Nothing was actually different, but there was an increasing sense of anticipation: SOMETHING was about to happen.  We moved to the living room and put on some music. Some buddhist chants she had downloaded a few weeks before... nice background music, though somewhat humorous on a meta level: here we are, full of acid listening to buddhist chants in her living room.  I found the idea of that strangely amusing.  Something was happening, all right.  ", "I guess it took about an hour before it really kicked in, but I can't be sure.  I tend to be kind of analytical, so she had hidden all of the clocks in the house beforehand and I had placed my watch safely out of reach.  The wait was definitely on the long side, though.  Then, without much warning, I could feel it starting to pick up: sort of waves of electricity traveling up my body.  She was obviously farther along than I, and asked if I wanted more or not (we had previously discussed whether to go for a lot right off or do a bit at a time so I didn't get more than I felt comfortable with; it ended up being somewhere in between, as my initial dose was probably about the same as an average tab).  I said 'sure' and she went to the kitchen to get it.  I stood up and took a few steps toward the wall.  All of a sudden, everything started to twist into a sort of counterclockwise nautilus spiral, which was centered somewhere above and to the left of my head.  This was not visual (though there was initially a slight, brief distortion); it was only a nearly overpowering feeling.  I looked at the prints and drawings that were hanging on the wall and thought something along the lines of 'I am HERE.  This is it.'  About this time, she returned with three more pieces which I put in my mouth and sucked on for maybe five minutes.  I had not tasted anything from the first dose I took (which I attribute to the fact that I held it for about five minutes before taking it and my palms were slightly sweaty), but this one had a definite flavor.  Despite her boyfriend's assertion that it tasted unpleasant, I enjoyed it.  Interestingly enough, it tasted a bit like the acid (of a very different type) that dentists use to soften a tooth before filling it - a taste most people probably dislike.", "Now that we were fully taking off, I soon remembered that we had planned on drawing.  We got out crayons and paper and made a 'book', which took somewhere between 15 minutes and an hour.  When we were tired of drawing, we sat for a few minutes on the floor and did not do much of anything.  Neither of us were having any significant visuals.  Light seemed a little brighter and more 'pure' and sometimes moved on its own.  Distances were distorted.  There were no heavy colors or patterns, however, and nothing was significantly distorted.  That is not to say that the trip was at all mild up to this point, however.  It was simply not going on in the visual domain.  Most of the changes were in perception, thought processes, and so forth.  Very subjective, very hard to put into words.  And, while I did not SEE any distortions or trails or the like, I certainly FELT them.", "We were still sitting on the floor comparing notes when suddenly I snapped back to normalcy.  It was almost instant and almost complete.  Here I was sitting on the floor, perfectly sober.  And there was the couch over there, a few feet away.  I suddenly know that I had to get over there quickly while I still had the chance.  I muttered something to that effect and stood up, stepped across the floor (only one step... but what a step it was) and dropped onto the couch.  ", "...ceiling, acoustic tiling.  Tunneling upward.... the second dose must be kicking in... ", "'I... I think I might be a while... if you... want to read a book or something...'", "... picture on the wall is... alive... shapes crawling into themselves...", "I am siting on the couch.  It is a bit darker outside than it was last time I noticed.  Everything around me is still more or less solid, but it seems very distant.  The computer is on, and some of the colors are leaking off of the screen onto the side of the monitor, but the picture itself is the only thing in the room that seems to be completely noral.  Strange.", "I am looking across the room.  I do not know how long I have been here.  I can feel my body and the couch flowing into each other, a strangely comforting sensation.  I am alone in the room, but I know that someone is in the other room, and will be back soon.  Or is that me?  Am I really just a reflection of what I am looking at?  I can feel my presence start to leak out into the couch, like water from a plastic bottle with a leak in the bottom.  The level of my existance is falling down my body; only my eyes and teeth are left.  Just before everything else disappears completely into the couch, I remember reading 'The Psychedelic Experience' earlier that week, and recognize that this is, in its eccentric way, the 'pure whit elight' that Leary was talking about.  Thinking this makes me quickly flow back up out of the couch into myself, much to my chagrin.  I suppose that the act of thinking reminded me that I exist.  I begin to flow out again, but it does not go much lower than my chest, and I end up laying back on the couch and just enjoying being around.", "How long has it been since then?  Minutes?  Hours?  Someone says something to me and a large stuffed bee attached to a keychain lands on my chest and looks at me.  I look back.  It is a friendly bee.  I like it.", "It is definitely nighttime now; the windows are dark.  We have been playing Atari 2600 games on the computer for some time now.  Or rather, I have been watching her play.  I occasionally try to control the action a bit, but mostly I am content to watch.  There is a game called 'Bobby is going home'.  Bobby is jumping across puts and dodging viscious greek letters(!).  The sky is purple, and the sun is flying around the sky in a figure 8 pattern.  Bobby reaches the edge of the screen and moves to the next: the sun becomes a giant bird!  I am now convinced that the atari 2600 was designed by and for acid users.", "I am walking to the kitchen to get a drink of water.  The observing part of my brain realizes how absurd te entire situation is.  It thinks of Peter Fonda: the perfect icon of the ridiculousness of LSD.  For a brief moment I am standing behind myself watching: I AM Peter Fonda.  I get my water, set it on a shelf, forget where it is, return, find it, drink it.  We go to the bedroom to look at the ceiling, which is a sort of lumpy stucco.  On the way, we notice a poster which depicts farm animals picketing.  All of them are carrying signs except for the duck, who has a small red banner.  We are sure that this is very important, but cannot decide why.  I look at myself in the mirror and... there I am!  And I can even move my mouth and eyes!  I am happy to see this.  ", "We have watched the ceiling for a while but we are both feeling restless.  It has been quite a few hours now, and she is clearly overmost of it.  I am still feeling strange, but I am definitely over the peak.  We decide that, despite the cold and the icy streets, we are going to walk round outside a little bit.", "Out in the hallway.  Bare white walls.  No furniture except for a salvaged church pew with a life-sized cast of a tombstone sitting on it.  We reach the front door and she tries to open it.  Nothing.  It is frozen.  My mind races: the night before her boyfriend was late getting home from work and we had locked the keys in the apartment.  We were stuck out in the rain for two hours.  Now we want to get back out and we are locked IN!  The perfect symmetry!  I am overcome by the humor of the situation.  am I laughing?  I feel as though I am splitting apart from the waist up, becoming multiple images, like a photograph taken under strobe lights.  But none of the motion is actually happening, is it?  Is it?", "The door finally opens - it was frozen shut - and we leave the house.  I loo0k at the snow underneath the drainspout and admite the pefect fractal curve of crystals that are formed where water dripped onto it and froze.  We walk down the street.  The cold is severe, and I am starting to lose track of my body.  Am I here?  We walk down another street, but time is beginning to come apart.  I am no longer experiencing my existance as a steady stream.  It is a series of three basic images: looking forward, looking sideways, looking down at my feet.  Each step I take the image changes in a cycle.  This goes on forever, quite literally.", "We are at a bus stop.  A bus pulls up and the images speed up.  I slide back into normal time and we decide not to get on the bus.  I slide back to the ccling images, but there are more of them, closer together.  We are in a richer neighborhood now.  It is very dark, and all of the houses seem abandoned.  We do not stay long.  We are back on the main street, heading to the apartment.  We pass a gas station.  There is a large van filled with police.  I feel unmoved: this is just the part where I act normal.  We walk past and nobody pays the slightest bit of attention.  I feel as if I am not actually connected to my body, but am in fact floating inside of it and trying to steer it around.  She mentions something she read about that very sensation, though I had not mentioned it to her.  'I know exactly what you mean' I say loudly.  The man walking his dog past us looks at me disapprovingly.  'But he doesn't,' I say, trying hard not to burst out laughing.", "We are at an intersection.  I cannot tell when and where the traffic is, but she is nearly back to normal and has no trouble negotiating the street crossing.  As I step out into the road, however, I realize that I am no longer connected to my body at all:  it is walking off across the road without me.  Horror: what if I cannot catch up with it?  The cars are coming!  My body is almost across the street, but my consciousness is still standing right in the middle of it.  I dash to the curb and, more or less, back into my body.  I am not connected to it yet, but I have caught it and I fo not think it is going anywhere again.  Sure enough, net time we cross a street, I only lag behind it slightly the first step or two.  I am getting the hang of driving it around again.", "Back in the apartment.  We are both getting tired, but there is no chance of sleeping yet.  It is probably only 8 or 9 pm, anyway.  We wander about, trying to decide what to do.  It is cold.  I am still shaken from beign outside.  We want to watch a movie, but can't decide what.  Finally we choose 'Heavenly Creatures', a personal favorite of each of us.  Her copy is a pre-releasse bootleg in an unmarked tape.  We heat up some vegan pizza-pocket type things (she is vegan; I hardly eat much meat, but thrive on cheese and find most vegan food of this kind a bit bland, so I am not overly aggressive about eating it) and start the tape.  Soon we are both deeply absorbed in the movie.  However, the way she relates to it is, naturally, quite different from the way I relate to it.  Slowly but surely I begin to feel isolated.  I begin to notice that whenever any of the characters on the screen are hostile, the picture becomes grainy and their faces begin to deform.  Soon, not only are there distortions whenever characters are hostile or angry, but hissing sounds as well.  And the angrier they get, the worse my food tastes.   When they are happy, the food tastes better, the picture is clear, and there is no distortion or hissing.  I begin to notice that the characters who are most grusomely deformed are men.  And then it dawns on me: the distortions are not because of the LSD!  No, what is really happening is that the tape was specially prepared in order to imprint me with some kind of anti-male, anti-heterosexual personality!  That is why it the tape was not labeled.  I begin to feel very uncomfortable.  On the screen, people begin to grow horns and their faces twist into hideous grimaces.  About halfway into the movie, there is a scene in which the main character loses her virginity to a particularly unpleasant, rattish man.  As he is about to reach orgasm... the tape breaks!  We stop the vcr and rewind it a bit to see if that will help, but there is no picture when we play.  We rewind some more: still no picture.  The tape is blank.", "We have not gotten the tape to work, despite 15 minutes or so of sitting and looking at the VCR.  I get up to go to the bathroom.  Once in the bathroom, I look into the mirror.  Throughout the trip, I have had menthol lip balm on, and it has made me unable to feel (and therefore, unable to remember the existance of ) the lower half of my face.  Off an on, I have felt that my facial expressions are actually the facial expressions of people I am looking at, but happening on my face.  This is an opportunity to test that.  I look in the mirror.  There I am, just like last time.  I think to myself 'I am not sure exactly who I am, but I am sure that whoever I am I like it a lot.'", "A few hours have gone by.  I am much closer to baseline now.  Just tired, and my thought patterns are strange.  Her boyfriend comes home and we sit and talk for a while.  He reads our book.  We keep him awake until about 2am, at which point we are all exhausted.  They go to bed, and I turn off the lights and lie down on the couch.  As I am about to close my eyes, I notice that the pattern on the couch is not just a pattern: it is a flaming, one eyed bird, and it is swooping down at me out of the cushion.  I look at it for a moment, trying to decide whether or not we will be friends.  I finally determine that we will get along, and close my eyes.", "Mild closed-eye visuals as I fall asleep: moire patterns, kalidescope patterns, flying down chrome tunnels.  At one point I am standing inside a strange house, looking out the window on the front door.  Outside the window, there is a porch with a chair on it.  On the chair sits a decaying corpse wearing a moth-eaten suit.  I soon decide that I do not ilike this and go back to the tunnels and patterns.", "About an hour later, I wake up.  There is a scratching sound: mice in the walls!  And... my mostly uneaten vegan pizza is still sitting on a plate by the couch.  If the mice decide the y want to eat it, they might crawl over me to get to it!  I must move it away!", "That is a basic account of what I can remember off the top of my head.  It has been nearly three months, and I have been consistently much happier, much more able to focus, much more aware of the world around me, much more sure of who I am.  I have always been pretty strong in all of these respects (though I am occasionally depressed for a week or two, as are most people I know), but since taking acid I feel as though they have all solidified.  I know exactly who I am and where I am.  While I might not be satisfied with everyhting in my life or th world, I am happy to be in it, as trite as that sounds.  I waited until I was in an especially good state mentally before taking the acid, and I believe that it did a lot help imprint tthat state of mind into my personality much more deeply than it already was.  For all the talk about LSD changing people's lives and personalities, I found that - much like hypnosis - it only created potential; the actual change was mad eby my own psyche.  To draw upon the overused but very effective Huxley metaphor, LSD opens a door in your mind.  But it does not make you walk through that door; that is up to you.", "Would I do LSD again? most definitely, if the opportunity to do it in a comfortable, safe manner presented itself.  I would also be curious to try performing routine activities (shopping for food; visiting a busy mall; going to a movie) under low doses once or twice.  At some point I am interested in trying DMT (which was the drug that I first began researching before deciding on LSD).  Despite the fact that some of the later parts of that first trip were not what most people would consider pleasant, and were certainly not fun, I did not consider them 'negative' experiences at the time nor do I now.  The only thing that I would really be unhappy about repeating would be crossing the street the first time.", "I would not outright recommend LSD to anyone.  Moreso than most drugs, it is a very complex descision.  I HAVE recommended that a couple of my friends who have not yet tried it but have some interest should spend some time reading about it and working at becoming comfortable with themselves before they even consider taking it.  Sure, it is possible to just go out and do it without any trouble, but I cannot imagine that it would be nearly as satisfying, at east the first time.  I think that it is incredibly important to have someone who you trust to guide you on your first trip.  This has been said many times, but once more couldn't hurt.  ", "One of the things that really helped me deal with some of the more uncomfortable moments was my firm belief that therre is no such thing as a 'bad' trip.  A trip can be uncomfortable or downright frightening, but that is only 'bad' if the tripper interprets it that way.  Some of the 'worst' experiences I've heard about from friends sound like some of the 'best' experiences I had (melting into the couch, for example - many other inexperienced people I have talked to were not at all comfortable when similar things happened to them).  At least for me, remembering that 'good' and 'bad' are just human inventions that have no real bearing on the experience kept me from struggling against the uncomfortable moments, which is important.", "If you go into it with the right mindset, I think acid can be one of the most positive and profound experiences a person can have, whether it is a 'good' trip or not.", "It was a late summer afternoon when it was decided. My bestfriend Roxanne & I were going to trip again. Going into this I feared nothing. I had tripped twice before only feeling hyper & extremely talkative. However, Roxanne had tripped three other times without me & swore of visuals & a mind blowing night of laughter that I just HAD to experience with her. ", "We picked it up at 6:00 in the evening. A guy we both knew said he could hook us up with some kick ass acid & set it up with another guy who was selling it. He gave us directions to his house & we drove on over to get it. As soon as we got it out to the car, we dropped it under our tounges immediately in his driveway before taking off. As we drove away, I felt unusually calm & unaware of the reality that I was all too soon going to find out.", "From there, we mosied on over to a nearby store to pick up some pictures that my friend had developed. Roxanne called her boyfriend Matt from a payphone there, who begged her not to trip...only it was too late. She informed him that the deed had already been done & after a gas & cigarette pit stop we would swing over to his house.", "Pulling into the BP: Approximately 7:00 p.m. - She pumped & I went to pay & get cig's & 2 quarts of OJ. I walked in feeling anxious & unusually hot, but still aware. 'It must be kicking in.' I thought to myself. Walking around the store I felt as if I were in fast foward mode. My feet seemed to carry me with a mind of their own & the other customers came & went simutaneously in a speedy sequence. I came outside to Rox who was frantically washing her windshield w/ a squeegie. When asked what she was doing, she laughed - 'Just this one last spot..' From that point on, time was lost. I remember drinking the entire qt. of OJ as she continued washing. We must have been out there for awhile because the cashier came outside to see if we were ok. ", "Matt's Apt: sometime around 7:30?? - I stepped out of the car smoking, happy & giggly. As I walked towards his front door I felt my feet sinking into the pavement like quicksand. I looked back at the row of cars parked behind us & spotted a 98' graduation tassle hanging from a rearview like it was in front of my face. Right then, I realized this wasn't going to be like the other trips. This was crazy. ", "Matt went to bed & upstairs in the bedroom sat only me & Roxanne. She stared at a red light blinking from the caller ID. I flipped through the newly developed pics & came across one of a waterfall. Looking at it, I realized it wasn't a waterfall at all. The water spray became a collage of spirits & ghosts with distorted faces rising upward. Marveled, I showed Rox & that's when things got bad. Before I knew it, standing beside me was a shadow of a man who stared at me. I was completely freaked & my trip had then became a domino effect. I saw a massive spider web that covered the ceiling. Pyramids w/ eyeballs protruded at me from around the room. Now, I'm scared. Somehow, the lights ended up turned off & the black lights on. We sat together staring at each other terrified, yet w/ a steady smile on our faces. - 'It's just a drug, you're ok.' we told each other. 'You're just tripping, this is why we took it.' as if comforting the other made ourselves feel better. This seemed to go on for long grueling hours. As she spoke, Roxanne morphed into an evil clown. She grew fangs & the corners of her mouth extended to her ears. Her eyes were huge and looked like they were under a magnifying glass. I was flipping the fuck out & memories of people talking of bad trips that lead to ER visits crept into my mind & I quickly swept them away. I WAS GOING TO BE OK. A piece of my memory recalls me looking into a mirror in a bathroom & the blue of my eye became a wave of ocean sloshing around. Roxanne's skin became wrinkled and she looked like a witch.", "'We gotta get outta here' we agreed. Rox told me we had to find a lake & sit by the water. When 1 of her trips turned ugly she sat in water & watched trees sway & gold fish splash on her feet. Things would be ok, she said. We went downstairs & when Matt's roomate's girlfriend found out we were leaving she asked us to stop at Taco Bell for some grub. We warned her we were trippin & she didn't seem to care as she sat down & made out an order on paper. During this time, I watched her writing & talking. I could see her lips moving but her voice had been tuned out. Her hair curled up into tight spirals & then unraveled back into straight locks continuously until the most horrifying blast of noise came crashing into my head. At first, I thought it was an airplane landing on top of the apartment. Then the noise became distorted and it's pitch stretched into a wave of a slow & blurred moan that can only be described as what possessed demon's voices sound like in horror movies. 'Do you hear that?' 'Do you guys FUCKIN HEAR THAT?' I interupted. The girl looked up & said - 'Uh...yeah, someone flushed the toilet upstairs.' ", "The dumb ass girl let us leave & two heavily drug induced girls with no sense of reality were unleashed into the world; trippin balls. Of course we never made it to Taco Bell. We were now locked into another dimension that no one else knew of besides us. And when faced with other people, they were imposters staring at us, INTO us, & we snubbed at them with disgust. Everything we did had become a 'mission.' At one point one of our missions was to buy some more cig's. I walked in the store & it all seemed to be enclosing on me. Tension was fierce & anxiety ran through me, pumping my blood faster. Waiting for the guy to ring me up, I looked around me repeatedly in a paranoid state. It seemed to take an eternity to get my change & I was enraged that this guy had the nerve to prolong the mission. I dont remember the exact words that came out of my mouth besides a slur of cuss words scattered around 'hurry up' & then - 'C'mon Roxanne let's get the fuck out of here.' ", "We never made it to the lake even though we stopped at Rox's house to get boxers & t shirts for our late night swim. My only memory of that was sitting on the toilet to watch the flowers spin & twirl on the shower curtain & her cat stopping in it's tracks, hissing - paralyzed with fear as if it sensed our crazed mind frame. ", "Driving in the middle of town: time unknown - the town was dead, it must have been quite late. Fog plagued outside surroundings & the street lights lit up in it's midst like bursting stars. The music was cranked, the sunroof was down & we floated from one side of the road to another with the flow of music, following it's beats. Happiness tugged at my nerves & I was finally starting to enjoy. I laughed uncontrollably. We ran into a guy Roxy knew in a parking lot when we stopped for cigarettes again. We followed him to his house & before I walked in I threw up orange juice into his bushes but didn't miss a step, not even stopping my stride. We smoked a blunt w/ him & left. I don't remember anything else until daylight broke. We ventured to a neighboring town trying to find the hill that overlooked the city. When we got to the top, we took off our clothes & slipped into the swimming motiff. Enter another block of lost memory & fast forward back into our town. We were driving when we spotted a girl we didn't like in front of us. Disgusted, we vowed we weren't going to follow her & took a detour - to where, I don't know. I just remember driving in a neighborhood and suddenly Roxanne leaned her head out the window to spit. I've never seen this girl spit before in my life & why she did at this particular moment I don't know. But it caused the car to land in a ditch on the right side of the road & then bounce to the ditch on the left and end in the middle of the road backwards. A woman tending her garden in the yard beside us never even looked up. Oil spilled a stream on the road & we decided that the oil pan was busted. We drove to the nearest gas station to call Matt to pick us up. It just so happened that it  was also beside our former high school as of the year before & it must have been time for school. Buses and people we knew were driving to school & loomed before us as we sat beside a payphone in our boxers, dirty & still smoking.", "When we got back to Matt's I laid down. I was exhausted & desperately craved for sleep & an end to this drawn out nightmare. But even when closing my eyes I saw ladybugs crawling on the inside of my eyelids. I don't remember when I finally passed out. It was well into the afternoon & acid had mixed with delirium & I recall thinking that the I had to get away from all of the 'normal people' that invaded the road as I drove home.", "That was the worst and last trip I've ever had. Messing with the chemicals in your brain isn't exactly wise. For months afterward I saw tracers & lines in walls or specks on ceilings squiggled around & swayed.You never know how you're mind is going to react to it & it can be frightening. At least in my experience anyway.", "A few weeks ago after a local concert a friend of mine named Chris and I had nothing to do, and it was about 1:30am. I offered him to trip with me and we both dropped a ten strip of pink elephant blotter. We are both experienced acid heads who've done that much before, so we weren't expecting anything out of the ordinary which is why we didn't get a sitter.", "At about 2 while I was buying Chris some cigaretts the acid began to work. As I walked into the CVS, the shop lifting detectors started to go off. This got me really paranoid and I thought that someone was going to arrest me so I ran out of the store and threw anything in my pockets that would've set off the alarm, and went back in. This time it was ok and nothing was beeping so I bought the cigarettes, and when I gave her the money her face became colored with what reminded me of indian war paint. I got to thinking that, I was in store for a really intense trip, that I wasn't prepared for.", "We got to Chris's house and sat in my friend Shaun's van, I asked Chris how he was doing and he said he wasn't doing that well and he thought it was a little too intense too. After talking to Chris for awhile I looked out the window of the van, and saw a pit of alligators and other lizards where grass normally is. I thought this was amazing and couldn't believe how real they looked, and all of a sudden a man riding a horse was charging down the street. Holy shit I thought, he's coming for me. Then he was gone I look all around and the alligators are still there. This isn't good my visuals usually go away after blinking or looking at something else, but this was different they wouldn't leave, are they real or fake I couldn't decided. My mind would not tell me. ", "I tell Chris whats going on he isn't doing well either but by far better than I'm doing. He tells me to go with him to see Shaun. I don't want to leave the gators were still there, he convinces me to go with him somehow. Inside Shaun's house the concrete floor is nothing but crocodile heads, and then blue and orange snakes apear and I can feel them crawling beneath my feet. Finally, Shaun shows up my whole body is shaking and I've chewed a straw into almost nothing. Shaun trys to calm me down but he can't help. So we leave.", "Next thing I can remember we're in a soccer field sitting on some bleachers the aligators are still there, but I've found out they don't want me, right now all of the alligators are fighting and fucking each other and are ignoring me for now. As we walk into the field there is a force field constructed by diamond shapes and as I walk through I can feel it. The stars in the sky have turned red and are shooting out white light. I look across the street and see dinosaurs, I ignore them. Holy shit there are 2 cars pulling into the field, are they cops? My friend assures me they are not and I hear a robotic voice yell 'get over here' Chris tells me he didn't hear anything. I begin to power walk back to Shaun's. ", "That is all I can remember from that night, but I know I spent a lot more time shaking and being frightened. I think I had such a bad trip because of two things, one no sitter, and two I couldn't decifer what was real or fake. The whole next day I didn't sleep at all and spent most of the day silent.", "Do you feel that the bad trip and the flashback were connected?", "I have taken LSD, maybe 30 to 40 times, in a 2 year period.  This was about 5 years ago.", "The last time I took LSD, I saw my friend take a running leap off a 3rd story balcony.  Needless to say, this quickly turned into a bad trip.  Even hours after the ambulance took him away, I could hear his voice calling my name and asking me to help him.  This went on until I started to come down.  I've also had other, more mild, bad trips.  Most were intense feelings of paranoia and fear.  I could usually bring myself down from these.  ", "A few days ago I had the 3rd of 3 experiences that I believe were flashbacks.  I was coming out of a rest stop restroom and suddenly started to feel dizzy. Everything around me started to look like a photo negative.  This was a common hallucination I had when I took LSD.  It was coming in and out everytime I blinked.  Then, I would lose my vision completely for a few seconds.  The whole time I was feeling dizzy and could barely walk.  Then, I started to have tunnel vision along with the negative images and the darkness.  I found myself crawling towards the front doors hoping my friend that was waiting outside would see me.  Thankfully, it was late at night and no one was there to see this.", "After laying down on the concrete for a few minutes it went away.  Another experience was similar to this.  The other was a tile floor that kept changing its pattern, but that only lasted a few seconds. To me the feeling is way more intense than an acid trip.  Maybe it's just because it took me by suprise. ", "I don't really feel that these flashbacks were direct results from bad trips.  But, 2 of them felt like bad trips.  They were very confusing and exhausting.", "The day started off as any normal day.  I got up and knew before hand that I would drop acid this day.  I had recently made a decision to stop smoking weed, and I thought a little LSD would give the introspection I needed to understand why I had to stop smoking.  ", "12:30: After calling the supplier met up with him in town.  The supplier was with a friend and she showed me what they had.  She was cutiing the pieces with some scissors.  She handed me two little pieces that were about the size of 2/3 of a normal tab.  I asked her if she was serious and she then told me that they had intended to buy a vial, but instead the guy soaked up all the acid from inside where it was made onto three pieces of paper.  Having known her a while, I believed her and went home.", "1:00: I decide to go on a hike up a creek by my house.  It would take  me to the top of a hill which I thought would be fun to look at. I dropped both hits and started walking.  I had a video camera, two Red Bulls, and a mind starting to expand.", "1:45: Drink one Red Bull,resume hiking.  I'm getting the pre-trip feeling.  Hope Red Bull will help me out.  ", "2:30: Acid had taken over.  I am on an outlook on top of the hill.  I watch the town below undulate and contort.  The distant clouds look like I could touch them if I wanted. Pulled out video camera and started to film.  ", "3:15: I'm at top of hill.  If I dont concentraight on my thoughts they will wander off on tangents.  I start to get paranoid that I was in Mountain Lion teritory and if one was to get me, no one would know.  I start back home.", "3:45: Before going home I sit on a rock and meditate on things, in general.  Then I go home.  No one is there so I'm cool.  I watch Dark City and it blows my mind.  I relate it to everyday life.  I get lost in it and when it is over I feel sad.  Now the hallucinations are everywhere and I feel like I'm in a kaleidescope.  I turn on VH1 and watch the 100 greatest Rock and Roll Artists.  I have a paranoid thought that maybe all old 70's bands did acid and got to the same level of tripping as I am in right now.  I start to appreciate all the artists I see and other things about them.", "4:45: Totally lost now, this stuff took me over.  Every thought I have turns into a vison. I ponder running to the beach, which is foutyr miles away.  Seriouslly.  Sanity comes back and I meelow out.  Start having real visions.  Like being in a dream while awake.  ", "6:45: Mellow now.  Hallucinations have stopped.  Stll freaked out about the visions.  Am in awe the rest of the day.", "The moral of this story is NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF LSD.  Once you do your fucked.  If i had been in public, I would have been arrested.  I totally lost contact with reality for about an hour.  Now, I am going to stay away from LSD.  To all you new, eager acid heads out there, beware.  What I thought was a joke of a dose turned into the most powerfull trip of my life.", "  First before i go to the expierience at hand i should give you some background of my use of LSD at that time. I took LSD practically every day at school for about 100 days straight. i would not be suprised if the following trip's frightful nature had something to do with this. I had also never had any visuals outside of small outlines on objects and minor trails. I had taken 10 hits of acid before but obvously it very weak in comparison to this stuff", "The worst trip ever (the best thing that has ever happened to me)", "  I was in the best mood of my life on this day. I had never been to a huge festival like Ozzfest. I was in the mindset that i would be going down in history like the people at Woodstock. I went down in history all right, but it was in my own book with a horrific chapter. As soon as my friend and I (we will call him C ) arrived on the lawn at Ozzfest we found our group of friends and started to search for our friend M, who was supposed to be bringing enough trip for the whole bunch. We found him but he could not obtain any before the show. We all (9 or 10 of us) were bitching about it when suddenly out of nowhere this hippie that looked like jesus with a gap between his teeth jumped down in front of us and said in a very Chong-like manner 'You guys wanna buy some L-S-D? Of course we were all like 'sure'! Each of my friends except for C bought 2 hits. But me and C each bought what appeared to be about a 12 strip. While Jesus was showing everybody his silvery nugs, C and I dropped the entire strip.", "  At that moment Jesus turned around and said 'Hey can you sell this guy ( my friend J)a couple of hits, i wanna hold on to this half sheet for that bunch over there' I told him i couldn't and he asked why.", "'You ate that whole strip?' (the whole group looked at me like i was crazy.", "And with that Jesus was out of there like a lightening bolt. Within about 5-10 minutes i heard everyone else exclaiming about how they had never had acid come on so quickly and how beautiful everything looked. That's the last coherent thought I had that day. ", "Incubus had just come onto the stage and they started in on some odd brazilian-type bongo epic. I looked around me and noticed every blade of grass was individually colored. I felt a wave of anxiety come over me like i had never expirienced. I quickly lit up a cigarette to calm myself but it only made things worse. Every motion i made with my hands just created a wall of trails behind it that took aproximately 10-20 seconds to start to fade. C grabbed on to my shulder and stated that he wasn't feeling so good either. I forgot to mention it was about 90 degrees out with a heat index of like 110. ", "We both removed our shirts and proceeded to hold on for our dear souls. I looked at the guy in front me's back. He had a 'shroom tatoo and it appeared that the many freckles on his back were running away from the fungi, which symbolized a very powerful message to myself. Also above me I noticed a very pronounced Aztec meets tribal pattern rotating and flashing in the sky. At this point i could still see what was reality with what looked like a lysergic transperency superimposed over it.  My friend R noticed the scared look on my face and asked what was happening i cant remember if i answered or not but he left to get us some whater. About 20 minutes later (40 minutes into the trip) I forgot he left to get water and C and myself decided to search for some liquid on our own. As soon as we got on the walkway down the lawn we both tumbled down like bails of hay, head over foot over arm over arm. We landed next to a couple who both had blue hair and they offered us their beverage which was also blue ( i found this extremeley confusing). They tried to ask us what was wrong. We mistakenely told them we took 10 gels. They offered to take us to the trip tent but we stupidly decided we could find it ourselves.", "  By this time none of the music made sense it was just a collage of whirs and spliced audio resting on individual notes just to be spat forth (or backward) into the oblivion of my head space. It was at this moment we determined we were having a 'bad trip' (biggest understatement of my life. I told C it would be a good idea to make ourselves vomit in hopes of getting what hadn't absorbed into our stomachs out. When i walked into the bathroom it seemed like everyone was groaning and staring at me like they knew what was up. This only increased my paranoia. ", "I found a stall as quickly as i could and proceeded to stick my finger in my throught. there was piss and hair all over the floor (or was there?) but i didn't care. I could only dry-heave, and every time i looked in the water i could swear i saw a reflection of my group of friends standing behind me trying to pick me up. I could hear the 'music' from the stage in the background, but it sounded more like a spaceship whirring through the bathroom. Suddenly the ship took hold over the stall i was in and proceeded to flash a bright light down. when the flash dissaipated so did all the crazy sounds and visuals and it was actually silent except for the buzzing of the flourescents above me. Then i remembered C was in there too in the moment of silence i called out his name several times, but the only response i got was the ever steady echo of my voice in time-space.", "  I left the stall to look for him, but as soon as i stepped out of the restroom i say an official looking figure so i went up to him and asked 'have you seen my friend C' he looked at me like i was an idiot (and i was). He said ' you don't look so good, are you okay?'", "I figured this was my chance to get some help. I relized i was never gonna find C among the thousands of people there, so i said 'no idon't feel so good, i think i got too hot' ", "  As soon as I said that i blacked out. The next thing i remember i woke up laying on a pile of ice bags hearing someguy in the distance say 'this boy ain't suffering from no heatstroke, get him to a hospital.'  'Oh fuck!' I thought to myself and blacked out again.", "I awoke to an interally dimensional dream of lucidy without so much reality though. I thought i was being pushed through a hospital on a gurney at about 90 miles an hour. Hands were shooting out of the rooms trying to grab me, and i could hear people moaning. ", "Slowly the moaning turned to reality into the wailing of the siren of vanbulance that was taking me to the hospital. Across from me was a guy with his leg tucked behind the other. At first it appeared to me that he was floating in the air in front of an out of broadcast (snowy) television picure, and that his leg had been cut off and the blood was floating around the back of the vehicle in amazing aztec like shapes. (i ask the reader to keep in mind i had never seen anything outside of a tracer on acid before so this was all very........well...something.) Then the nurse in vanbulance started asking me questions:", "'C'mon you know your name, don't fuck with me!' (her)", "'xxx-10-9874' (me) (thats not my real # but i did remeber my real one at the time)", "I woke up in a hospital bed with some device around my dick an I.V. in my arm and my mom's finger in my mouth, chewing on it. I suddenly became aware of where i was. the noises had stopped but there were still multicolored blobs sliming up and down the walls. I decided i could handle that. I asked my mom what happened. She said she didn't know. (they didn't know drugs were involved yet). But right at that moment the doctor came in and said 'We found over 10,000 micrograms of LSD in his system. '10,000' i thought to myself 'thats how much Jim Morrison took when he jumped off that speaker landed flat on his face, jumped right back up and started dancing with the 'indian tribe' on stage. My mom looked at me with greatest dissapointment i've ever seen in anyones eyes. I collapsed inside and began to cry.", "To make the rest of this long story short: I was taken back home, grounded for 6 months ( and i mean grounded, my only sense of freedom was when i 'got' to mow the grass. I vowed to never trip on acid again. I have since then, but it has never been as good as it was before Ozzfest. ", "Now whenever i trip i get a fear in me and i have to take it with valium or Xanax handy, and almost always end up needing it. The main thing i learned from this situation was that if you do not respect a drug it will happily show you its power. I used to take tripping for granted doing it to deal with life on an everyday basis.", "Now I take it about every 6 months and i make the perfect setting with only one other person, soft lights, and plenty of Beatles vinyls. My advice to the person who reads this wonder what acid is like is: don't let this scare you, if you go in with fear your ego takes over and it is not a good idea to bring your ego into the garden. Acid can be very beautful, and enlightening. If you take more than you can handle, then you will be shown more about your world than you are ready to handle. Thank you for your time. Happy Tripping", "I was sitting in the living room listening to Pink Floyd's first album, The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, when I first noticed a slight change in atmosphere. The walls in my small but high-tech hovel, seemed to start undulating as if they actually breathed with a life of their own. I was startled at first but quickly realized that this must be a direct result of the natural inspiration in which I had imbibed. I slowly floated into a kind of separate reality, construed of a nature totally unknown to me before, but yet, so real. Or at least so it seemed to me at the time. I recalled vague, complicated words written by Aldous Huxley in his treatise on mescaline.... The Doors Of Perception. Chairs and curtains, I KNEW what he meant. The lines, the shapes, the colour. These thoughts all came to me and meandered about and through my head like fleeting spirits from beyond reason. Thats when I realized that profound changes were taking place inside my very head. I was never to be the same again I thought, this is the end all of end alls. This is the key to that realm that has always just been out of reach, just outside of my limited perception. It was as Huxley had said, the flood gates had been opened. I searched in vain for a reason but all reason had floated away like the smoke from my cigarette. My ego had died. My SELF had dissolved into an effervescent cauldron of teeming geometrics. I was one with all. To me, that brought great peace, no fear, and no reason to reason. It was if a great burden had been lifted from my shoulders, I was free. And in that instant I realized, we all are free. It always has been and always will be a matter of perception. And we hold the key.", "I had reached a peak, a plateau of sparkling clarity and conciousness. The world was sound, a vibrating molecular dance from the infinitesimally small to the infinitesimally vast, deeper than anything I'd ever imagined. I looked out the window and saw machine clouds churning through an endless sky. I saw light and colour and vacillating patterns possessed of an indescribable essence. I realized that the room and world around me were alive and that all things spring from the Divine Ground. This must have been what the ancients felt when they spoke of the Great Spirit and in my minds eye, I could almost see an old shaman standing by his fire, arms outstretched to the heavens, with spirits dancing all around him, in the shadows... ", "There is ancient wisdom and knowledge here, something that prescinds the truths we've come to accept in this civilization we've built around us. Something that transcends dogma, religion, culture, all the established ways and mores of society. And for a time I'm ecstatic about being apart of and witness to this deeper truth. I found myself wishing everyone could glimpse this ...path, this window. Surely no one could go through this experience and not come out of it a little more fulfilled or centered, a little more whole...", "There is also a certain amount of fear here. This I found on introspection, to be inevitable considering the complexities and fear that pervades the world around us. But it didn't last, ecstatic communion and hope won out as I realized that I held the key to keep, or let go of, the fears that I possessed. Like I said before, it's only a matter of perception...", "I upset the oversoul during my spring break.  I had said that I would give up synthetic drugs (i.e LSD and rolling) for lent this year.  I'm not Catholic, (or Christian for that matter), but I like the idea of sacrifice to a higher cause.  But...It just so happens that my spring break was during the beginning of lent, so now I'm faced with a dilemma.  ", "I had smoked some home-grown from my older sister's plant; I had about 3 good bowls left, and now my friend has enticed me to eat some papers from the bowling alley of all places.  I normally would have resisted, but my friend Jonathon's best friend Randy was tripping for his first time and they needed some stimulation and games.  I'm an experienced tripper and love being the entertainer/parental unit of the group.", "  Randy drove a stick, but was too far gone to drive. Jonathon didn't drive a stick, and that left me at the helm. The whole way I kept thinking of my promise to Jesus.  Pretty soon into the car ride, we saw a beautiful church with multiple stain-glass windows.  I felt calmed.  Soon, however, as we wonder through the streets of Atlanta, we continue seeing churches.  As we passed different portions of the city, we continue to see Churches.  I told my friends that it was bizarre because the last time I had tripped in Atlanta, I was at a club called The Church, you guessed it... an old church.  I had driven around with bad directions, a head full of paper, and vague memories of how to get there.  I ended up there that night, and this night in question.  My friend Randy said, 'what club?  What church are you talking about?'  As I pulled up to the red light, I pointed at The Church!  (We had taken randomn turns and twists all around, fully unplanned.) We freak out on Atlanta a little more and then start driving home.", "  We pass some more churches and pull into Chickfil-a for the crackhead sunrise.  As I was looking into the clouds being pierced with light, I felt an overwhelming calm.  I saw in the clouds a massive migration of people whom I had never met.  They looked like western settlers placed on a highway, and they were being ejected from heaven.  I don't know what others would say about my experience, or how they would have handled it for that matter.  I had a received a spiritual warning.  I felt the awesome presence of the Almighty, Muhammed, Buddha, and the general oversoul that connects us to the past and to each other.  I can still feel it.", "It was the New Year's celebration of 1995, and I found myself at my first rave, with my first hit of acid in my hand.  It was an experience that was long overdue, and one which I highly looked forward to.  I consulted just about every friend I knew who tried that wonderful drug which I was holding onto with immense anticipation.  I knew all about the LSD experience, for preparation was my safety harness against bad trips.  Finally, as I put the tiny white paper in my mouth, my stomach quenched with nervousness and fear.", "'Was I really prepared to experience this?' I thought.  But as the wonderful sounds of Trance filled my ears with bliss, the fear quickly diminished.", "After about 45 minutes I was thinking to myself, either one of my best friends ripped me off, or I must be immune to this compound.  Then, in that very second, fantasy merged with reality, as a cartoon train literally came out of one of the television sets which I was viewing.  It circled the room and returned back to the world it came from.  From that moment, everything around me was surreal.  Colors were so intense that I was in awe of how limiting visual perception is in our everyday lives.  Music acquired a life of its own, and it was a part of me.  People around me became fellow explorers in a quest to reach ultimate bliss and fulfillment.  Life was so full and wonderful at that moment, that my only wish was immortality in this beautiful state.", "The trip was a wonderful journey, one which had an immense impact on my life.  Since being introduced to this divine world, my outlook on life changed.  Beauty of everyday life made its presence know to me long after the trip was over.  I learned to see the extraordinary in the ordinary.  In other words, LSD was my window to a heavenly bliss, which in many forms persisted and embodied itself in life as I know it.", "I recently took a dose of liquid LSD while on Celexa, a prescription antidepressant.  I have been taking 30mg of Celexa daily for about nine months.  Celexa is an SSRI, and 30mg is a fairly low dosage, especially for my body size.", "This was the first time in approximately 4 months that I had used any psychoactive drug.  For me, the 'speedy' feeling with LSD begins about 30 minutes after dosing, with very obvious muscle tensing and the onset of visuals occuring at about 45 minutes.  ", "I took an initial dose of what was equivalent to approximately one tab.  This time, however, after 45 minutes I felt slightly giddy, but otherwise felt none of the normal reactions I have to acid.  A friend of mine who dosed at about the same time (who does not use antidepressants) reported the same thing, at which point we both had another dose each.", "After another 30 minutes my friend began experiencing his normal reaction to acid, however I still remained relatively unaltered.  The giddy feeling remained, a sensational vaguely similar to GHB but muted.  After about 2 hours I felt almost normal.", "After consulting some knowledgable people, it seems that my reaction was a normal interaction between hallucinagens and SSRI's.  ", "An addendum to this report is that, three days later, I intentionally skipped my daily dose of Celexa (which is fairly harmless at such a low dosage) and ate ~3-4g of mushrooms.  I felt very strong disassociation and intense visuals.", "In conclusion, it seems that even a very small dosage of Celexa can dampened or cancelled an LSD trip entirely, while skipping one dose resulted in a normal mushroom trip.  Again, I take a small dose of Celexa, and I do not know if skipping a larger dose will have other side effects.", "It was my first time experimenting with acid and I was really anxious to try it. I took my hit at about 1am and it took good effect at 2am. I remember I was lying on the floor watching this weird movie, it looked like a screen saver. Weird images just kept coming out of the screen and they were getting faster and faster. I could actually feel myself getting scared, so I had the people I was with turn off the movie. I then started to stare at the ceiling which had neat patterns all over it, then the patterns started moving and shooting all over the ceiling. ", "The next thing I knew, I was floating up to the ceiling and I was laughing. Once I reached the ceiling, I turned over and saw myself lying on the floor. I started talking to my human self and I was actually talking back!! My ghost self and human self were having a deep conversation about my life! What seemed like 20 minutes was really 3 hours and I finally snapped out of it. When I came to, I decided to smoke a cigarette. I could feel the smoke shoot down my lungs and I could feel it moving around in my body. I moved to the couch and some of the non-tripping people that were there decided to put on these scary masks and scare us. I knew it was fake but it seemed so real, and behind them I saw a flashing white light and people from like the 1940s, ballroom dancing and whispering my name over and over again. I finally stopped tripping at around 2 the next day and I would not recommend this to anyone.", "I took LSD at least 100 times between 1968-1972.  Generally I approached it as a scientific experiment rather than a 'party drug'. ", "Thirty years later, those experiences stand out as some of the most remarkable of my life, although I am convinced that the benefits are NOT cumulative.  That is, I probably derived no more benefit from doing it 100 times than if I had only done it 5 times.  Perhaps even once was enough.", "I was always left with the nagging feeling that I had come very close to grasping some ultimate truth, but I was never quite satisfied that I had really gotten there.  Hence the need to go back to it over and over again.", "Aside from discovering (or not) any ultimate truths, I certainly became aware of, and awed by, the incredibly intricate workings of the mind.  It was truly fascinating to watch my mind working on many levels at the same time, creating all sorts of curious realities and unusual interpretations.  ", "And therein lies the sleeping tiger of LSD.  New interpretations of reality come flying from every direction, and not all of them are warm and cozy.  When the world of all possibilities is unleashed it can get extremely frightening.  ", "So even though I would make careful preparations to ensure positive LSD experiences (and in fact they WERE positive for the most part), there were more than a few times that it became paralyzingly clear that I was not in control of anything that was happening.  In those situations one hopes to just 'go with the flow', but that can be easier said than done.", "I know that many of you have read a lot of crap and propaganda about LSD, and I want you to know right off that I am NO EXPERT. I am just trying to tell you what I have experienced.", "Late last year, I think in september, I used LSD for the first, and as of now, the last time. I dropped one tab with a friend of mine (who had dropped before), around 3 PM, (my first mistake, it was to late in the day). We had smoked up first, so for a while I wasn't really sure if I was high or tripping... (I didn't know if it had kicked in yet). After a while though, like 45 minutes, it became apparent that I was. I started to get really anxious, and I started to feel very strange. I asked my friend how he was feeling, and he told me that it was kicking in for him to. I glanced over at a clock, it was around 4. For what seemed like three hours, we just sat there, laughing at things... the most normal things seemed to me like the strangest, and everything made me laugh. I looked over at the clock again... it had been like 2 minutes.", "My friend and I just kinda sat around in my basement laughing at stuff for like 4 hours... and then he went home, around 8.", "I assumed that once I was alone, it would be more fun, and that I would be able to really let loose. BIG MISTAKE. It was my first time tripping, as I noted above, and I didn't know what I was getting myself into. To make a long story short, my trip became the trip from hell, I was scared out of my mind. However, the trip itself is NOT the important part. The important part of what I have to say comes after the trip.", "Now before I continue I should mention that I am OCD, because that I think is relivent to what I am about to tell you.", "About two months after my trip... Yes, it took me that long to figure this out... I began to notice that things were different then before... only I had the hardest time remembering if they happened before the trip, (which I doubt now). I was still having visuals! (and I still to this day am having visuals) Lots of the effects NEVER wentaway.  Now I am not talking flashbacks, I am talking 24/7 from after my trip to present day. These effects are not as strong as on my trip, but they are apparent.", "I went to a doctor recently... a psychiatrist... (I cant spell for my life). She looked up in once of her books, and found some disorder... a VERY RARE occurance, of LSD users who apparently suffered similar side effects. She noted that people who already have disorders such as OCD or schizophrenia or other also, have a greatly increased risk... anyways thats what she told me.", "I dont know what this means, because I havn't learned all this crap that she has and maybe some of you have. All I know is that I tripped, and my trip never stopped. Maybe OCD contributed... I dont know for sure. However I havn't been able to find much about what I just told you about anywhere on the web, so I thought I would try and post it on Erowid and see if anything positive comes of it.", "I sincerely hope this helps somebody... in some way.", "[erowid note: It sounds like he's referring to Hallucinogen Persisting Perceptual Disorder an uncommon, but not unique, side effect in some people.  For more about HPPD, check out HPPD Online.]", "I never used to have dreams until I started using LSD.  It's been about a month since I first tripped and have done it a few more time since.  EVERY single night when I go to bed, I've had a very memorable, vivid dream.  I  love it.  I even look forward to going to bed because I know I'll visit some entirely new world when I'm sleeping.  None of the dreams are nightmares either.", "I have taken LSD (at least I'm pretty sure it was) 3 times in my life, all bought from the same person, and probably all the same type, however all 3 experiences were remarkably different.  I suspect the acid was homemade because the hits were not perfectly square, and one had an apparently penciled checkmark on it for some reason.", "The first time I took it was with a (now former) friend, let's call him Mike.  We had planned a camping trip for the occasion, so he got his quad out and we rode up over the slate dumps, and on a hill where an older friend lived, let's call him Frank.", "Frank had a sloped yard with quad trails running up into the woods, so we rode up a bit on the top of a hill and set up camp.  Around 9:00 or so we decided to take the hit.  We only had one hit, so we had to cut it in half.  We had no way of doing this so we walked down to Frank's house.", "We cut it in half with nail clippers and dropped the hits.  We then walked to the edge of town and sat on a pile of cardboard for about an hour.  Nothing happened.  We went back to Frank's and another acquaintance stopped by, let's call him Jeff.  ", "I bought $20 in weed from Jeff, which turned out to be a very large but, with the provision that I smoke a joint with everyone.  Seemed like a good deal to me.  After smoking a joint on his porch, we all went inside.  ", "I had a bit of a weed buzz going on, and this was about an hour and 45 minutes after we'd taken the hit.  Suddenly EVERYTHING went weird.  I looked around and nearly forgot where I was.  Then I looked at one of Frank's children who just stared at me, and time seemed to freeze.  The child looked unnatural, and out of place.", "It's a bit hazy from there on.  I remember Jeff leaving and Frank going to sleep.  We left Frank's house and stood on his porch laughing for about 15 minutes before he came outside and chased us away, since he had to work the next day.  ", "We walked back up to our campsite, laughing the whole way.  We then attempted to gather firewood, and somehow got a fire going.  I remember on the other side of the river, on top of the hill, the lines of house lights and cellular phone towers seemed to blink and dance about.", "We continued to smoke weed the whole time, and seemed to enjoy throwing coleman fuel on the fire and laughting hysterically.  I eventually went to sleep in the tent, after hours of laying there hearing the fire crackling, which sounded so intense I had to make sure it wasn't the tent that was actually burning!", "The following morning I had little if any feeling from the drug, and Frank and his friend came to make sure we weren't dead I suppose and we smoked a joint with them.", "It was a very pleasant experience, from a mere half of a hit of acid.  Price: $5.00 / hit (so $2.50 for my trip)", "I decided I wanted to try this again!  I went and scored 4 hits from my sorce.  Then me and my other friend, let's call him bob, planned a camping trip.  We would walk the railroad tracks and setup camp when we were ready.  I decided that the railroad tracks would be an interesting scene.", "Our concept of time wasn't very good, as the only thing we had to go on was a shortwave radio we occasionally picked up the 'time channel' then scrambled to remember what our GMT offset was.", " We took a half hit each around 11am, and began walking. About an hour or so later of non-constant walking with frequent water breaks (the 4 gallons of water we brought being the LIFE SAVERS of the journey), we felt very little and decided to take another half hit each, for a grand total of one hit each.", "No sooner did we take the second half hit then we began feeling strange.  This may have simply been psychological, but it seems that something kicked in at that point.  We continued walking.  ", "We both began feeling weirder and weirder.  We encountered, of all things, a docked boat in the middle of nowhere by the water, with children swimming near it.  This surreal event may have been the straw that broke the camel's back, because at this point we began to see spots in the sky moving about, and colors were more pronounced.", "We then walked through the next town up the railroad tracks.  We had been walking for hours and (probably due to the acid) we did not seem to be bothered at all by the 90 degree heat!  We walked from the railroad tracks to the a dirt road we were farmiliar with, and walked to a fresh water spring to replenish our water supply.", "At this point, we began to become tired.  We made the decision not to camp but instead to walk on to the NEXT town down the tracks, where bob's sister lived.  So we walked and we walked and we walked.", "We eventually made it only to find that his sister was not home!  Luckily after about 5 minutes of walking towards his even farther-away cousin's house, his brother-in-law drove past and we finally got rides home.  Once home I took a shower, and Mike (same one from the last story) stopped by with his friend let's call him Al (the acid supplier) and we smoked a bit of weed.  By this time my trip had subsided.", "This was, it would seem, a MILD trip.  I experienced obvious changes in perception, but very little visuals, buoyancy, or giddiness from the previous HALF dosage.  Mike tells me that it was because I took it in the day time instead of at night but I find that hard to beleive.", "The remaining two hits me and Bob had planned to take at his cousin's house (an old farm-house) that he often housesitted for.  Instead, around 10pm one night I had the spontanious urge to take the hit, so I called him up.", "We went to his room, which is very trippily decorated (is trippily a word?) complete with christmas lights, blacklight shit everywhere, and playboy centerfolds and beer posters galore.  ", "We took one hit each, turned on the christmas lights and listened to pink floyd's the wall (a classic of course).  After around 45 minutes my arms went numb.  I told this to him and he thought nothing of it.  ", "After about 15 or 20 more minutes of floyd we both had some serious effects.  I was really starting to freak out from my claustrophobia being severely intensified in the small room.  At one point I looked at him and said 'We GOTTA get out of here!' He had a panicked look on his face and shook his head.  We just couldn't take the scenery.", "The walk downstairs was a REAL challenge! I had difficulty balancing and even walking slowly down the stairs felt like a ride at an amusement park.  And the icing on the cake, his mother was downstairs, and we had to sneak by her.  He explained that we were going for a walk.", "We decided to hit the town (as boring as it is)  We first walked to the ballpark, sat down in the dugout and had a cigarette.  The fence facing the field was moving fast.  We continued walking through town.  At one point, walking past a church, I actually had NO idea where I was, nor did I care.  For a brief moment, I was completely null and void.", "I had no sense of where I was, what I was doing, and yet it didn't worry me.  I just kept walking.  We ended up at the locks and dam.  We sat by the foggy river for awhile and walked back to Bob's house.  We then played a game of Wayne Gretzky's 3d hockey for the n64, which was quickly abandoned when neither of us could follow it at all.", "We then, for some reason, proceeded to take our shoes off and RUN barefoot to the local fire hall to buy a can of pop from the machine.  We returned to his house, and made another trip to the locks, then we disbanded and returned to our respective homes.", "It was about 5am when I came home.  I watched speed racer then attempted to go to sleep.  When I closed my eyes I saw a strange phenomenon.  I saw a ball of light that would expand into a thick vertical bar, move around, then disappear briefly.  I eventually fell asleep and had no effect when I woke up (at about 3pm!) Overall this was my best experience with lsd.", "In conclusion, my trips were somewhat mild in comparison to some of the stories I have read.  My experiences with LSD have been calm, pleasing, and all occured during good mind sets (I read all about set and setting, etc before I took the drug).  If you asked me if i'd ever do it again, I wouldn't have an answer.  It depends on where I am at the time and such.  If you asked me if I'd reccomend LSD to you, i would have no answer for that either.  I can only say that it's quite a ride, nothing like that of marijuana.  From what i hear it can be even more intense depending on dosage and quality.  In any case, that's my story.", "This is the story of how events can turn your trip into the most nasty thing that will ever happen to you. Words can never really describe what has happened to your soul after such an event, in fact it is always hard to remember exactly how you felt as your world melts away.", "In England there's this festival called Glastonbury. In 1997, it was a mud bath as it was raining continuously. With this backdrop, a group of us met an LSD dealer. We all bought one each, most only took half but I was having trouble splitting it so I just thought 'sod it' and did it all. For the first three or four hours it was great, I won't go into it as everyone who has done it knows how great it can be. After a while though, I got very heavy-legged and really wanted to sit down and I also got a bit of a panic attack. I had heard that drinking alcohol was a good way to get rid of any LSD fright. The only thing available was beer, so I got a round in but most people didn't drink their beer so I had it all. Several pints. My fear was slightly subdued. We went back to this girl's tent to sit down but pretty soon I was needing a piss. So off I went to piss, but it got pretty scary on my own with the sounds becoming all strange and my vision was filled with creatures of horror and the floor was a swirling mass of mud with flashing lights reflected on it. I held it together pretty well as I had done it all before. But my head fell apart when I realised I was unable to find the tent my friends were in. The panic hit me as my legs were getting more and more heavy, I really wanted to sit down but the mud prevented me from doing so. The visuals got more intense and they got even more horrific. I kept seeing people bleeding everywhere and there was a terrible savage laughter coming from every direction. At this point I just wanted out, but as soon as you think that you've totally lost it. ", "I had a vague idea of where my tent was, as it was near a major path, so I decided that I had to get there, that felt like safety if only I could find it. I walked through the mud and it seemed to pull me down with every step, the floor seemed to be alive. There were flashing lights everywhere, flying around my head, and the laughing had become demonic. If someone had told me the devil laughs like that I would believe them, it was that scary, that evil. I was walking up a hill and my thoughts became more crazed as I got more scared. I got to the top and a terrible stench of sh*t hit me. The rancid fumes filled my nostrils but I continued on into the field and there weren't any tents in this part of the field and it suddenly hit me that this was the field were they dumped all the sh*t from the toilets (it wasn't of course). A wave of paranoia hit me, my fear of things I was seeing was gone but I suddenly felt that every single person in the festival had made me think these terrible thoughts and scared me enough to trick me into walking into the field of sh*t. I suddenly realised that everyone was evil in ways that I could never have imagined. I continued to panic but I now wanted to show everyone that I didn't care what they had done to me. ", "I walked and walked, constantly surpressing the urge to start screaming, and I finally found my tent. A wave of great feelings filled me and I suddenly realised how gone I had got. All the fear left me and I started to enjoy the trip for a few seconds. I even managed to laugh at my stupid thoughts from seconds before. As I got into the tent though, a most powerful smell of sh*t hit me. All the panic, all the fears filled me again. I was covered in sh*t, my clothes were covered in this rancid brown sh*t. The view that everyone was conspiring against me returned. These people were driving me mad. I stripped off and started sniffing my clothes, throwing each article out of the tent once I could not find any sh*t stains. I realised I was talking to myself, saying 'this is the worse day of my life' again and again. My friend's younger brother was in the tent and he woke up and acted very strangely (I think that he had never seen a person act so scared and so crazy), and it just confirmed that he too was in on this ruse to drive me nuts. ", "I tried to sleep but I felt the tent was grabbing at me and strange voices were calling to me and the visions in my own head must have been sent from satan himself (well, that's how I felt as the time). I kept talking to myself. I really was mad at this point and I swore to myself that if I survived I would never do this gain. I think I was crying, it really felt like my brain and body was being savaged from within me and that I was going to die or worse. Words can never really describe what I felt, only a person who has had a terrible trip will know what I mean. It was a situation where I knew what true evil was, I could feel it all around me clawing at my soul, and everyone was involved, and I mean everyone in the world. If hell is like that, it is worse than I could have imagined before that bad trip. The story ends well though. ", "Slowly I calmed down, and even managed to control my feeble mind enough to get dressed and go to the toilets. When daylight finally arrived, things felt good. I saw that the reason the tent smelt was because I had kicked a stray cow pat on the way into the tent, there was only sh*t on one of my shoes. I really wasn't covered in sh*t and the sun was rising for the first time that weekend. I felt reborn. I went for a walk and saw the field I had been in, it had been NEXT to the place where they put the sh*t but the field itself was fine.", "I swore that I would change from that point, and I did, but it still took me a long time to get over my night in hell. I would say to anyone taking LSD not to. You may have one great trip, you may have 100, but when the bad one gets you it will drive you to the point where your mind is no longer your own, and there's many people who have been mentally lost in this world.", "This wasn't my first time tripping. I had a few times before, mostly driving around with friends out in the boon-docks of my city so as to avoid cops and have free roam of the road. Gas and go's were commonplace. One night we went touched through 4 or 5 counties. I couldn't even tell you all the places we went. So like I said, i was experienced in tripping, but as i was told later i had never really tripped until this night.", "It started out good, I dropped with...hmmm I dont know how many other people were tripping that night, which never helps anything. Anyways, about an hour after i dropped i started getting the body buzz. I'm a huge nin fan and I love to listen while im wheeling so i flipped on the fragile and started getting into it. Later, still listening to the cd i was sitting in my friends living room by myself as they were playing cards out in the dining room and i was in NO shape to play and plus id rather be listening to music while tripping than concentrating on a game and wasting a perfectly good buzz.", "As i was sitting there staring at the wood paneling across from me watching purple sparks fling between the splits in the design i glanced over and on the wall to my left was a fake rock design, and in the dark between the stone looking parts there was a river of color flowing through it. at this point i had decided this was some pretty good shit and continued tripping balls. When i looked back at the wood paneling it looked like there was a doorway of some kind in it and i swear if i had walked over there i couldve gone right through it. ", "Sitting, comfortable as hell listening to my music i couldnt have been any happier at that moment. then i happened to hear my friends talking and thought it was about me and somehow i mixed everything they said into something bad about me. i thought i was like doing something with my body and didnt even realize it. i looked down at myself, nothing that i noticed, so i ignored it and went back to watching the wall. then it happened again. i kept asking myself what i was doing weird, im just sitting here i thought. but they see something else or so i was going to believe.", "I started getting a little antsy making weird noises and being extremely self conscience. then they really did start talking about me, nothing bad, just wondering what i was flipping out about. which just sent me into a frenzy. i got up and sat down, got up, sat down i dont know how many times and after awhile i just got up and went outside to get some fresh air to maybe clear my head. but boy did that not work.  My friend had this bronze casting of like an old pirate ship propped against the house on the porch and when i looked it it seemed to grow like 2 feet taller than it was then shrink back down then back up again. I was liking that (kind of) but the thoughts of them inside were still nagging me and since my perception of time was screwed i was thinking i getting a little over do for coming down and besides, this trip was getting a little out of hand.", "I went back inside and sat down with the guys and watched them play cards trying to concentrate on the game to keep my head straight but it wasnt working. i could barely hear what they were saying and nothing was making any sense. i tried to explain to them what was going on with me and they said they understood but it wouldnt get through to me and i just kept getting worse, it was like i was in another dimension.", "I eventually started thinking perma-trip and thats when things hit rock bottom. i could see like nothing but visuals, more than i had ever had before. i was smoking cigarettes like a fiend and it seemed that noone understood me. one of my friends suggested taking a cold shower, i had heard that helps kill your buzz so i went back to the shower got undressed put the water on freezing cold and jumped in, 3 seconds later i was out screaming from the cold, i know when you're tripping you cant feel the cold too much, but thats just how cold it was. when my feet hit the bathroom floor i looked down and it was just fell apart.", "I panicked. i yelled for help and started to run out before stopping to realize i didnt have any clothes on. someone came back and tried to come in but that wasnt happening before i got dressed. after i calmed down a little i came out in the living room again and started to freak out a little on the music because it was really fucking with my head. so after many attempts at a simple task i was able to turn the cd player off. my head still completely clouded i decided i had had enough, layed down on the couch and was out like a light.", "I seem to have a keen ability to do that. the next day i swore off tripping forever. that was just too damned scary for me. but months later i got a craving and tripped again and it was the best trip i had ever had in my life. i knew what to expect and whenever i thought something bad i just remembered, 'when i go to sleep and i wake up in the morning everything will be back normal' which always puts a big grin on my face and makes me think of what a great trip it's been. god, i love acid.", "Have you ever 'controlled' acid? Well, not only did I, but I taught two others as well.", "My friend Rob did it for his first time this weekend.  Buddy Jeff and I took him to the hills.  It hit fast, we took it at 9am, and by 10 - the trees were waving.", "Several weird things happened during this trip, and might I say that this trip is the best time I've had in my entire life, never have I felt such joy.  By the way, I'm the guy that done it over 300 times (yeah a lot of good times in highschool).  I'm 25 now.", "Rob handled it perfectly.  Not even a hint of any possible apprehensive feelings.  The clouds came out and put on a fantastic display of vibrant colors, a brilliant array of spectrum in the clouds by the angle of the sun.  The hawks flew around us, sometimes pausing in the spectrum as if they knew we were watching.  Also, even though it was Rob's first time, and time flies when you're having fun - he was TELLING TIME correctly.  It boggled us, he would be exact to the minute as far as telling how long it's been or what time it was at any given moment.  He was at one with time.", "After spending a few hours out there, we headed back to have my girl pick us up so we could go to my house.  On the way back, the first BREAKTHROUGH #1 happened.  As I'm walking, I accidently dropped the plastic wrapper of my cigarettes.  I continued walking and HEARD the hills hiss at me.  I don't know if I heard the hills hissing at me, or if I actually heard the sound of the little plastic hitting the leaf that it landed on.  Seems unreasonable for a human to be able to detect such a minute sound, but who knows?", "At this point I will give all my fellow trippers a wonderful present, here you go:  This is a method that Rob, it being his first time, brought to my attention.  You know when you're trippin' real hard and it starts to get kinda intense?  Well, a lot of people may get a worried look on their face that can set off a bad trip.  Here's the NEW solution, and it works!  Rob did this a million times, and it was PERFECT!  You know what he did?  Simple.  When it got intense, or when something awesome happened, he would whistle.  Yup.  Just a plain little 'Whew' type of whistle.  That sound and the act of doing just lets you 'wash' the intensty and absorb everything, while maintaining yourself.  MAKE A NOTE OF IT, REMEMBER IT, and try it next time.", "Now for the house.  My girl took some and we took more so we could experience the night.  We did, and off we went, into Wonderland.  I lead the night, being our guide and host of the show.  I talked us through everything and took us on many mental journeys.  A funny thing was pointed out by my girl.  She said that I 'spoke with the weather', meaning every time I got more intense, the wind would pick up.  Anytime I would shut up, the wind would DIE completely.  This happened four times that she could recollect.  I personally think that the breakthrough here was that I must have been feeding off the wind myself.  BREAKTHROUGH #2.", "Back in the house, we were seated.  I began to explain to my girl and Rob how they can control the melt.  I told them to focus on whether the walls are melting down or up.  Then I told to tell the acid to STOP melting, and turn around and go the opposite direction....it worked!  Both of them were able to dictate whether they wanted the wall to melt up or to melt down.  BREAKTHROUGH #3.  I gave both of them a new power.  And powerful they did feel.  We felt like Gods, we could do anything.", "The grand finale of the night was when I was telling a funny story (forgot the story, sorry).  The funniest thing is this:  As I'm getting to the punchline of the story, I begin to laugh, I laugh so hard it literally buckles me, and sends me bending over and that was it.  I come back up with tears in my eyes, and no story to tell.  Just a big smile on my face telling both of them that I've never laughed so hard in my life that it actually BUCKLED me.", "Acid is my personal treasure.  Some people are afraid of it, and they should be, because obviously they have problems with themselves.", "If your soul is pure you have nothing to fear.  The only bad trips come out of doubts about yourself, if you have not yet cleansed yourself of the sins YOU feel you are guilty of.  Release yourself, free your mind, and fly.  I am clean and reborn.", "The first time I ever tripped it was with my brother at our parent's cottage in ontario, on lake erie. a perfect trip setting if ever there was one. It had just gotten dark, and this is a rather remote location so when it gets dark it's DARK. We were just starting to peak, and were in the process of building a bonfire, when I glanced up toward the lake and noticed a light on the horizon.", "Keep in mind, this is my first time tripping, and I'm having a great time--laughing my ass off, digging the visuals, etc.", "Anyway, I see this light and sort of stop and start to examine it and figure out what the hell it is. Often you could see the lights from ships going by way out in the lake, and occasionally there would be an oil rig test drilling. Both these things were sources of light, and considering the warpedness of my perception, I wasn't sure my light wasn't just a ship or oil rig, but it sure didn't look like it.", "As I watched the light, I determined that it wasn't moving horizontally, but it appeared to be getting bigger!! closer, maybe, I thought, still figuring it was some man-made, explainable object.", "At the time I was a college sophmore in computer science, and my brother was a junior in metalurgical engineering. Neither one of us was stupid or especially drawn toward the super-natural.", "'it's too big to be a ship, and i think it's getting bigger' I said.", "'a weather baloon maybe' I said, trying as best I could given my mindset to come up with a rational explanation, when inside I ALREADY KNEW it was a messenger from another planet!!", "'no, weather baloons don't glow like that!!' he said.", "By now the thing was getting really huge, and was obviously glowing with it's own light.", "my brother tends to be even more skeptical than I when it comes to things of this nature, but I think he actually agreed with me.", "I thought to myself, as I watched this glowing disk get bigger and bigger, brighter and brighter before my eyes, this is it. This will be mankinds first contact with an intelligent alien life form. the occupants of that spaceship, which is apparently headed straight for us, will come face to face with humanity, for the first time ever, and we, two tripping fools, will be humanity's representatives.", "I was convinced not only that this was going to happen, but that it would be an historic occasion. I wasn't afraid; rather I looked forward to being my species' ambassador to these weary space travellers. I wasn't even scared that they were going to take me away; I thought it would be neat to see the inside of their spaceship.", "Well, we stared at it for another minute or two, and when it got to the point where it was obvious that we were looking at a half-disk, I blurted out 'it's the fucking MOON!!!!!!!!!!!!'. We proceeded to roll in the sand laughing for about a half hour, then continued with our trip.", "The trip I will describe here occured when I was a college student almost 20 years ago.  I feel compelled to share this, because I believe a good LSD trip can be an important and enlightening experience for many people.  In fact, I believed then, and still do, that the world would be a better place if more people went on a good LSD trip. A bad trip, on the other hand, can be extremely frightening.  I hope this report will help travelers avoid the bad trip.", "While in college, I took LSD at least a dozen times -- probably more.  Before embarking on that first trip, I read as much as I could on LSD.  Most interesting to me, for example, was the story of Albert Hoffman and his famous bicycle ride.  Also in my readings, I was very careful to note the advice on preparing a good setting.  Most crucial, I think, is to arrange things so that any source of anxiety can be avoided.  There are three basic rules: 1) If there are any particularly worrisome tasks you must attend to, take care of them *before* taking LSD; 2) the setting should be completely non-threatening, and devoid of any pressure on you to do things you wouldn't want to do; and 3) share the trip with people you trust -- people who would not criticize you or threaten you in any way.", "Whenever I've followed these rules, LSD has given me some of the most memorable and meaningful experiences in my life.  The most consisent impression has been that love for all others makes perfect sense, and that hate and violence is utterly senseless and illogical.  I can still vividly recall nature outings with close friends, trips to amusement parks and the love I felt for others I saw there having fun, and seeing colorful fish while snorkeling in the ocean.  All of these experience were intense with the most pure and good feelings of love in a perfect world.", "Having had such pleasant trips over and over, however, I got a bit reckless with the setting one night, and embarked on the most terrifying experience of my life.  Early one winter evening, I and 3 of my close friends each took one hit of 'Red Phoenix' blotter -- an imprint which probably no longer exists, but had provided us with very pleasant trips in the past.  Right off, there were a couple of things wrong that I chose to ignore.  First of all, we had no plan for the night.  We just chose to drop acid, and make up the rest as the night progressed.  Big mistake.  Always plan out a safe, and comforting setting for the entire trip.  Second, one of our fellow travelers was Gary -- a close friend who I loved, but who was abrupt , unpredictable and, I secretly felt, potentially dangerous.", "Within one hour of taking the blotter, we suddenly decided to go to our college's Friday night free movie, which happend to be 'American Werewolf in London.'  Always at these movies, there's a long line waiting to enter the theater.  Cutting in line was, naturally, against the established ettiquette, but there were always inconsiderate types around who would screw everyone else so they could get ahead.  I always played by the rules, and accepted my place at the end of the line if I hadn't been thoughtful enough to arrive early for a prime spot. Gary, however, had no conscience whatsoever.  He spotted a pal of his toward the front of the line, and went to 'talk' to him, insisting that we all conveniently join him in cutting in front of all the others who were patiently waiting.  Standing there in the cold winter air, I could hear the grumblings behind me from those who were in no way appreciative our our blatant breach of ettiquette.  I kept my back turned to them, but could just feel the sting of the mental daggers pointed at us. ", "When we finally entered the theater, I didn't have that annonymous feeling I normally have in big crowds. When the four of us took our seats toward the front, I could still feel the daggers from behind.  I remember wishing the projectionist would hurry up and turn down the house lights so others couldn't see us.  When the movie started, so did the bad part of the trip.  If you've ever seen 'American Werewolf in London,' you may recall that the opening scenes feature pictures of hill covered countryside, that sort of blend into each other.  This seemed very weird, and I wasn't sure if it was really happening on screen or if I was halucinating.  Being a scary movie, 'American Werewolf'  had all the tricks to make you feel in danger.  Already uncomfortable, the movie didn't help me feel any better.  Little by little with each scene, I began to notice that the faces of the movie characters began to melt.  As a character would move, the pale color of their face would smear across the screen.  Everything else in the picture on the screen would look okay, it was just the faces that would melt and smear.  I began to worry that the real world would begin to melt just like the movie, and that if it did, I wouldn't be able to see well enough to leave the theater when the house lights came on.  I told Gary about the problem, and he said the faces were melting on him, too.  So, we both got up to leave.  As we did, I heard someone behind us say, 'Chicken Shit!'  I laugh at this now, but at the time the sarcastic remark only increased the chill of an already cold night.", "The two of us went back to the appartment of one of the trippers who stayed in the theater.  The appartment was cold, but we tried to get comfortable by watching t.v.  Coudn't do it -- melting faces.  Then we tried music.  The music sounded completely garbled and I couldn't make any sense of it whatsoever, so we turned off the stereo.  With no music or t.v., Gary and I sat in the cold appartment doing nothing. Bored, Gary suggested we go to a frat boy bar to pick up sorrority girls.  Yeah, right, while on a bad acid trip!  There's no holding Gary back on anything, though, so he bolted and I stayed in the cold appartment alone -- no t.v., no music, no one to talk to...  ", "The only thing interesting to look at was the world map hanging on the wall.  Being a political map, each country was represented by a different color.  Also, the oceans had varrying shades of blue to indicate water depth.  All of these colors were sort of pulsating, growing and subsiding in intensity.  The map also looked like it was flapping against the wall, as though the bottom corners of the map were not attached to the wall, and a fan was blowing against it.  In fact, I was certain that by the looks of the map that was flapping around and the cold air in the room, there must be a fan on somewhere.  But, I looked and looked everywhere and could find no fan.  I went up to touch the map, and it was still, but when watching it from across the room it was blowing in the breeze.", "These sensations, while they may seem interesting now, were terrifying at the time, because I was afraid that eventually everything would appear as a melting, pulsating, blob of color, and that people's voices would sound garbled and unintelligible.  If this were to happen, and I felt that there was a very good chance that it would, I'd be reduced to a pretty helpless and confused person unable to communicate.  I began telling myself that if I could just talk with someone I could prevent these things from happening.  So, I got on the phone, and after dialing number after number I finally connected with Mike.  Mike is a stable, intelligent, caring sort of guy.  We talked.  I shared with him the whole scene, and he understood and was comforting.  As long as we talked, everything was okay.  He spent 2 whole hours with me on the phone. You really must have friends like this if you're going to try tripping on acid.", "Eventually, my other friends came home and we all talked.  They were considerate, and didn't play music or watch t.v. when I told them that I couldn't take it.  We all just talked and rode out my bad trip together.  If my friends hadn't been considerate, but had been assholes, I'd have flipped my lid.  I guess my best bit of advice is have good friends.", "I think I did LSD once or twice more after that cold night, but it was never good for me again.  I didn't have anymore bad trips, but LSD ceased to have the benefits it once had.  To this day, LSD is over for me, and I have no desire at all to ever do it again.  The good experiences I had with LSD, however, are still with me, and I find that is all I need.", "So there's this thing that came through my town called the Omegafest and my friend buys several bottles of the pure liquid that allegedly starts the national chain of illicit lysergic acid.", "This stuff is so strong and pure that I fill a by-then almost empty food-coloring bottle with tap water and swish and gulp... Blugh! I've never really tasted acid to such an immeasurable degree, and I soon discover that despite my self-proclaimed guru status I have never dosed like this before.", "So we're (my friend and I) winding back to our origin of consciousness and we're discussing trip stuff. After awhile I realize that my consciousness is completely delocalized and quantum reality is surging through my brain. I have to think really, really hard to figure out what room I am in and by midnight I have forgotten everything that I had done earlier that day.", "This is where it gets weird... I come to discover that me and my friend are of the same genetically evolved species, except I'm the active component and he's the passive component. He had mastered the trip from the past up the the present and I knew the trip from the present into the future. Anyways we finally succeed in smoking pot and I am suddenly absorbed in what I swore was post-terrestrial existence.", "Everything I saw moved in ray-traced slow motion and all light appeared to be pixellized. This is where the missing moment begins. We are walking in perfect circles in his apartment living room speaking back and forth to each other without thinking about it at all, utilizing the vehicle of our heightened consciousness to communicate. Then, I bump into a chair and it fucks with my orbit. I obliviously pick the chair up and heave it as if it was the oppressive force I've experienced my entire subjective existence... right through a gigantic sliding glass door.", "My friend looks at me astonished, but I assuage his anxiety by proclaiming 'Hey man! It doesn't matter anymore! We're creating everything we perceive with our minds and now you and I are going to infuse our thoughts and make the universe contract into the big stop! Finally! We're god now!'", "How incredibly naive. We proceeded to break a lot of other things in his home, spit on the walls, pour beer everywhere, unleash gigantic bags of tea into the air, and cover all of the walls with psychotic gibberish in crayon. Actually, I only broke the glass door with the chair and my friend did all of the other stuff while I lay in the bottom of his shower... water blasting, curled up naked in a fetal position sucking my thumb. A baby once again...", "My subjective cognitive reference point had completely vanished and I was thrown back into infinity... Simultaneously existing in a 3d shell with my mind expanded into the entirety of the fouth dimension. Mentally dead but physically alive. I was still waiting for us to somehow shed our old skins and enter 'thought-world' but I started coming down instead.", "I realized that I was not, in fact, existing in a place made by my thoughts so that I could unify all things into one, but that I had just tripped harder than I've ever tripped on LSD and that now I would have to pay for the shit I broke. Kinda bummed me out that I had tripped once again only to put more polish on the paradigm and not to cross myself over into a greater form, whatever that might have been.", "This was the first LSD experience I had. I was 18. What's kind of interesting is that it was the first real experience with any psychoactive drug I'd had (save for alcohol once when I was 12--different story). I was very straight in High School. I never went to parties, never smoked cigarettes or pot and never drank. I was in good physical condition from working out and running every day... Still, I always loved the culture that seemed to surround acid and wanted to get the inside scoop. An acid fiend I was friendly with gave me a tab which I kept in a little box under my bed which I finally opened one school Sunday. I gathered suggested materials (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, copy of Yellow Submarine) and set off for my friend's house.", "I was a little worried because of my lack of experience. None of the drug veterans could relate to me the acid experience to their own satisfaction, but still I was excited. I wanted to see pink clouds swirl around my feet and obscure the ground like a foot of snow and watch tree trunks turn into tornado funnels.", "Anyway, I went to my best friend's (a seasoned acid veteran at the time) and put the tab on my tongue as we sat in the wilderness next to his house listening to Mr. Bungle. I drew a little in my sketchbook. An hour passed and the lack of any effects made me worry that it was a dummy tab, or maybe that I was in such good physical condition that the dosage didn't affect me. Two hours passed and we headed back to his house, I guessed I got burned.", "As we ascended the stairway, I looked out the window at the green foliage across the cul-de-sac and felt an inexplicable urge to smile. The image was high-contrast and high-saturation, like the super-glossy cover of some pop album. 'Uhh, I definitely think this stuff is working', I said as I ambled into my friend's room and plopped down next to his bed and watched how the colors were altered and intensified as if under a tinted glass. ", "Basically it was really fun. At the time I felt bad for doing such a thing to my body but looking back I don't regret it. My friend drove me to a house for some reason where a family was gathered for Superbowl Sunday and I saw the sunset under the effects of LSD: Looking down on the landscape from the hill, horizontal strips of it appeared to be separate and closer than the others, as if the whole image was an illusion concocted inside a stereoscope. Later when I was peaking I saw clouds in the sky turn into trilobytes as Led Zeppelin played on a stereo. Though it was familiar, I perceived passages of music within it that I hadn't before. The comedown was bad but my parents never suspected anything and I had a friend help me through it.", "I am 27 years old and really started experimenting with drugs when I was about 23.  I am very successful in my career and am exceptionally open-minded and challenge my mind all the time.  I have never taken drugs excessively, but enjoy the experience and make the most of it!", "I enjoy transcendental meditation and challenge the boundaries of thought regularly without the use of drugs.", "I have enjoyed ecstasy at clubs as I have reveled in the energetic dance spurts, the open conversation where fellow humans drop their facades and barriers and we converse as openly as we would truly like to.  I have become so much closer to many people, as I have not been afraid to say how I really feel.  ", "I have taken acid several times, especially when I was 'starting out.'  We always did it at home with only 2 or 3 people with us.  Got videos, music, sweets, etc.  I always experienced the usual, i.e:  the plants, walls and things moving, extremely sensitive to music and colour.  My trips have always been happy and I felt as though I moved through an adventure land, each room offering different magical visuals and experiences.  Closing my eyes, I felt as though I went on 'trips' as a Kalahari bushman, fisherman, eskimo, etc, the music taking me further into my mystical journeys.  Watching videos is also a lot of fun, getting so engrossed in the films.  I found the phenomenon funny, as the title of the film sometimes made an impression prior to taking the drug and it would effect the way in which I viewed the movie, e.g. Eraser (I could never remember what was going on or what had just been said - as if it had been erased from my mind).", "I enjoyed eating sweets, as I would revel in the taste.  When eating chocolate, I could dissect the flavours and taste the eggs, cocoa, flour, etc. separately.  I had never really focused on these feelings, as in the group I was always distracted to play the next game or enter into the next adventure.  I did realise, however, that whilst we were all on the same drug, I did experience everything more intensely and my trip would last longer than everyone else's.", "We had also taken acid in nature and I truly enjoyed that experience.  It was raining and I was on a swing and I felt like a little fairy swinging in a world full of falling crystals.  The water with leaves was mesmerising and touching it was like entering into a whole new sensation.", "My friends, all guys, would find different things amusing.  They would get stuck in a rut - watch the same advert over and over, and find it hilarious.  They tended to click and joke about 'superficial' things, whereas my experiences seemed more in touch with the things around me and my experiences and senses.", "I actually enjoyed the effects of LSD and would sometimes lie on my bed with the lights off, whilst the others ran around the house laughing, and I would watch the light reflections, and just enjoy the pictures and colours when I closed my eyes.  I often said after a trip that I wished I could draw some of the patterns I saw.  These were purely patterns and things moved in a two dimensional manner with a motion which seemed to repeat itself, a flowing motion, but the objects remained in their true form.", "On my 27th birthday 2 weeks ago, I decided it had been ages since I had last done acid and thought it would be great to have a house party, invite a few friends and pop a trip.  This was to be one of the most conflicting experiences of my life, which still 'haunts' me and got me interested in reading more about the drug and reading other experiences.  I cannot say that it was a bad trip, however, I truly focused on what I could do with my mind whilst I was on this trip and took myself to places where I felt unmanagaeble, yet in full control. I say conflicting, as the rush of emotions was intense and I was not sure whether I liked it or not.  I loved it...and I have never been so terrified in my life!!", "My trip commenced at about 22h00 at my house.  I had about 12 friends over, who all popped a cap, and the plan was that we would party for a while and go to a club.  I was concerned about going out after taking acid and I decided not to, as I preferred staying in an environment that I felt at home in.", "As per usual, most of the people at the party were guys, my husband included.  My husband and I are both very intelligent and we stimulate each other mentally.  We also enjoy things like Reiki and have been for attunements, etc.  We click on many subjects and we are great mental partners.", "Shortly after taking the drug, I felt a very different feeling than ever before.  The effects of the drug were very strong and I found I was struggling to concentrate on anything.  I started experiencing a new sensation unlike before.", "My hands kept getting stuck to things.  The experience was like one of being hypnotised.  I had been hypnotised in a show once (a stage hypnotist show) and remember the feeling of him telling me to put my hand on the wall.  He told me I was stuck.  The sensation of not being able to take my hand off the wall even though I knew it was all in my mind was strange, as I truly could not, even though cognitively I knew I should be able to, and that I had allowed myself into this state.  I enjoyed the state of hypnotism and this was similar, even though I always knew in the back of my mind that I was always in control of how deep I would allow myself to get involved.", "The feeling as mentioned above was very similar.  Somehow, I started losing touch with the rest of the party and started focusing on what I was feeling.  I remember it so clearly.  The people became more and more distant, and they became almost non-existent.  I could hear them and see them and yet I felt as though I was getting more engrossed in where I was going and in my 'own little world' than ever before.  I was not feeling happy like before, but intrigued by this new sensation.  ", "I would put my hands on my hips and not be able to pull them off.  It would feel as though they were melting together.  This melting sensation never went away and whatever I touched I became attached to.  I still vaguely recall someone joking when I did not let go of them, that I was like a magnet!", "I somehow became further and further removed from reality.  When some people told me they were leaving, I could not understand why and I did not comprehend how they could still remember to go out as per the original plan, as I felt so far removed from reality that I could not remember that anything besides me in my little world existed.  I also felt myself progressing futher and further into this state and further away from reality.", "I began questioning in my mind how I was experiencing this drug, as opposed to the other people.  I recall walking into the TV room and everyone was laughing, I felt different.  The questions were more and more intense in my head and I started feeling as though the drug and I were playing some sort of game.  I started getting a little panicky, as I could not understand how others could remember reality and driving.  When I asked them to tell me what was going on in reality, i.e. the cold truth as to whether there were still people at the party, how many were left, what time it was, they could not understand why I was so persistent.  I had lost total touch with where I was and was so dissociated from everything that I felt more 'fucked' than everyone and started questioning the effects on me as oppossed to others and whether I was starting to feel the effects more than others.", "This is when things really started to happen for which I was totally unprepared.  My husband too had taken the same dose as I and yet I lost him totally on this.  I thank him for remaining calm.", "We decided at 03h30 to go to our bedroom, get under the covers, listen to music and enjoy our tripping.  I was experiencing the ultimate in visuals.  The frightening part, however, was the fact that my duvet felt like lead and it felt as though it was falling through me.  This sensation was strange, as when I thought about it, it would become intense and when I pretended it was feather light, it would feel as though it was lifting off me.", "I then started playing with the drug - mistake or not?  I had a glass bowl of sour jelly tots.  I started sucking on one and imagined it to be the most sour thing I had ever eaten.  My reaction was very physical, I salivated and my eyes watered and man, was it so sour.  I then sucked on another and focused on the sweet inside and disregarded the sour powder it was covered in - it would taste heavenly and so sweet.  I then imagined them chewy and so I went on focusing more and more on the typical mind over matter thing.  That was when things get scary.", "I focused on the bowl which was 'melted' to my hand, however, the objects maintained their dimensions.  I was speaking with my husband the whole time and told him to imagine that these jelly tots were cold and that they were all huddled at the bottom of the bowl.  I pictured them cold and they appeared to shrink and get close together and the bowl would be dark.", "I then told him to focus on the jelly tots in the glass bowl and imagine them all light, fluffy and floating to the top.  My visual sensation then changed entirely in dimension and appearance.  I was focusing on this when suddenly reality was lost entirely.  It was as though the jelly tots became like a lava lamp, floating up, but becoming liquid in appearance.  Whilst I was focusing on the jelly tots I was fine, but then I saw my entire hand melt into the bowl as if it were liquid and I had lost all sensation in my hand.  I panicked...then I realised that my entire body had 'disappeared' and I felt like a mind only.  This panic brought me back to reality quite quickly, or so I thought!", "I sat up, chucked the bowl on the floor and realised I was shaking like a leaf.  I then looked around me and, both frightened and amazed, I could not believe what I was seeing.  The colours had become so intense, and my previous visual of flowing patterns became more exaggerated.  I looked at my husband and without focusing on anything realised that I was in a different dimension than what I had previously experienced.  I looked at him and around him was a bubble of lights, the same patterns as before, yet more intricate with more colours, not flowing, but whizzing round in a three dimensional manner.  His skin seemed to illuminate patterns.  His hair strands were all different colours - it was beautiful!!  But then, I removed his skin with my eyes and he began to melt into the bed.  It was as though I was looking into my own little movie screen and could not see the reality beyond.", "I then tried to get back to the previous state I had been in visually and could not.  By this time it was 04h00 and my husband was beginning to come down.  The scary part was it felt as though my experience was just beginning.  I kept telling myself that it was all in my mind and that I was in control.  But then this riddle would start in my head, was I actually in control of the drug or was it in control of me?  It became this battle of cognitive processes of which I was not actively trying to think - they were just happening!", "I got out of bed.  Everything around me was liquid.  When I focused on reality, the walls would stop moving and the room looked normal and then it would seem as though this screen would come up again and block out the walls and the walls would melt into the gound and swallow up the pictures.", "I jumped up and the scary thing is I could not feel my body.  As I walked barefoot on the cold floor, I felt like I was falling through.  I asked my husband to hold me, I could not feel that.  I ran down the passage jumping with all my might on the ground.  Nothing, I was just a head.  My mind then shut out all pictures of reality, letting me melt them, turn things into cartoonish type things, remove the skin, see the muscles, then see the skeleton.  When I 'saw' my hand melt into thin air and not feel it at the same time, I worried as to whether I had dissociated myself from reality so much that I would not be able to come back.  I thought that maybe this new state of consciousness would not allow me to come back.  It felt as though the drug was playing a power game in my head.  The visuals were absolutely amazing.  ", "Eventually, realising that it was all in my head, I started feeling out of control.  I knew it was in my head and yet I could not get out of my head and experience anything real or tangible.  I felt as though I was going to die, but the worst part was that my mind was so active that I felt immortal in my head.  I could hear my husband speak to me, however, I could only see him in reality when I really focused on him.  I realised then that whatever I imagined is what I saw.  I was in total control of my mind and visuals and even audio.  This frightened me, as I started realising that I was in control of my bodily functions.  When I thought about feeling cold, I shivered intensely, when I wanted to be hot, I broke into a sweat.  This frightened me, as I felt that while I was in control I could look after myself, however, when I felt that I was losing control to the drug in this game in my head, I worried that it would force my body, blood flow, to lose synchronisation and kill me by stopping my heart.  If I could do it, then so could the drug, no?  I suddenly felt as if I had gone where I should not have.  I felt that my brain controlled everything about me, and that in this state I could hurt me by thinking about it.", "At 06h00 I could take it no more, this game of control in my head was too much and reality was too far away, I needed it so badly.  I then asked my husband to take me to the hospital - I just wanted to sleep and feel it was all a bad dream.", "In the car, it felt as though my foot fell through the floor and I was not even sure whether I was on the seat or not - I could not feel anything.  The drive to the hospital was beautiful and breathtaking, but the visuals were liquid and the objects did not even look like themselves at times.", "I kept telling myself that I was in control and that it was a drug.  I told myself I am intelligent, confident, etc., almost hoping that I was convincing myself that I could beat this drug in my head.  Closing my eyes offered no comfort, as this screen displayed the same visuals whether my eyes were open or closed.  I walked into the hospital and was fighting the threatening fear!!", "The nurses were pretty sympathetic, however, the doctor was patronising.  I told him I had taken acid and that I was hallucinating.  He asked me if I was hearing voices and seeing monsters.  I told him that I was stuck in my head and that I saw whatever I imagined, and that if he started mentioning monsters I am sure I would see them.  His physical mass kept changing in front of my eyes and I kept telling myself that there was a man in front of me.", "They took blood and put me on a drip and left me lie and work through it.  The hallucinations were becoming worse, like comic strips mocking me in my mind.  I eventually asked my husband to call someone after an hour as I was frightened - it felt more and more as though I would never return - or worse return, but never be normal again!", "I kept telling myself that I was stronger than this drug and that I was a fighter, however, it was getting the better of me.  I was so conscious of the blood in my body, etc.  ", "A new doctor came to see me and admitted me into the hospital.  They checked my pupils and they were a 4, whatever that means - no dilation I guess.  They tested my reflexes and asked me to push against their hands with my limbs, it felt as though I was melting into them.", "They injected me with a tranquilizer to subside the thought processes.  Those were probably the worst hours of my life.  They discharged me at 15h00.  I had to lie with my thoughts for those hours, wondering where reality was, hating this stupid game in my mind, pins and needles in my limbs.  It kept feeling as though I would never return to normal.", "I was frightened to sleep when I got home and feared going into the rooms again.  I still look at the objects that had so marvelled and frightened me and expect them to jump out at me at any moment.", "I read a note I had written to myself during that evening.  I had written, 'A party happened and I did not even know it was happening even though I was there, but I was really busy in the meanwhile!'", "Two weeks later I still feel anxious about the experience and have started reading extensively.  The psychosis is what scared me.  Living with the pictures of me melting away and only residing in my head.  It makes me fear death - the physical may disappear and yet the mind remains hidden from reality.  At the same time it is a comforting feeling that something carries on.", "I have been struggling to deal with it, as no one I have known has had similar experiences, and I know where it was that I overstepped the threshold.  My mind is beautiful, that is all I can tell you.  I met corners of my head that amazed me, however, a part of me is dark.  I am not frightened of that, but feel that I went somewhere I should have left.  It was more intense than any meditation, where I have met my guides, or hypnosis.", "Whether my experience is useful or not, I longed to speak about it to someone who may understand.  I crossed boundaries, which I was not equipped to handle.", "Yip, I guess that is why they call it a 'trip.'  The game I played in my head.  The fight for control and pushing the limits of my thoughts.  It was fun - would I do it again?  I am in two minds about it and I guess the answer would be no!  I feel lucky to have come back, however, I feel witness to supernatural things - I guess the answer is no because I am only in one mind!!", "Tripping outdoors is always the best, letting Mother Nature personally guide you. This is how it went one night last summer.", "Summer break was ending and my friends (Bill, Marcus and Jamal) were just getting back into Colorado from other states.  We had all simultaniously gotten into this drug thing but we had never tripped together.  There was nothing to do on campus this Friday night, but I had 8 hits of acid on me.  I ran into my friends outside our dorm and told them my plan.  To make a night of it we drove Bill's Cougar up towards Rocky Mountain National park at about midnight.  About half an hour after dosing we stopped in a small mountain town along the way to walk around and look at things, including a large dinosaur (triceratops) skeleton in a shop window that we could not stop laughing at.  After meeting this creature and realizing we weren't sober any longer we decided to head on up into the mountains.", "Bill's car stereo is one of the best I have ever heard.  When it's turned up and the windows rolled down you can hear it from literally miles away, we were fortunate to have it with us that night.  As we were listening to DJ Dan while acending deeper into the forest and farther from the rest of the world we decided to pull over and explore.  The moon was full, and the entire forest was ours, it might as well have been some beautiful new green planet we were on.  We found ourselves in a little valley with a stream in the middle and forrested mountains on two sides, with the sky clear and every star shining.  Marcus and I decided to take a walk down to the stream while Bill and Jamal broke some new glowsticks and danced in the middle of the road.  After several hours (or minutes?  you can never tell on this drug) I was thinking that there couldn't be another human within 20 miles of where we were.  Right as I converted this thought into words, a car drove by, saw the glowsticks, hit the brakes and turned around and stopped.  ", "Right as we were about to panic (we were in no condition to deal with other people at this point) two guys stumbled out of the car with two cartons of orange juice!  I can't remember thier story but they were tripping also, driving across the state.  They left us a carton of OJ and we smoked them up, and they went on their way. Analyzing the encounter, they seemed to be just a couple of farmer's kids out having fun like we were.  They came from such a different background compared to four little candy ravers, and we never would have met them, least make friends with them if it weren't for the drugs bringing us together.  Not long after they left we decided to continue up further into the mountains.", "Several miles down the road we found the spot:  to this day I think of this little area as my spiritual home.  When I die I am sure this is where my spirit will go immediately.  It's simply a small parking lot on the top of a small mountain pass with overlooks on either side.  On the left there is the remainder of a mountain, on the right a small rocky hill that the road winds around.  One can see the lights of Estes Park (50 or so miles away) and possibly further from the overlook, thousands of feet higher than the valleys below.  We were two hours into our trip now, and everything was beautiful, too much so for words to begin to describe.  Huge green pine trees were all around us, concealing us from the world and the world from us.  I had purchased Paul Oakenfold's 'Tranceport' that day and had not listened to it yet.  We put that CD in the stereo and listened as the bass rumbled through the forest, through the valleys so far below and up past the high mountaintops.  I credit that music for creating the feelings felt that night.  We stayed in that spot and danced the night away.  The trees seemed to dance to it also.  At one point the four of us took a walk down the road to look down into the world.  Bill and I were leading with Marcus and Jamal trailing and having a wierd debate about TV commercials or something.  There was a tree laying on its side that apperently gave Bill weird vibe, so he approached it and asked no one in particular 'Are these trees?  I don't think so...'.  On closer inspection they were indeed trees.  All of us had the same perception problems and had a blast sorting things out, but not before engaging in an argument with the downed log.", "Back at the car Bill and I decided we needed a campfire.  We had planned ahead and brought lighters, wood and newspaper to light, so we opened the trunk to get the materials.  'Wait, what were we doing again?' 'I forgot...I know we opened the trunk for a reason...hmm'.  Quickly forgetting everything, we danced for who knows how long before Marcus yelled 'Hows that fire comming along?' 'OH YEAH!  A fire!!'.  After forgetting what we were doing several more times the concensus between the four of us was that we were not of mental capacity to start and maintain a fire, and the idea was dropped.  In hindsight, we probably would have burned down the forest so its better that way.", "I can't tell you the details of several hours where all memories are kida fuzzy, all I can remember is a feeling.  A feeling of joy, contentness.  More so than MDMA can ever give you.  My three best friends in the world, a different world perhaps, and I were all dumb as animals, trying to get a grasp on reality, but there was no hurry in getting to wherever we were going.  We had all night, and memories of school and the campus were so incredably distant as to be a dream.  It was amazing how much like a dream the past 18 years of my life were.  Reality wasn't reality at all, and I was finally awakened from it, into a far better place where reality is constantly changing at the touch of a thought.", "As the sun began to rise we decided to climb the rocky cliff near the car.  The car!  It must have been 200 yards away  and twice as far below us but we could hear Tranceport as clear as ever.  I remember Bill and Marcus climbed up farther than Jamal and I, and watching thier silouhettes dancing against the brightening sky.  Rock climbing was dificult, and here we were conquoring the cliff, and proving it by DANCING on it!  We felt as if we had just climbed Everest and were on top of the world.  And the view from the top...  We were surrounded by miles of wilderness all around us and we could look down on it all and command it.  As supeior beings we watched the sun slowly rise and light the valleys below, feeling a bit like Zeus must have on top of Mount Olympus.  Unfortunately the drugs in our systems were waning, and Jamal and I started the long descent back to the car.  As we got to the bottom a park ranger's car was pulling up (oh no!  We were still too cracked out to string two words togeter in a fashon as to not scare a person not on this drug).  Talking to the ranger was fun as it turned out.  It felt like my mind was so expanded I could understand anything in an instant, while his was compressed and slow.  He was just checking to see if we were OK as it turned out, and gave off a good vibe.  Nonetheless, it was almost 8 am!! and we took it as a sign it was time to head home.  ", "At the time none of us realized what had trancepired [sic] that night, I hope I conveyed it into words suitably.  It was the perfect trip.  We did everything:  traveled to new worlds, met mother nature personally, talked to her trees and rocks and mountains.  Practiced telepathy.  We met new people experiencing the same things as we were.  We danced.  We discovered new ways of thinking.  We bonded.  No matter what happens many years from now, The four of us will always have that night to look back upon.  Everything was perfectly synchronized.  We got into the mountains righ as we were beggining to peak.  We had just enough lsd in us to see the sunrise and try our hand at being immortal.  When it was time to call it quits and go home God sent that park ranger out to us.  Every time I listen to Tranceport I remember the feelings of this night, although they get fainter and fainter every time.  Still, I look back on it as the best night of my life.  If i were to die tommorow it would be OK because I was there, experiencing it, having more fun than anyone should be allowed to have, and knowing that only a fraction of a percent of all life on Earth has discovered what joy is.  What it feels like to awaken from the dream that was reality.  Thank you Mother Nature and Paul Oakenfold.", "I just read some bad trip stories, and all I can say is holy shit...I think I definitely would have died. The first time I tripped, on two yellow geltabs, I thought I was going to go insane. But as one unfortunate person put it, 'There will always be someone who has done more than you. ' Indeed, my friend said that he tripped so hard once he had to go up to trees and touch them to see if they were real. That made me feel better. ", "Anyways, reading about those bad trips made me feel a li'l sad, so I decided to contribute a happy trip story.", "That very same friend and I tripped on New Year's Eve, 1999. My friend, Neo, loves to trip, the harder the better. I, on the other hand, am definitely a roller. I would have loved to roll that night, but let me tell you that when you're dead ass broke and you're craving a roll real bad, a mind bending $5 trip hits the spot real good. We dropped around 11:00pm and smoked up a little with my sister and my other friend Goku. It seemed like a long time had gone by, and I had actually forgotten that we had dropped already when I started feeling that weird wirey acid feeling. The main thing was Goku's watch. Every time he moved it, the street light would glint off of it, except instead of it being a white glint, it was bright red. Neo and Goku were talking, and Goku flicked away his cigarette, which left a long orange trail behind it. Neo then asked if I was feeling it, which got an emphatic yes.", "By the time midnight struck, Neo and I were both tripping balls, and it really sucked having to go in and hug my family. We went outside shortly thereafter, and everything was moving. I knew it was cold outside, but I had taken my shoes off and I couldn't feel my feet. Everything was moving really fast, and the grass had a weird pattern on it, like brain coral. Neo came out and we stood together, looking at the clouds. They seemed to be wanting to spell something, but never quite got there. Then I looked at Neo, and he looked ancient. He gave me a hug, and it felt like our bodies were a gummy-bear consistency. Goku joined us, and we went to the side of the house, out of sight of my family. The shadows on the wall from the plants were moving all over the place, and the cars looked like they were breathing. I laughed and asked my car if I treated it good, and it actually nodded at me! That was a little scary, but no big deal.", "Then we went over to Goku's to dance with glowsticks, and that's where the fun really began. Goku wasn't tripping, but he was high and drunk, and is an incredible dancer. He is the one who taught me to dance, and calls me his prodigy. Anyway, when Goku would dance, it looked like he was constructing a pattern around him, like the Epcot ball. Other times the trails formed weird celtic knots that we couldn't quite figure out. Most of the time it looked like he had four arms, and that his hands were eagle's claws holding blue and yellow medallions. It got crazier, too. Sometimes it looked like the trails were going through his body, shooting out his chest and shit. He would do this weird trick where he would move the glowsticks around my face, and it felt like he was picking my head off my neck, twisting it around and putting it back. His body looked like it was fragmenting into two or four pieces, the way it would look in a shattered mirror. And at one point, when he was really dancing in my face, he was moving his hands back and forth in front of my eyes, and I could see his face THROUGH HIS HANDS!! His hands were translucent or something, and I could see his face clearly, like something you would see in a weird music video. Goku has done a good share of intense shit, but even he had to admit that was crazy. My dancing was good too, but I couldn't really get into it, and I kept dropping the glowsticks. The comforter on the bed had a floral pattern, though, and when the glowstick would fall there, it looked like the liquid inside was combining with the flowers, and the flowers were going into the glowstick.", "All in all, it was fun, since I can handle acid now. But what I hate most about geltabs is the inability to sleep afterwards. I never had that problem with the wimpy paper hits. Many hours later I began to feel sore, especially in the back and feet. I know geltabs are supposed to spare you this discomfort, but who knows. ", "Neo and I got home (after a very intense drive, let me tell you) at around 5:30am. I thought the trip was going away, but I was wrong. My feet looked white and the joints looked purple, and they looked like the feet of a corpse. It didn't bother me, but they did hurt, and were about as cold as a corpse's feet too. I kept saying I thought I had frostbite (in Miami? yea right!). My room looked really pretty. It had a soft pinkish glow, and everything seemed really colorful and interesting. I never realized what a good tripping room I had, even though a friend told me so a long time ago. Well, i got in bed, and hard as I might try, I could NOT sleep. When I closed my eyes, I kept seeing a weird pattern of shapes that looked like letters, but not quite. Maybe they were alien letters. Anyway, they were all over everything, as though a screen of them had been draped over my eyes, and they were turning every color of the rainbow. I had been seeing them since the beginning of the trip, and were getting annoying. After miserably watching the sun come up, I fell asleep for a few hours, and had all sorts of acid dreams, which looked like splatters of paint being shot this way and that. I was completely fried and exhausted the next day. At least I didn't feel like rolling anymore, though!", "All I can say about acid is that it's fun if you can handle it. It should definitely be done with someone who has a lot of experience with it, as this makes you feel safe. I would also definitely recommend not to half-ass it, because if you do, you will feel uncomfortable and not have any visuals. Let's face it: LSD is not a physically pleasant feeling. What's great about it is the mind blowing shit you will see. I have never hallucinated off it before, but the amount of colors on everything is amazing. Also, have other alternative things planned. Dancing with glowsticks is amazing, but since acid is not rolling, you will get tired of it relatively soon. Have good movies ready, particularly Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. You will laugh until your stomach hurts. The Matrix is also good. Nothing sad, or you will completely ruin your trip. I saw Deep Impact tripping because I thought it would be cool; big mistake. I came home wanting to be with my family, and I was totally depressed. Also, I know I am probably an exception, but I tend to get starving towards the end of my trip, so have good food ready. And plenty to drink. Mainly, have things to keep you occupied and having fun, because if you let your mind wander while on that shit, you could get in mad trouble. Peace out.", "I've been tripping for about six years now, on and off. When I first started using LSD, I got really into it. I dropped a lot for about two years. I've eaten tons of blotter. (Tim Leary and Purple Jesus Christ were always the best). I've had pure LSD-25, sugar cubes, gel tabs, etc. Then for 3 years I didn't touch it. Depression is a bitch.", "Then I was at a huge party and two of my friends shroomed, and another friend and I got acid. I only ate one hit cause I knew I would have to drive later that night (party started at noon). That night I became completely digital. It was my first trip that visuals didn't matter, cause of the intense body trip. Anyway, it was good and decided that it would be my last trip.", "Well about a year has passed since then, and in the last few months, I tripped about five times. As for tolerance, the most acid I've dropped in recent months is 3 hits at once of 'cherry bomb.'", "Then I unexpectedly ran into a kid that had white blotter acid while smoking with some friends. My girlfriend (Ash) and I both ate one hit. ", "We chilled, smoked, and drank a few beers over a card game and the new 311 CD. A good time it was. Then people wanted to go out. So, Ash and I decided to take cover before the acid peaked. We drove back to the city to chill with our smoke friends. Throughout all this, I was tripping, but in control.", "Soon it came time to take ash home. The trip was good , but we both agreed it was strange, not like normal acid. It was definitely nothing else than LSD though. We decided to watch a movie. What better movie to watch than 'The Wall.' I love that movie. Well... not anymore. I thought that I was the main character suffering from insanity.", "Then, after the movie we were just laying down listening to music. Then my girlfriend was saying things like,' Why do you have to have such a strong spirit, why can't you be weak so you do what I want.' (she wanted to have sex) Then she was kissing my neck, and I told her to stop. I said it felt like she was suffocating me, so she laughed and continued. At this point, I was scared. I had to get away. When I was leaving, she started crying for no reason at all. She told me it was cause of the acid and she would be fine for the rest of her trip. So I went home. When I was going to sleep (never good to do while tripping) all kinds of shit was going through my head.", "When I woke up in the morning, all my crazy thoughts were still there. Not like back in the day, where you wake up, and everything is normal again (besides after effects). I still thought my girlfriend was Satan. I had a job interview to go to, and I saw my first love for the first time in five years. Totally unexpected. (I think the reason she broke up with me was drugs). After I finished my interview, I had to see Ash, but I was scared. I had to ask her whether she was really Satan or not. So then I saw her and she put my head back on straight. It was so hard to come out of that trip. No more LSD for me.", "Acid is fun, but don't overdo it. One day you may not be able to separate reality from drugs. I never thought this would be me either!", " I was 17 at the time and I remember getting back from school and calling up one of my boys and asking what was up for the night.  It was a friday. He told me that he could hook up some acid, so I said let's try it. So me and my twin brother went to his canton 20 minutes later and he already hooked up 10 tabs for 25 bones, so we gave him our share and we all took 3 tabs each. He saved 1 for the next day.", "I drank a big cup of orange juice to help kick in the effects (I don't know if that really works) and waited. Twenty-five minutes went by and I didn't feel a thing. I thought we got ripped off and my homie says, 'He said this shit was potent.' And I said, 'Man, we took 3 doses and I ain't feeling shit.' Five minutes went by and I realized how wrong I was. This shit had me on a 14 hour trip. In the peak I saw everything in a glittery glow and everything I looked at began to melt. My bro and T said they felt it too. They said they saw tracers and my brother said that he felt like he was melting. It was insane.", "Anyway, I was listening to my walkman and I go outside of my homie's pad. It was already getting dark, but then I started to notice that everything began to move with the rhythm of the music (I was listening to some Jimi Hendrix). It was so intense how the timing was just exact, it would slow down then pick up pace. The sounds I heard in the music resembled life, it was like reality was represented by the music and I could feel myself floating. I let my eyes go out of focus and then I saw hundreds of little pictures of me right in front of my eyes, like I was staring at myself from behind while I was looking into a mirror. I looked to the sky and I saw the stars forming geometric shapes. I have never had an LSD trip like this before, this was something else.", "I saw a cat calling for me and I looked into its eyes and realized that I began to communicate with it. I really understood what it wanted. I think it was a stray cat and it seemed to be lonely. I could see what it was thinking, and it undersood how I felt. Let me tell you, I'm not a cat person, but I started to pet it and it felt grateful for my company. All of a sudden it sounded like it was whispering words to me. Though I couldn't understand what it was saying, I felt it was speaking truths. My bro and T were just sittin' there on the couch just tripping, laughing at everything, man. But I saw this and it seemed as though I knew why it was like this and I couldn't explain it. I could still hear the cat then I said, 'Farewell, little guy and good luck.' I went back into the room and tried to tell these guys what was happening, but they were laughing too much, so I couldn't blame them.", "I sat on the couch and listened to my walkman. I felt like I was in the music. I couldn't see myself anymore, I could just hear the music all around me. Then I closed my eyes and opened them to what seemed to be a universe and all this time I could hear music playing in the backround. I lost track of time and it seemed like an eternity, but when I closed my eyes and opened them again, I was in my neighborhood walking and it was daytime. This all on the kraziest 14 hour acid trip of my life. I tell you, this really was something else. Almost like a dream in reality.", "It was about the 3rd week of October, 1998, just before the local campground was about to close. My parents had a camper at this park that they kept there all year round, as did a couple of my friends' parents. Me and 5 of my friends decided to do acid that day. They started, dropping 2 hits each at noon. I had to bring my girlfriend at the time home from work at 3:30, so I decided to wait until later that night to take my 2 hits. I left my girlfriend's around 10 pm and headed to the campground. From what my friends told me, they had had a very intense trip, swimming, puking, laughing, hallucinating, and pretty much the normal trip. ", "By the time I arrived they were coming down. We came to the conclusion that we should all do 2 more together, since I had just gotten there. My friend J. decided that he'd have to take 4 becuase he had taken two earlier in the day and it wouldn't affect him if he only took 2, and the others all took between 3 and 4 more. After an hour or so we started to trip. J. decided that he needed to go get some OJ. He took off running for a store that was about 2 miles away and from what he said he didn't stop until he got there. ", "By the time he got back I was tripping hard. Speech was slurred and incomprehensible and I was getting pretty scared. Nothing (any spoken word) was making any sense. I was starting to get very panicked and freaked out. I kept asking my friend D., 'what the fuck is going on???' and he'd answer ' I dont' know,' like that was going to make me feel better. We decided to go for a walk since we were about the only ones in the park. You have to remember that this is around midnight and pitch black in the middle of the woods. ", "Just as we were about to leave, one of our friends came back totally panicking...saying that she was in the bathroom shower when she heard something growl at her. We decided to go for a walk to find whatever growled at her. As we started to enter the woods it got blacker and blacker until we could see absolutely nothing, not even the sky becuase the brush and trees were so thick. We really started to get scared that we were lost when we were running into trees and shit. We were all starting to panic and we were holding on to each other to try to find our way out of the woods...when we found the lake that was only about 100 feet from our camper. I don't remember who had the idea to go swimming, but I was just so glad to know where I was that I forgot all about being scared. I decided that yeah, a swim might feel good, but you have to remember it was October in the Atlantic Ocean...and you don't realize how cold it is because you are so hot from the acid. Let me tell you one thing that you never want to do is swim in frigid water on acid. After I finally got in and got used to the cold, going under was something else. I got totally lost, no sense of direction whatsoever and it was just fucked up. I was practically crying when we got out and back to the camper. All my clothes were wet, I was fucked up, didn't know how long this was going to last and by then, it was 6am. I had to go pick up my girl in 2 hours to bring her to work...and I was tripping hard. Needless to say, I was in no shape and the trip freaked me out so much I haven't touched acid since.", "Set: VERY tired from the <5 hours of sleep I got the night before, but in a good mood generally.", "Setting: A small rave at a bowling alley (my first rave).", "We entered the rave at the very start, around 11:00pm.  All of my friends were going to be rolling, but I'd been tired of it lately and hoped that I could find something a bit more interesting somewhere at the rave.  My hopes were fulfilled.  I told the guy I wanted 3 hits, and he asked me to buy at least 20, but I didn't have the money.  He told me 3 would be fine, so I tore what appeared to be 3 hits off of what I thought was a 10 strip (it was unmarked) and took it.  About 15 mintues later, I realized that he had wanted me to buy 20, and the 10 strip looked a bit wide, and...you get the picture.", "All times except start are estimated, because I was really not paying that much attention.", "01:30am - Definitely going to be an interesting night.... I don't sweat that much normally.  The floor was breathing and fractals were appearing in the wood.  Time slowed extremely, was actually wishing there were lights on in the room so I could see my visuals better. :-)", "02:45am - Sat down for a while.  As usual, my friends who were rolling were bitching about the music or something and blaming it for 'killing their roll.'  Perhaps the fact that ecstasy only peaks at around 3 hours or their negative attitude is what actually killed their roll, I'd say.  My arm was pulsating and there were little black worms crawling all over it into my skin.  This made me happy, because I'd been wanting to get a larger dose of acid at some point.", "03:00am - Went to bathroom.  Mental note:  Don't go in that bathroom again while tripping.  Sinks overflowing, somebody shit on the floor in the stall, puke in water-filled sinks overflowing.  Didn't especially bother me, but the fact that it didn't bothered me more, because it normally would have.  ", "03:30am - Like I said, this was my first rave.  When I first arrived, I remember that the first thing I noticed was that nothing made a damn bit of sense.  It was completely silly to an extreme I had never seen before.  Suddenly though, I looked around, and it made absolute sense.  Not that any group of people there fit together, it was just that the whole thing made sense.  It wasn't about 'PLUR' like everyone says.  There were many people there being mean or rude, and many being very nice.  There were the same ratio of nice people to jackasses that there is everywhere else I go.  The way it made sense was the same way a crowd of people walking down the street makes sense.  It was just another thing people do.  As with many acid headed thoughts, it is impossible to describe in English.  One thing I distinctly remember was laughing my ass off at the thought of massive groups of people being incredibly impressed by somebody swinging around glowsticks on a string.", "04:00am - Began watching the DJ.  I saw the passion he put into his music and realized one of the things I have been missing in my life for a long time.  Passion for what I do.  Vowed to change this, and have been so far.  At this point, glowsticks were leaving tracers that consisted of the color of the glowstick and bright neon purple writing in some asian language.  ", "04:15am - Could feel the bass with every single hair on my body, and felt electrified by it.  Dripping with sweat as well, even though I was just standing there.  I had several important realizations about my life that I won't really discuss here....", "04:30am - Danced a while.  The floor seemed to be covered with water or something slippery that was keeping me from dancing properly.  Sat down and watched the lights, which immediately began burning, with long colored flames rising into the air.  Greeted a friendly police officer as he walked by.  Absolutely no paranoia.", "05:00am - Watched the DJ some more, and felt my fingers melting together.  Hmm....  Wow, the guy who sold me the acid was getting the next record for the DJ.  What a small world. :-)", "06:00am - Just spent the last hour watching some friends dance with lights. ", "06:30am - #1 way to fuck with someone who took lots of acid:  Turn on all of the lights in the building suddenly, after it has been dark for the past 7.5 hours.  Wow.  Time to leave, so we went outside.  That was when I truly realized how much acid I had taken.  The sun had risen and everything was a beautiful ultra intense pastel color.  The clouds were rippling and shooting across the sky at extremely high speeds.  I was cold, so naturally the trees became covered with frost and icicles.  The condensation on the windows of the car turned to frost, too (it didn't, I verified it with my friends), and slowly melted as I warmed up.  On the drive home, houses in the distance were pulsating and sinking into the ground, and a radio tower duplicated itself about 99 times, filling the horizon with copies.  Thought a lot about my life on that ride, until about 10 minutes from home when I thought a lot about peeing. :-) Felt, smelled, tasted, and saw a smell at the same time.", "08:00am - Back to the dorms, time to sleep.  I can sleep on basically any amount of anything if I feel like it, and since I had only slept about 5 hours the night before I definitely felt like it.  Still patterning on walls, and hearing and seeing techno with my eyes closed.", "Slept till 1:00, and woke up feeling EXTREMELY happy about where my life is headed.", "I had a trip from hell experience. I was driving up to Milwaukee to see Jerry Garcia over thanksgiving break. Getting there about 5 hours early me and my friend ran into someone in a Van selling jewlery, chains and LSD (GO FIGURE!). I bought four and split them with my friend. We then headed over to the Milwaukee Museam of Art. After going through there for a few hours with great enjoyment we left to walk back to the bradly Center. The building that housed the art was across the expressway and you had to walk over the overpass and through a parking garage. ", "I was starting to really peak and we ended up getting lost somewhere in leaving the garage and ended up in a construction site. After working our way through that we got hopelessly lost. Finally after getting back near the Bradly center we stoped into a cafe to get something to eat (don't ask me what made me think I wanted to eat) I ordered some screwed up combo like onion rings soup and coffee. This old grouchy lady was the watress and one of two employees. The place was filled with deadheads. I was dressed fairly conservativly in Jeans and a sweater. All of them were really messed up. She constantly bitched about how hard her job was and just in general was rude to everyone.. She looked at me and said 'You are the only normal one in here' at that point I grimaced and burst out in uncontrolable smiles and laughter. She then said 'I don't know whats going on in here, your crazy too.' ", "I tried to pull my self together and gave my food to a hippie girl who had nothing to eat and was going in some caravan to California. I walked over to the Bradly center and was looking for the entrance, we were waiting up against the wall when two people right up in front of us I guess asked someone for doses, then three guys dressed as dead heads tied thier hands together with that plastic psudohandcuff ties and said , Milwaukee police, your under arrest, operation so and so etc.. this is where the trip went increasingly down hill. ", "After getting into the concert Still shook up and with my asthma giving me problems from being out in the cold so long I listened to I think the first four songs. Then I was overcome with depression and had to walk out.. I sat on the interior stairs of the center and cryed, telling my friend what a looser I thought I was, and how my life was worthless. Then I thought I was going to quit breathing, I wanted to call the paramedics and go to the hospital, but my friend talked me out of it, knowing what a mess that would be.. Finally after about an hour of thinking about everything that was bad and depressing to think about I pulled myself together. Some deadhead was so fucked up he fell down the stairs on top of me and by that time the concert was over. ", "I then went out to my car, did more mental acrobatics and drove home. I stoped at dennys after getting back to illinois and order more soup, god knows why?... After attempting to eat some and drink a little coffee I looked down at my soup, the carots looked like 'Steal Your Face' logos floating in beef broth... Very Strange... .I really have nothing more to say except that It was a trip to hell... However I did learn alot from it so I guess the pain wasn't completly worthless...", "My intention was to return to that rather frightening but nonetheless undeniably intriguing place where I had been on my last trip... yes, that bizarre 'brain wrapped around the universe' mode. This time I was equipped with a greater degree of understanding of the place, due in part to conversations I had had, and in part to my own realizations in integrating the details of the last trip.", "Only 2 hits of LSD this time... but it was quite enough. Again, the start time was late at night. I lie in bed. My brain and body thought that they were preparing for a night's sound sleep... heh heh, little did they know. Shortly, I began to stretch out in my bed, much as a dragon would awaken at the scent of battle. I felt the wind. Not the physical wind in the atmosphere, but the psychic wind that permeates all things (of which more later).....it swept through me, awakening with a tingle the dormant energy within me. I began to writhe in its glorious unearthly currents. The visuals emerged, separating out from their usual role as scaffolding in the structure of reality, and exposing themselves for my manipulation. They were part of ME. It wasn't long before I was again the conductor of an alien orchestra... the orchestra of my brain. I literally swept the LSD visuals into their structure as the representation of my brain... or else they assembled themselves.", "My first reaction was a sense of horror -- because I had forgotten the hellish feeling of Metaphysical Emptiness I had associated with this before.. the feeling (which I tried to describe in another report) that All is an empty illusion, and the only truly existing thing was just a brain/thought process that happened to be in a particular configuration in the pre-determined cycle. Instead of seeing the world, I saw the underlying reality behind the world, namely, the amorphous tissue behind the retina -- a total deconstruction of reality into the ugly, raw input. I was a mere detail, a mere surface expression of this inevitable program. But this time it made some sense that it hadn't really made before-- I knew I didn't have to get locked into a one-dimensional thought process (in which you can only do two things... go toward the light or away from it).", "Instead of 'me' being trapped inside heavy folds of brain tissue, my brain was laid out before me like the keys of a vast piano. My room was my brain. And my body was also my brain. Through the cells in my body I could feel the thoughts in my head and orchestrate the vision 'in my room', because the room was also in my head. I could also see my thoughts in the room, as if they were located in various places in my brain. ", "For the next few hours I explored my brain as if it were physical territory. I thought.... my God, it is so dirty in here. How could I even see correctly with all this gunk here? It occurred to me that cleaning it out would clear up my perception of reality.", "There are places in the brain that correspond to the various emotions. Love and hope and joy are up above... I reached upward with my mind and instantly, I was a fountain of light, bursting with joy in all colors, existing as pure, light consciousness. Heaven! But it was very brief.", "Pleasure, enthusiasm, aggression... are various places along the forward equator -- responses that propel us forward. To the side, humor, disgust. I did see some pretty disgusting things... in fact I had my first real taste hallucinations -- I tasted bitter rue! It was in a corner of the mind along with hair (sticky matted stuff like you find in drains and sinks), bubbly purplish snot, and some octopus tentacles. Yuck! But I laughed, because it was SO bad it was funny. I quickly got out of that one by swallowing it and 'recursing' up, up and away.", "More places in the brain -- behind is fear, below is despair. I was overcome with fear when I 'went' to that spot, for a moment I was crouched in the corner in terror. But realizing that it was a place that I had gone, just like the love/joy place, made me realize that getting out of fear is simple -- just move up!", "When we refer to thoughts and feelings, we like to use physical terms for them... 'sinking feeling', 'really reaching', 'deep thoughts', 'preying on the mind', 'a flash of insight', 'feeling tense'... I know why now... the unconscious mind knows full well what muscular tensions and motions correspond to various kinds of thoughts and emotions, and so 'figurative' language developed in a way that represents an accurate portrayal of these muscle motions. One particularly funny moment was the occurrence of dawn. Not just any dawn (in fact it was 3 am), but the Archetypal Dawning Moment, the dawn of a new age, I had finally 'awakened', something had 'dawned' on me. I felt that each awakening was a reconstruction of self-aware consciousness, a miniature echo of creation.", "In the brain, there are various closets and broom cupboards and unswept corners and attics. One can get into quite a cleaning frenzy, opening up old trunks and so on. Typically what I found was cliches and habits and instinctual behavior. All the ingredients of personality. I found that 'reaching' physically and 'reaching' in the mind are the same. All the time on acid I find myself reaching with my right arm for things, especially my glasses, whenever I want to reassert my intellectual hold on the situation. Now I see why! That's my left brain 'reaching' into the right brain and rummaging around -- that's my way of visualizing the process of connecting unconscious symbols with conscious intellectual ideas. I started to realize what dreaming is... literally, housekeeping. All of that stuff there in the corners exists in symbolic form.", "The archetypes are back there. Those symbols have not just been collecting dust all this time, either. I have been associating things to them constantly all my life, actually, probably eons beyond my present life. Snakes, for example. I saw them there, in a corner. The archetypal reptile. But this time, I made a connection to these snakes that brought them out of the closet of the unconscious mind and into consciousness. These snakes were kundalini energy, the Serpent Power. And what was the serpent power? It was the control of brain muscle. Here I had been storing all this occult symbolism for centuries, and just now I was making the connection between all that occult symbolism and an internally perceivable mind-state. These connections were thrilling to the mind... the mind which keeps everything around, knowing that one day, connections can be made between everything.", "That is what I felt the last time, but didn't understand. I saw or felt, as I was turning my body, shoelaces (karmic threads) being vacuumed up and disappearing. A sense of recursive levels of a deeply nested function all finally collapsing and producing a result. These recursive levels went back for eons. I realized what karma is -- unconnected bits and pieces that need to be connected. The mind is on a continual quest for knowledge (spiritual growth), to make connections between ideas. That quest is necessarily repetitive, trial and error. A single experience of deep connection with the spirit might wrap up years and years of karma. Certainly the awakening of kundalini and the understanding of powers of the body hitherto unknown had this effect. Certainly the penetration of the light of consciousness, with its scientific training, into the depth of the unconscious, enabled the unconscious to make connections it couldn't make all by itself. And likewise, I the conscious mind made some connections that I couldn't make all by myself. These connections are visualizable as threads in the cosmic fabric... the ego and the id are relentless knitters, tying this fabric into a sensible reality. The mind is literally obsessed with reality and truth... obsessed with a need to know. So obsessed that it is willing to risk insanity or death to discover its true nature. Self-awareness is the process of connecting inner states to outer states, where those outer states are also a part of oneself.", "I become strangely 'inverted'... outer and inner reality were somehow reversed. I could 'see' my brain 'out there' (even though it looks like ordinary reality for the most part, I 'knew better'), and it was kind of hard to make sense of ordinary tactal input. I think there was something weird about left/right being reversed that confused me. I was lost inside the brain and didn't know where the eyeholes were. I was locked into perceiving oneself as a brain and I couldn't figure out how to turn myself back 'outside-out'. I spent many minutes trying to figure out how my cat was able to exist inside my brain there with me. I thought it was because she was actually projecting herself into my thoughts. I also was a bit concerned that I would have cat hairs in my brain.", "I could hear some slooshing sounds (brain gloop sloshing around) and felt nauseous when I stretched my brain a lot. Also, it was a sore afterwords for a day or so, so I really do think I was using those muscles.", "If this sounds rather frightening, it is! At first I felt a great sense of power...... ah, I can direct everything from here! One quickly realizes that this is more of a responsibility than a power. I thought: I'm not qualified for this! Allowing the unconscious to become conscious might not be a good idea... this is like promoting someone with no experience (the ego) to a job they aren't qualified for... but which for the Id is old hat... routine, even dull.", "The biggest danger is the panic reaction. Don't Panic! The unconscious is still operating, so just letting go of the ego is the answer here. I had the idea (the same fallacious idea I had the first time) that the only way to recover normal reality was to retrace my steps... this is wrong. Normal reality is a natural state of affairs... simply allowing normal reality to return, having 'faith' that everything is O.K., and not worrying about it, is necessary here. Going toward the light does work. Light is input from out there, and restores ones orientation to the world outside.", "Again I went back to the deep loop in which my thought cycles through God, free will, time.... although this time I had some idea what I was after. I was testing the limits of my model of reality. This is where it hurts. This is where my model of reality is really strained. It has some gaps in it, and the gaps are connected with God, free will, , and time. I write in there, because there is something nameless in that list of four things that keeps recurring in my thoughts as a sub-linguistic concept. Because I haven't named it, I can't really even consciously understand what I am representing by it. It may have something to do with 'soul' or 'psyche'. I learned a quite a bit this time (I can talk about it in another message)... I discovered that a lot of what I associate with the word 'God' is part of me (a 'higher self' or the id, or something). I'll write up some of my other insights in another message.", "After giving in and trusting the natural functioning of the body, I regained some sense of normality, and was able to appreciate the brain aspect of awareness as a dual form of awareness (although I am still a bit confused about some of the details as to how outer reality maps into inner reality). I spent some time getting more comfortable with this new way of experiencing part of my body (and mind). I realized how I don't really know how to operate my whole body, and I am just learning how, like an infant. I experienced myself as biomorphic protoplasm, an organized aggregate that has organs that extend into the world of 'mind' as well as the world of 'body.' Just as the skin protects the body from physical invaders, there is also a membrane that separates Self and Other in the realm of mind. It is the job of self-aware consciousness to stitch together these two membranes (the physical membrane includes the eyes and ears) -- this stitching is the re-creation of the perceived universe.", "The descriptions of kundalini awakening seemed to describe what I had experienced, and I agree with Gopi Krishna's assessment of it... it is a force that pushes evolution forward. I wouldn't be surprised if 'the kundalini force' turns out to be a psychoactive chemical that can flow in the nerves.", ".... I doubt very seriously that I've done acid that much.... or any psychedelics for that matter. I've tried mushrooms, LSD and peyote. I have heard that some people use LSD in psycho-therapy. I saw a television show, where I believe it was Dianne Carrol (the woman who was married to Vic Dimonne) was talking about how she was tripping on acid whilst in therapy, and that the doctor perscribed it to her for this purpose. I didn't realise that they had the alt.drugs, and alt.drugs.psychedelics... etc. I'll have to check them out one day.", "The first time I actually did acid was in a little tablet, and I believe it was called 'white lightning'. When I was in college, I was living in Baltimore, and I got involved in a band. The 'head' of this particular band was named C, he was 26, and was dating a groupie girlfriend who was 14. C had a pretty big ego, as I remember. He was always the head of the band, and wanted to play lead guitar, and sing. He also wanted us to play all his original music, but he really wasn't very good. C and I usually ended up trading lead, and I was usually encouraged by the other band members to do more, much to C's chagrin. Anyway, C had bought a house west of the city, in Woodlawn. It was a very old, very large house, and he was trying to get the other band members to move in and pay him rent. The problem was that they all moved in but none of them paid rent. ", "There were several teen-aged kids in the neighbourhood who enjoyed hanging around that house. Of course they would with all the drugs, sex and rock n roll going on there. I went over there one evening, ( It was the summer after I graduated, so I would have been 21... 1980). Someone had this white lightning, and offered it to me. I had always been frightened of doing hallucinogens because marijuana affected me so strongly. I thought that LSD would put me in a mental hospital, but for some reason, because I had finished school, and had yet to really start working or being responsible, I figured ... what was the worse thing that could happen? I would be committed? Ah, no problem. Of course, before I actually ate the stuff, I discussed it for a long time with one of the other band members. He told me about how things would look different, and how I would see trails, etc. So I ate one of the tablets, and nothing seemed to happen for a very long time. I ended up going for a walk with one of the neighbourhood girls to go buy beer, and when we came back, the others had gone off somewhere, and they didn't come back till late that evening, so it was just me and her. I think she also did some acid. I honestly didn't feel like anything was happening, except the radio was on, and they were advertising a horror movie. ", "The advertisment came on about every 2.5 minutes, so it seemed, and it had the line in it, 'It's only a movie, it's only a movie' This ad gradually became more and more ridiculous sounding to me until I found myself putting one of my socks on my hand and making a puppet out of it, getting under the table and holding the sock up so that my companion could see it, and mouthing it to the commercial everytime it came on. I remember at this point, I was laughing so hard, tears were streaming down my face, and I couldn't stop. She looked at me, and said 'you can't tell me you aren't tripping.' I swore I wasn't. After all, I wasn't seeing what I thought were hallucinations. Finally, I calmed down, and she and I sat quietly and talked. She was wearing fingernail polish that was clear, but shiny, suddenly, I started to notice that when she moved her arms about, making gestures, I was able to see the trails following her fingertips. I think this was when I realised that everything around me was different. It was like being in a whole different universe. Everything even looked pristine, and alive. ", "At one point, we went outside, it was dark out by now, and I remember looking at the street, and being aware of how the street sparkled. I had never noticed this before. Then I looked at the sky, and it looked like dark blue foil, sort of like foil wrapping paper, not the shiny kind, but the matte, etched kind. The textured foil wraping paper you buy. I suppose I tend to be a person who is very much geared toward the visual, the spiritual, and maybe a little, the philosophical, but all the visual changes I was noticing made me ecstatic. I remember also becoming extremely aware of tactile changes. There was a gentle breeze that night. I felt the breeze kiss my skin, and it was almost orgasmic. I almost felt as though I had been touched by God. I felt like I was being enveloped by all of nature. ", "I remember sitting on the front steps, enjoying all these new sensations, then looking at a few long blades of grass that were blowing in the breeze. I started to believe they were alive *and* aware, and that they were't just blowing in the breeze but were stretching toward me, reaching out to me. I remember reaching over to touch these blades of grass, then suddenly becoming aware that I was in the midst of so much life. I began to feel like I was so connected with all of life and nature. I think, at that moment, I never felt more alive. I think somehow during this trip, I also became more aware of my own *im*mortality. I seem to remember thinking about dying, and for the first time, it didn't really scare me because I seemed to be aware that my soul somehow transcended anything physical....that in some way, and I didn't know exactly in what way, that I would always exist. I felt very thankful that God had put me on earth so that I may experience the pleasures of having a body, and being able to see beauty, and to hear music, and to experience physical love and sensuous touch, which I feel are physical manifestations of the spirit. I feel humans are as creative as we are because we have a soul, it's our soulful outlet.", "Anyway, the last time I tripped was, I think about 1985. By this time, I had joined the rat race in a big way. I had bought a condominium, and was working. I began to realise that I really couldn't do this anymore. My life was no longer free and uncomplicated. When I would try to trip, I would find myself becoming bogged down with worrisome thoughts... such as getting the bills payed, making sure I did my tasks at work, suddenly there was just too much responsibility, and I felt I really needed to keep my mind sharp. Of all the drugs I had done in my life, the only one I would like to do again if I got the chance would be acid. I loved the way it made me think about things, and I know there were a lot of earth-shattering conclusions that I had made on some of my trips... many of them were forgotten by the time the trip was over. I loved the way it enhanced the enjoyment of listening to music, or listening to crickets, or listening to the breeze. In some ways, I think that death is something like this. I think that with death, because you are no longer tied to physical binds, you become much more one with the universe, and you become tuned into the true power and beauty of existance, but not in a physical way ......Ahh.... but I'm rambling. ( I tend to do this... must be all that LSD I ate. ; ) )...", "I tried LSD for the first time this past Friday/Sat - overall, I would say it was a 'bad trip' - I wasn't prepared for what it could do. And was stupid enough to take three hits total - one, then two more at +35-40 minuts, thinking it wasn't working well. At the same time, I saw some incredibly beautiful things once I stopped trying to control the trip. I was having mild visual hallucinations inside the apartment I was at, until we decided to take a trip to a center area with rocks and grass. ", "One of my friends started talking about slug trails on the rocks, which then made the stones look like giant slugs. This started to freak me out, until my mind took over and I realized why I saw them. But all of the sudden, I looked at my feet and saw things opening up on my skin - which freaked me out incredibly badly. I couldn't get away from that vision until I was safely back in the apartment - where I then began to see small heads coming off of all surfaces, and could even taste them crunching in my mouth when I swallowed water and orange juice. I was constantly scared with an incredibly high heart-rate until I talked with a sober friend, when I said 'maybe I should stop trying to fight the trip and let it happen' (or something along those lines). When he agreed, I did so, and immediately the heads I had been afraid of before became strands of criss-crossing thread filling the room side to side like a smoky haze, piling up little by little.  I was never in great fear of the 'bad' hallucinations - I knew it was in my mind, and once I stopped trying to make them go away, they did. ", "That was about 4 in the morning, and the threads became a constant whenever I wasn't concentrating on something else for the next 10 hours. If I sat with my head to the side, I could see the room slowly filling in front of my eyes, and once the room got to a certain point, the trip began to get much, much more hallucinatory, things dissolving into each other, and so on..  Throughout the night, we had watched the Matrix (actually, I watched about one scene over and over with small changes in scene and dialogue - this was during my freak out), the end of Election and then 'Say Anything.' While sitting in a chair waching the wall and ceiling, something odd started happening with Say Anything. The scenes started playing themselves backward, in my mind (I guess I had paid just enough attention to the first part to absorb it) - audio and visual. Very, very cool. ", "The next eight or so hours (4am to noon - the 'good' part of the trip) were great - I understood why people would take LSD (whereas earlier I was asking 'why in God's name did I do this to myself?'). I was seeing beautiful things (especially a friend's diploma), actually had some interesting conversations (with others and myself).", "At noon, I got a call from my parents, and they needed me to come home to help with some stuff. They wouldn't be there until 3pm, so (after freaking out once again) I decided to go home, and try to fall asleep in the guest room (which still had my old bed and stuff). Better than telling them I was on acid (no more help on tuition...). I got dressed (when I took my button-up shirt off the coatrack I had hung it on and spun it around my shoulders, two moths/butterflies flew out and landed on the chair - absolutely incredible). ", "Driving (about a five-minute trek) was fairly easy - I wasn't tripping very hard, seeing only minor visuals (yes, I know this was dangerous and stupid). Their was no sense of proportion to my truck, though. It felt like I was driving a vehicle I had never driven before. ", "I popped a 5/500 hydrocodone and a Lodeine, hoping to knock myself out. I curled up under two sets of covers with the TV onto VH1, and proceeded to sleep off and on for the next five hours, until a Nicholas Cage movie drew my attention. I was, by this time, having only minor visuals. Rather than deal with the 'rents in a 'cracked out' state, I feigned illness and stayed in bed all day. I then slept off and on until eight o' clock this morning and am feeling great. ", "Overall, with the two freakouts and a general sense for quite some time of 'when's this going to stop' - I characterize it as a bad trip. But at the same time, I have an overwhelming desire to try a smaller dose with less-violent movies (no Matrix!) and good music (we had no music at all).  I understand the great things LSD can do now and am prepared for them.", "well, when i took my second trip, I did 5 hits while walking in the forest, and as i was coming up, and walking over a bridge, i drew the lsd molecule on the railing and wrote 'albert hofmann is my father' as a joke. i'm not gonna go into too much detail on the visuals, because they weren't too much different from last time, and i'm sure anyone who's done acid know about 'em already... mainly mandalas and and peoples faces moving around. I watched trainspotting with my sitter (he was somewhat concerned due to the disturbing imagery, but for some reason i've always found that movie to be kind of life affirming and good), but i couldn't really keep track of what was going on. while watching the movie a made a few realizations: ", "The first was that evolution is a self anihilating concept, in that the species which becomes dominant inevitably destroys itself, allowing the process to start over again. ", "The second, which i realized as i pet my dog and was overwhelmed", "by the vast amount of pure, unconditional love pouring from him, was that we are all one being, experiencing itself for the sheer joy of it, which led me to the third revelation, that the point of life (or at least mine) is to be happy and to make others happy. which is why i can't stand those who disregard others feelings and only persue their own pleasure.", "As my sitter left, we talked a little, and i was nearly brought to tears by his kindness in watching me, and allowing me to be myself. I now feel very lucky to have him as a friend, because he has never judged me and he's always supported me in all my decisions.", "Later, I went to take a shower. I looked at my body and realized how ape like humans really are, and i realized that as much as we revel in our physical achievements, and our physical form, we are, as a people, ashamed of our simian heritage, although many of our postures are those of apes, and squatting on my feet, i could almost feel a tail extending from my spine...", "overall, it was a very good day, and i hope to repeat the experience before too long, but those 5 hits were the last of the 10 that i got in october and i don't have any money at the moment, so i'll probably end up taking another 3 month stint of sobriety...", "I was new to the entire drug culture, psychedelic and non, when I had my first trip. It was something that allowed me to see the deeper edges of my soul. I saw the abstractions of reality that, in turn, showed me the truth of my reality. (That's some deeep shit.) I was open to it. Heck, I was on a roll since I'd recently started smoking pot. LSD was the next logical step (bitter sarcasm). I knew things would look strange and they told me all about the severance of reality and the other reality or realities my mind would create.", "Looking back on it I wish it had happened differently. It was going to be my first trip and people I didn't know all that well had decided it would be a good idea to give me three drops. I didn't know any better, but I didn't want to spoil anything. Also, we were smoking marijuana. Great set up so far, right? (Booo.) Anyway, so it was to be the four of us, my friend P-dog (Ha! No, that's not what I really call him. Please.) and his two female friends (their names don't matter because at all the interesting points I couldn't tell them apart) and we were all going to spend the night at the girls' place. So I was with one person I knew in a foreign place, but then, at the time, like I said, I didn't know any better.", "Things started off simply enough. The four of us  were watching 'Half-Baked' and I was smoking up with them like a good little pot-head stoner should and about 10 minutes after dropping, my entire body was hit with a wave of weight, everything was suddenly very heavy. But that, I'm sure, was just the pot. I was hoping it would relax me so that if anything really crazy happened I just wouldn't care. Oh, the irony. I was all ready for the trip to begin so I just sat back and closed my eyes and relaxed. I started having what P-dog and I refer to as 'crazy thinkin',' which is basically thinking about things you never think about, nothing special. This went on for a while and somewhere along the way the movie had ended. When I finally opened my eyes all the regular lights were off and the black lights had come on. Then the fun began because the 'real' reality began its rough split with the new realities.", "Several different phases occurred. First I just sat there, listening to what the people around me were talking about. I didn't feel like moving at all but I don't know if I could have. I eventually did get up as the next half-hour or so was spent going back and forth from the kitchen with P-dog and one of the girls, trying to get my friend a drink of water. Each time we got to the kitchen he'd get distracted by something and we'd head back out and so on.", "The next phase was where I lost hold of reality. My friend and I were lying on a futon with one of the girls and I had my eyes closed, still just relaxing. This time when I closed my eyes I had crazy thinkin' and all the typical crazy patterns. Sound became light which became shapes, etc. Cool shit. That must've lasted an hour or so, I think.", "When I opened my eyes later I was alone on the futon. I found out later that my friend during this time had sort of freaked out and the girls were tending to him (sort of.) They weren't real helpful for my friend and I. He was in the other room, curled up in a ball in a closet and for some reason they were keeping me from him. So I sat down in the other room and I started thinking that he was dying or something; I got really anxious. One of the girls asked if I was ok and I guess I said I was ok a bunch of times but I only remember a couple times. I don't know why she would keep asking me but then she was tripping as well.", "While my friend was in the other room, reality had slipped away and I was trying my best to deal with that fact. I kept asking the girl with me whether or not I was 'really alive,' if I was 'really there with her.' I soon felt like I was in some high-rise hotel and I was really rich and she was a prostitute. It was what my mind had put together in trying to figure out where I was and who I was. I then became abusive with her and the other girl who was now back in the room. (I guess P-dog was still in the closet.) Since I was rich and they were prostitutes I had license to curse at them and smack them around, which I promptly did. (I regret it somewhat but they weren't really friends so I didn't stress about it afterwards.) Then I got to thinking that I was the CEO/President of this international mega-corporation. Where else did the money come from? And then the pseudo-'visions of truth' came into play.", "I felt like what happened was that I was the chief of this company and that my entire life up until that point, my real life, had just been a bad acid trip. 20 years of my life weren't real. I was blown away. I started reciting all the names and dates I could think of to see if they were familiar to the others, but of course they didn't know what was going on. I felt like I didn't know anyone around me, that who I thought they were wasn't real. I started bawling saying I was coming to them 'from ground zero,' that I didn't know anything about the world, and I didn't. I told my friend that he was now 'God' to me. I was desperately reaching to him for help, but he couldn't really help me in retrospect.", "Then I felt this amazing energy surge through me. My entire body tensed as it felt like I was suddenly omnipotent and didn't have the knowledge to control the power. And that's what I believed. I was giving off so much energy that when I opened my eyes to look at my friend, who was sitting with me on the floor at this point, it looked like I was literally blowing him away. Picture a candle that suddenly has a really, really hot heat lamp/fan blowing on it. Features just sliding back, his glasses melted onto his face, now nothing more than brown lines 'drawn' on his skin. Everything in the room was being blown away. I was terrified and I started trying to get away from it all, closing my eyes, thrusting him away. Then my brain told me I was the true God, awakening from a mortal shell. The energy I gave off destroyed the physical world. All of it, the whole universe. And now it only existed in my head. I could only really enjoy the sensation of the power for a few moments at a time because then my friend was lying on top of me trying to calm me down, but the sweat I felt on my back was blood to me and it felt like he was melting all over me.", "The last paragraph took about 4-5 hours real-time, so I'm told. It didn't seem that long. But I got to thinking that maybe there's something holding me back (returning to the pseudo-truths) that's like a little linchpin that's holding back a dam. Like, there's something I need to break through and all my potential will come rushing out like the power I felt that night. The odd thing was that in the next few months I went through some psychological testing and they found that there was only one thing that was essentially holding back my abilities. It's not a little pin that can be just popped out, but as soon as it's conquered all my abilities can 'rush forth,' if you will. I don't know if I'd do LSD again, but I am intrigued by the insights it may show me. And besides, with the way the first trip sucked, I feel like I want to 'get it right' and get the setting right for the next time, should it come.", "It had been about 8 or 9 months since my last trip, and during that time I was constantly looking for acid.  Finally, about 2 or 3 weeks ago a shitload of what I would find to be VERY strong acid came through town.  So my friend A called me up and asked if I wanted to buy some and trip with him the next day.  I, of course, agreed and we put our money together and purchased about 15 hits.  ", "The next day, I went over to his house at about 10:00 AM and we ended up dropping at about 10:30 after his mom left for work.  Right after we dropped we started to clear his room of anything that might scare us into a bad trip.  After that we started listening to some music.  ", "Suprisingly, I could feel it start to come on about 20 minutes after dropping.  I was feeling giggly and lightheaded.  We went into his living room and watched the ceiling wave and the streams of color flow through it.  A few minutes into the ceiling watching our friend J called and said he was going to come over and fuck with us.  This is when it gets a little fuzzy.  Altough I was already tripping hard I could still feel it coming on stronger.  Before J got there we went back to A's room and chilled.  That is my last fully clear memory of the trip, but I also remember a few scattered things.", "I remember J being in the room and laying on A's bed when J informs us that A's dad just got home.  It was hard for me to understand what was going on, because I would see like a few little frames of what was happening, then I would fall into my trip, and then I would come back out and see a few more frames like time had completely stopped while I was in my deep trip.  The next thing I remember is A begging J to take him to the hospital.  Then I remember being outside and running around in A's front yard into bushes and stuff.  Then I remember J holding onto me and I asked him if he was really J.  He then asked me who I was and I told him I was my drug dealer N.  Then I remember being on a porch swing and seeing the real N, some girl, some guy, and A naked in the backseat of a car.  At the time I thought that these were all hallucinations, but I later found out that they were all real.  Then we went in N's house and I came down at about 6 or 7 PM.", "During my trip I thought that all of these things were a dream.  There was even a period between running in A's front yard and sitting in the swing where J took me to his friend's house and I played with Christmas lights and could only say 'Whoa' and 'What?' that I don't remember at all.  I later learned that I had eaten 8 hits of what was said to be REALLY good acid.  A also neglected to mention that the dude he bought it from said we shouldn't take more than two.  This experience taught me that LSD is way more powerful than I thought and to respect it.  A has sworn off acid for good, I however will probably continue to explore my mind, but at much lower dosages.", "I have used LSD 27 times so far this year, I only started this year.", "Here were I live LSD is very expensive and sometimes you don't even get your trips, the dealers steal all our cash, So sometimes I would get a half but not less! Well It seems that every time I trip out something stays with me I don't have hectic flashbacks but strange visions eg: I have a permanet trail shadow following my hands when I move them around and at night all the shadows in my room moves like ghosts! ", "Its not really freaky but I think thats what LSD is suppose to do 'FREAK YOU OUT' anyways when I drink coffee the effect is worse and the longer I go without tripping the worse it gets. So when I take a Trip the effects are gone for about a week , but the hands still makes trails! This all started happening after about 6 trips! They were manily SUN FLOWERS, HOFFMAN'S & MARILYN MONROE's!", "I have experienced with LSD approximately 15-20 times.  This was not necessarily a bad trip, just an uncomfortable one.....", "We started out at 4pm, ate the tabs and called for a cab to take us to the hills where we wouldn't be bothered by reality. Earlier that day we wrote down our address on a piece of paper and took it with us, in the event that we wanted to go home before we sober up, we could hand the paper to the cab driver, and he would handle the rest.  ", "The hills are about a 10 minute drive from the house.  As soon as we arrived, I was already feeling funny.  There was a porta potty nearby, so I went in.  My friends were talking outside and the sounds were noticebly strange.  We hiked for about 10 minutes, and I was feeling really tingly, and could not stop smiling!  Now it had been about a total of thirty minutes since we dropped.  I was amazed at the speed of the effects coming on.  Walking down the trail a little more now, things are buzzing, butterflies are cicling with magnificant trails following, like a million rays of light, all red and yellow.  There were two ladies walking their dogs that stopped to chat about 30 feet away from us.  This made me really uncomfortable.  I was beginning to feel the paranoia that I always do, but a little stronger this time.  At first I could make out what the two ladies were saying, but within a couple of minutes, it was all a bunch of mush.....just like Charlie Brown's mom.  ", "We moved to a different spot, as hard as it was for me to walk at this point.  My legs felt like rubber, and I could not stop laughing.  At this point the hallucinations were starting.  I thought there were 10 or so people walking around, all with dogs.  I asked my boyfriend if it was real, and he said no.  Laying on the grass for about another hour or so I think......15 seconds seems like an hour sometimes.  My boyfriend was running up and down the hill like he was a mad man, just full of energy saying 'Yahoo, isn't this fun??'  I could not move.  I wanted something, but I wasn't quite sure what it was.  I could just not get comfortable, so we moved again.  This time into a crater-like bowl shape on the side of a hill.  Getting really dark now, there were so many things to see in this 'crater'.  Trees moving, faces forming within the rocks and making faces at me, the grass breathing.  I suddenly felt like the crater was closing in on me.  I could no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I got scared and wanted to go home.  Uneasy, and not wanting to spoil everyone else's time, I went with the flow.  ", "Next we moved up to the top of the hill where we get an incredible view of the freeway and all of the lights.  It was cold, and scary out there.  I was at a place where I just wanted to stare at the lights with all of the energy shooting off in the sky.  The clouds forming animals and people dancing.  I could not focus my eyes on one single thing, they were jumping all over the place.  I think one of the reasons I didn't have a better time is because it was dark, and I could not tell if there was someone (from reality world) standing right in front of me or not.  I had to remind myself that I was not going to stay like this.  'It's just a drug'  I kept telling myself.  My wonderful man sitting there trying to comfort me but it just wouldn't work.  Suddenly a BRIGHT light goes on in the residential area below us.  My boyfriend yells 'Everybody Down!'  We lay there in complete silence.  I could hear all of our hearts beating LOUD.  I thought it was a cop and we weren't supposed to be there.  The most horrible things were going through my head.  I was afraid I would be forced to talk to him or something.  Then the light goes off.  ", "I was still afraid to look.  Finally my man says 'It's ok, it was only somebody's motion sensor light in their yard.'  Holy smokes.  My pupils were so huge, that a mere porch ligh from 200 feet away seemed like a cop spotlight.    At this time I convinced everyone to go home.  I wanted a comfortable place that I was farmiliar with.  We ventured on down the hill throught these massive sticks sticking out of the ground as tall as we were all around us.  We obviously lost track of the trail, and could not find it.  I was practically running down the hill, frightened almost like someone was chasing me.  My boyfriend kept trying to hold me back and slow me down.  This only made me feel worse.  I was still peaking really good.  I could see the end of the trail that meets the main road.  It would look like it was 10 feet in front of my face.  I would take 30 more steps, and look up, and I was still as far away from the end as I was the last time I looked.  This went on for another 10 - 15 minutes, or so I thought before we were level.  ", "We were now walking through a swamp that was about 1 foot deep.  I felt like I was sinking in quick sand.  When we got out of the swampy area I reached down to feel my pants, only to find that they were completely dry!  Not even any mud.  :) Hehe.  Phew, almost home free, then CRAP!  We have reached a freakin' dead end.  A wire fence all the way areound us.  But this was never here before???  AAAAAHHHHH.....I think everyone was a little freaked out about this.  It was a very trapped feeling, almost clausterphobic.  I remember hearing screams from a child near by and parents yelling.  I started running.  We found the end of the fence, and called a cab.  How did my boyfriend call a cab???  How could he possibly even speak?  This made me think he was coming down, and I didn't like the feeling of having to finish my peak alone.  Waiting for the cab on the curb for what seemed like a whole night, listening to my boyfriend talk about normal real things like the economy, and buying a house someday.  I just could not comprehend this.  Here comes five pairs of headlights!  ", "Yeah, the cab is here.  We walked towards the van, waving it down.  When it stops, we realize it wasn't a cab, it was a mom with a carload of kids inside.  Boy, she must have thought we were loopy.  I am discouraged once again.  The next car that came was in fact the cab.  We got in and looked at the strange looking man about to take our lives into his hands.  He never said a word to us.  It was like he sensed our energy or something.  Going up and down hills felt like a roller coaster ride, hearing all of the creaks and cracks inside the car, with the radio on so low, but yet it was like we were at a concert.  Stop lights stayed red for an eternity, watching 500,000 cars in cross traffic going by.  It was hard to make out where we were even though I've lived here for 12 years.  ", "Still peaking in the cab, as soon as we got home and walked inside it was like the world came back all within 10 seconds.  I was no longer peaking, but still feeling effects.  We put on the Doors, and it rocked us to sleep.", "Next time, I am going to do it all during the day time.  I can't fight it.  I really just have to go with it.  I am humble, and bow down to the acid gods.  Pretty powerful stuff.", "I was surfing through your pages here and I ran across the article on LSD and Color-Blindness.  Having color-blindness myself and having done LSD, I thought I'd share with others how my color blindness affects my vision, and what if anything LSD has done for me.", "First I will explain my color blindness condition.  I am a red/green color blind person.  This does not mean, however, that I confuse red and green, like in the article that prompted this email.  The best way I can think of to explain it is that I seem to a) confuse similar colors and b) 'forget' the identification of a color.  The most prominent of these are between brown and green, red and brown (sometimes), as well as blue and purple.  If two colors (such as blue and purple) are placed next to one another, I can often tell that they are in fact two seperate colors, though I can't tell which one is purple and which is blue.", "Having (hopefully) explained that, I must say that in all my trips colors have appeared brighter or sharper, all beautiful, though I still could not tell blue from purple.  The most likely reason for this is that i've lived with my colorblindness for so long i've stopped trying to identify them.  Also most likely the reason for this is that I can still distinguish between those certain colors but not figure out which is which.", "I hope this helps some people better understand one of the few types (yes, there's more then one) of color-blindness.  At the very least it's enlightened at least one person.", "I decided to go to a rave this last weekend in New Haven, CT, in probably the largest venue I had seen a techno party anywhere, at the New Haven Colliseum.  I had been in the techno scene a few years back but kinda got jaded from the commercialism and the lack of PLUR and bad vibes that had begun to develop in the US techno scene these last few years.  however, I had never done acid at a techno party and had decided that I would give it a try, as I had grown into different interest, particularly tribal and goa trance.  ", "So I went to the rave rather late and dropped 4 hits of very clean acid, found a good spot on the huge dance floor, and began dancing along to the various trances and breakbeats.  ", "I started seeing the typical illumination effects on clarity that I had long been accustomed to, as the colors became clearer and the sounds played with my aural senses, tickling them in delightful but familiar ways.  In many ways, it felt like rolling on ecstasy, with the heightened awareness and the beauty of the scene.", "but, about an ahour and a half into the event, I noticed a very harsh, very beautiful change in gears.  In many ways, it was overwhelming, and at times, quite frightful, particularly during the darker trance tunes.  I was intoxicated by the beauty of the acid moment, without the sugar-coated overtones of ecstasy's more appealing but less powerful vibe.  At times, the room became a huge serpent, with tribal dancers riding this huge snake in cathartic rhythms of primal angst and beauty; at other times, the room soared to heights of beauty that I cannot begin to describe, reaching spiritual if not religious heights of ecstasy and harmony, as dancers probed their deepest machinery to forge a cacophony of symbiotic magic, each feeding off each other's pure energy and giving of themselves to this higher consciousness that the whole room had achieved.  ", "I cannot begin to describe the overshelming nature of the rhythms on my sense of perception and self, as I had become but a small part of a larger organism, locking into the various waves of harmonic existence with the various other dancers who drew higher strength from a communal language.  I am reminded of Jung's descriptions of archetypal communion inherent in every human's collective unconscious, as shapes and forms shifted from goblins to angels to the epitome of devils themselves....and yet, throughout this planescape of imagery and feelings, there was always the inherent feeling that it was all a great and beautiful part of the whole, and within this, all I can say was that it was a strange and beautiful trip, something I would love to do again, and yet, only because it reveals the beauty and horrors of this primal nature, of unimaginable strength and candor, without the candy-coating that other ravers may seek.", "My trip started out as usual. I had decided to just take a little liquid (6 drops; it was decent, but not great acid) by myself and just mellow out to Pink Floyd and contemplate cosmic questions and life in general. I decided to go for a walk around my block because it had begun to rain and i thought that would be interesting. It was around midnight and i'd dropped at around 10:30pm, so i was tripping pretty good. After completing my lap, i went back into a field on a hill behind my house and spun around in the rain and stared at the storm clouds and lightning bolts dancing across the sky. As i stood on the hill, i tensed up all the muscles in my body, held my breath and made my face turn red (like you would when you're taking a really intense shit, for lack of a better example). ", "I began to feel really dizzy, so i relaxed and took in a deep breath. This triggered the most intense experience of my life. Involuntarily, i collapsed to the ground. As i hit the ground, i heard an extremely loud *whoooooosh*, and then my right leg began twitching uncontrollably. It was almost as if i was watching myself from outside my body. I became somewhat scared for the person i saw on the ground shaking. I forgot who i was, where i was, what had just happened before i fell. It was like complete temporary amnesia.", "My leg only spasmed for about 5 seconds, but as i regained control of my body, i was still completely and utterly confused about my surroundings. Not only did i not know where i was, i couldn't even recognize what my surroundings were. The hill, the grass, the trees, the lights coming from surrounding houses, the road, the sky - it was like i was a newborn baby looking at the world for the first time. The only possible way for me to further describe the alien setting i was in, was that there were what appeared to be 'tiki gods' large and small everywhere, mumbling incoherently. The only thing i can remember thinking during this was, 'i've never experienced anything like this before, i have no control over my body at all.' What i saw was the most intense hallucination i've ever experienced, and i've eaten an abnormally large amount of acid over the years, and more potent lsd, too. The effects, after i fell to the ground, only lasted about 20 seconds. As soon as i was able to pick myself off the ground, i got up and maneuvered through the maze of trees, which i still didn't fully recognize, and almost zombified, i stumbled home. I went inside and began to attempt to sort out what just happened and what had caused it. I didn't remember tensing my muscles and holding my breath for about 20 seconds. ", "After i figured out what instigated the experience, i walked back up to the field to re-attempt it.  I did it again, and fell to my knees and began shaking involuntarily again. This time while i was watching my body from outside, i thought that i was a cat. I could hear an unbelievable amount of previously non-existent sounds and see the sounds being broadcast to my ears through waves. The effects again wore off in about 20 seconds, however i did once again forget my surroundings, what had just happened, and why i was on the ground.", "I told some of my friends and we agreed to try it again under the supervision of each other. I understand that what caused it was a lack of oxygen to the brain, but i still don't know if others have had the same kind of experience, if it can be dangerous, or why i reacted the way i did.", "It was right after Christmas in 1995. I had had a fight with my girlfriend and went to a rave with my guitarist friend. When we got to the party, my friend Jeremy took one hit of acid and two hits of H-bomb ecstacy. I dropped two hits of acid and began to mingle around the rave. Everyone there was already tripping and I felt kinda left out. I went to the front entrance and got a beer and sat on an old wooden bench. I sat there for a couple of hours, just watching everybody walk in and out. ", "As I began to trip, I kept thinking, 'pretty soon the cops are gonna come into this place and we are all going to jail. Confusion started to set in and all I could think is that nobody here cares anything about me and my girlfrind is gonna leave me and I'm probably going to jail. After a while I started looking for Jeremy and couldn't find him. I got scared and thought he had left me. I finally found him outside throwing up. He asked me what I wanted to do and I said, 'lets go to my house.' He agreed, and as we began to drive to my house, he said to me, 'You know, it's crazy. I can't even see the road, but I know where I'm going.'", "When we got back to the house he sat down in my living room floor and began to meditate. I went into the bedroom and looked into the mirror. I watched my face immediately cover over with hair and then crack and melt off of my scull. I got up and looked at the t.v. which had an Orlando Magic game on. Penny Hardaway was shooting free throws and his face had devil horns coming out of it and his eyes were glowing red. I felt this overwhelming sense of evil in the room. I went back into the living room and tried to focus on the christmas tree lights to amuse myself and take my mind off of the evil feelings. As I turned and looked at Jeremy, I noticed that he was sitting in the lotus position, with his hands looking like he was praying but they were pointing down to the floor. I said, 'man, I am not having fun anymore.' He looked at me but his eyes were rolled back in his head and all I could see were the whites of his eyes and he said, 'Just go with it man.' But his voice wasn't his. It was evil, dark, and eerie.", "I immediately began to shake violently and couldn't control it.", "I rushed into the bedroom and woke my girlfriend. I told her that I was about to die and that I wanted her to hold me, as she was the only thing in the room that felt alive. As I took her into my arms, something bizzare happenned. I stopped shaking and she started shaking. She got sick to her stomach and I followed her into the bathroom. As we sat in the bathroom I asked her if she would pray and ask God to make this thing leave. She said that she didn't know what to say. I urged her to do it and she did. I had been tripping for 4 hours at this time and when she prayed the trip and the shaking stopped suddenly. We went back to the bedroom after about 30 minutes, and on the way Jeremy looked at me and said,'What's wrong man?' I said,'Nothing now. I am going to bed.'", "He left about an hour later. That was my last trip. Whether you believe in demons or not, my 'friend' who was into sorcery, tried to have me posessed. I know this now. The demon couldn't have me, so it tried to get my girlfriend who was sober, and is now my wife.", "I am a preacher now, and looking back, I know that God spared my life that night. Acid opens a door to the spiritual realm that should never be opened. Be smart. Find your spiritual high in Jesus, not drugs.", "For the New Years Eve of the millenium my fiance and I decided we wanted to ring in the year with a couple of hits of LSD.  A few days before Dec 31 we each took one double dosed sugar cube because we had no idea how strong they were, and we wanted to ensure that our celebration would be both spectacular and comprehensible.", "   Coming up brought the usual menage of disquieting feelings, like everything around you was waking up for your trip to entertain you, to parade their secret lives before you.  My fiance was playing a video game at first, but as things became more intense he had to turn it off because the game was becomming too real and threatened to suck us into television.  ", "   For the first couple of hours we wandered around our house, digging through storage to find old memories.  We eventually ended up at the kitchen table with the intention to smoke some pot, but that plan got pushed to the background as we set off on a most intense, life examining conversation about being truthful, to yourself and others, and if it was possible to live a completely honest existence and not be thrown in a crazy house or in jail.", "  Soon our conversation began going in loops, which to me was a signal that some sort of critical mass was being reached, and we came to realize that neither of us had ever been with someone we could be completely honest with, until now.  That peak, and the quiet triumph that accompanied it, rode in slowly from the sea and flooded our minds.  The plateau carried us into the shower, to scrub and shed ourselves of all previous conversation until the only thing left was the final realization, and it was all so ridiculously simple.  We came into each others arms under the spray, our bodies doing what they were meant to do with absolutely no pretense.", "   When we were done there was no drop off, we both felt exactly as we had when we first got into the shower.  Making love was a creature statement, we are here, we are alive, and this is what we are meant to do.  We went back into the kitchen to try and convince our bodies that soup was indeed needed.  When I usually shower near the end of my trip, comming out of it is always a booster for me, like I expect the water to wash the LSD away and then I am impressed at how much it still remains despite my cleansing efforts.", "   He and I have since tried having sex on LSD once more (on the actual eve of New Years), and it was very different than the first, but just as intense and magickal.  I had tried it with someone else about 7 years ago, someone I was not completely honest with, and it was a disaster.  LSD strips your ego of any pretense, and bares you to the bone if you let it.", "I remember my first year at university... I had a very good friend Cory that I would study with from midnight to about 6 or 7 in the morning every night. During the wee hours of the morning we would take study breaks and debate philosophy or argue moral issues for fun. We became very open about our ideologies and eventually one night I said, 'You know what I've heard so much about, but never tried? I've always been curious about hallucinogens...' My friend replied that he too was curious about these drugs and that he'd be interested in setting up a 'scientific experiment.' He was in his third year of bio/psych and I was just starting my psychology degree. So it started....", "We researched the many hallucinogens for the next two months. I spent hours in the library reading and visiting friends to interview them about their personal experiences. Feeling comfortable with our choice, I returned to my home town to find some acid (the drug we had decided upon). My friends had all said that a half hit would likely do for my first time and that if after an hour I had only minimal effects I could always ingest another half tab. I ended up buying 5 hits total for me and my friend. I thought, 'hey, if it's weak we're better off having extra and who knows, maybe we'll really like it and want to have some more around.'", "We had planned to drop on the Friday evening and had set up several perceptual experiments that we wanted to perform. It was Thursday and I had been studying all day and night. I popped by Cory's dorm room to say 'hi' only to find that Cory too had had a brutal study day. He turned to me with a great big smile and said, 'want to do it tonight?' 'Sure!' I replied. So, we started our tape recorder and pulled out our journal book for the night.", "Journal entry #1, '12:01am first dose - 1/2 tab each, haven't eaten recently.' From what we had both heard, the expected onset time would be 20-30 minutes, so we waited... 10 minute mark, nothing. 15 minute mark, get ready! 20 minute mark, nothing yet, should be soon! 25 minute mark, still nothing but get ready! 30 minute mark, nothing... 35 minute mark nothing... 40 minute mark, still nothing... 'Hmmm,' I thought, 'this should have started to affect us by now... Well, I have been carrying this stuff around for a week in my jacket wrapped in tinfoil; perhaps the agent has been partially leeched out and the tabs are weak...' ", "So, at this point we made what was still a somewhat rational decision...we would increase our dose by one more tab each. It seemed logical, if the drug was too weak to affect us we should increase our dose.", "50 minute mark, nothing. 60 minute mark, nothing, this stuff should have started ages ago! My friend thought that we had been ripped off, but I doubted that my old school friend would have done such a thing (especially since he had tried the same batch of acid with positive affect). 70 minute mark, nothing.... So, at this point we made a decision which to today I still can not see the rationality of...we decided to take the rest of the acid. A total of 2 1/2 hits each and we had never touched the drug before in our lives.", "We moved from the dorm room to the kitchen to sit and talk. The nice thing about this area of the dorm (known as the 'cell') is nice because it has only 3 rooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen and is sealed off from the rest of the residence for privacy. So we sat in the kitchen eating chips and pop, when all of a sudden my friend Cory point to the pop can and exclaimed, 'Oh my god Greg! Put the pop can down and look at it!' I set the pop can down on the table and looked, the can started to breathe...in and out, smaller then larger. 'Cool!' I thought....then, 'Shit! We've taken 2 1/2 hits each and it's starting to kick in...better hold on!' The kitchen was the best place to be...so many small and interesting things to look at. ", "We went to the sink that had little droplets of water in the bottom of it. By 'unfocusing' our attention, we could cause strange effects to occur. The sink became this rushing current of rapids pouring down into the drain. A blink of the eyes and it was the sink again...", "There was a poster around campus that week for a band known as Anonymous... It was a picture of a punk rocker's face with really strange shadings that had obvious done with pencil. There happened to be one of these posters printed on green paper on the kitchen wall. We watched the poster for a moment. The hair on the top of his head receeded and disappeared while the shading on the face became more pronounced turning the face into that of a 'wolfman.' This is how our experiment became coded as 'The Green Wolfman Experiment.' The face cycled back and forth between that of the punk rocker and the wolfman, back and forth like the waves on the shore.", "The kitchen was full of such wonders. The doors on all the shelves buldged inward and outward. The hairs on our arms interweaved continually and the hairs on our legs grew straight out. The once plain walls were full of intricate little patterns as was the carpet just outside the door...as though some person had come by and impressed these patterns into their surfaces. I was somewhat disappointed though... I moved my hand back and forth in front of my face...no tracers... I had heard so much about tracers and I had none (but then again, I was only experiencing the onset of my first half hit...).", "It just so happened that the residence was having a formal that evening and people were milling around the floors providing a good cover for the two of us; if we acted strange, we could always have replied that we had had too much to drink. Cory's eyes lighted up and he exclaimed, 'I want to get socially interactive! Let's go out to the party and talk to people!' I was a little nervous about this and really wanted to just stay in the kitchen; however, he convinced me and out we went to the party...", "Wouldn't you know the first person we started to talk to was the person in charge of the entire residence system! Surely this was not the person to talk to while we were so affected by acid. Eventually Cory became confused by something she had said so we found a corner, sat down, and went back over the tape recorder to straighten things out. ", "TV! I wanted to see the TV! So we went to the TV room and I watched the television for about 5 minutes but there was nothing special about it. This was rather disappointing, I had hoped that the television would have warped or characters would have behaved differently or at least something. I started to talk to a friend sitting next to me on the couch. As we talked, I was staring at his eyes...they were huge and angular...much like those in Japanimation. I couldn't break my gaze at his eyes until suddenly he blinked...and his huge eyelids came down and back up in what seemed to be a series of still photographs taken milliseconds apart. I complimented him on the largeness of his eyes and then excused myself. ", "Cory and I sat down in a hallway of the residence, it was time to try our time perception experiments. A friend of ours, Sean, had sat down next to us to chat (but had no idea what we were up to). The experiment was as follows. Person A would have the watch, pen, and journal. Person B would have to estimate the elapse of 30 seconds by any means possible to them and tell person B when that time had elapsed. Person A would then right down the elapsed time and ask person B how much time they estimated had actually passed. I was first to be person B and Cory was first to be the recorder.", "'Ok, start....now!' Cory said. '1 and... 2 and... 3..', I thought but was then distracted. 'I'm sorry Cory,' I appologized, 'there's no way I can do 30 seconds... We've got to cut it down to 10 seconds...' 'No, keep going Greg, you can do it...' 'No, seriously, there's no way I'll make 30 seconds...' Cory smiled, 'I'm still timing you!' 'Stop! Stop! Now!' I shouted. Cory looked at the watch and wrote down the elapsed time. 'What's your estimated time?' Cory asked. 'Oh my gods! Atleast 5 minutes have gone by!' I exclaimed. Cory shot me a strange look, wrote down my time, and said, 'Actual time...11 seconds...'", "Cory didn't believe me, he thought I was just pulling his leg. So he became person B and I became the recorder. 'Ok, start....now!' I said as the second hand reached 12. Cory started to talk to our friend Sean. They talked and talked. All of a sudden Cory looked alarmed and turned towards me, 'Stop! Stop! Oh no! I forgot all about the experiment!' I wrote down the actual time and asked him for his estimated time. He replied, 'Oh man! Atleast 15 minutes have passed by!' I grinned, 'Actuall time: 15 seconds!' The time dilation was fantastic! I had never experienced anything like this before in my life...but there was more to come still as only the first amounts of acid had been absorped into my system.", "My visual field was vibrating. Full of patterns. Everything was patterned...and vibrating. I went to the washroom and as I came out Cory was talking to a friend of ours. As she walked away, Cory turned to me and said, 'Look! She has a metal plate in her forehead!' I looked and sure enough there it was...a Frankenstein metal-plate forehead! We laughed... But I was becoming aware of an apprehensive feeling...I wanted to go somewhere... Maybe the kitchen... Maybe the dorm room... I just felt like we had to go somewhere... Somewhere better. Anyways, we were sitting on the floor of the hallway with Sean debating about at exactly what time we had taken what 'dose' and Sean became curious. 'Dose? Dose? What did you guys take?' he asked. I looked at Cory and he at me. Cory replied, 'LS....' '....D' I finished. Sean said, 'Ohhh...' At this point Cory and myself became worried thinking that we had upset Sean or that perhaps we shouldn't have told him. But Sean turned to us and said, 'Guys, it's just that we're in a hallway by the doors of people's rooms!' Cory and myself looked up in surprise and sure enough that's where we were! Our bubble of perception had become so small and concentrated on what we were doing that we had forgotten where we were and that we should be careful with how loud we talked about what we were doing! Sean merely smiled and laughed...he then became our ground man for the night.", "Things were getting pretty intense at this point, we had plateaued at a very high peak of the drug's effect. Where there had been no tracers before, they were everywhere! When I moved, everything in my field of vision blurred off with tracers like looking between two mirrors. I felt I had to go somewhere, it was winter and I figured some cold air might do us good. We went out into the snow and marvelled at all the patterns in the snow. We watched two trees that grew and grew up to the highest reaches of the sky. A friend had said to go and look at stoplights, saying that the lights would change to different colours. We decided against going off campus since the drug's affect was so great and we didn't know what to expect. After all, I didn't want to pass out and be found in a snowbank some days later!", "We went back in and returned to the dorm. I was unable to write and unable to focus on one thing for too long due to all the patterns in my head. Not only that, but my thoughts had become lightening fast and branched out from one another...I would have one initial idea and that idea would have five sub-ideas...those five sub-ideas would have sub-ideas of their own and so on! An infinite and parallel labyrinth of active thoughts all perceived at incredible speeds. All these perceptions were very overwhelming. I turned to Cory, 'Tell you what...we've seen what we've come to see and we've done one of our experiments... Let's call it a night aand crash out...' Cory agreed and he tossed me a sleeping bag as he hit the top bunk. ", "I layed there on the floor. My mind racing and spinning...lost in the eddies of perception and thought. Time was dilated now to an unimaginable extent. I looked at the bottom bunk where Cory's room mate was sleeping...He was a Jehovah's Witness and actually kept Watch Tower magazines under his pillow... The moonlight was coming in through the window and struck his head, giving him the impression of having a halo about him. I laughed, even through my current state of stress and anxiety, at the contrast between the peacefully sleeping JW and me tripping out of my mind on the floor mere feet away. ", "I layed there for what seemed like hours. I couldn't sleep, I wasn't tired in the least. It was as if the actual mechanism for sleep had been removed from my system. Sleep just did not exist. I looked at Cory on the top bunk and thought, 'That lucky bastard! Probably asleep right now and away from all this stuff...' I quietly called out, 'Cory?' And the response came back, 'Yeah?' Apparently he was in the same boat I was. ", "We returned to the kitchen. The acid was in full-blown affect now. During the week I had had a pain in my chest that had been with me for a few days (probably a bruise from sparring). My body-perception was normal from my head down to my shoulders but then my body narrowed down to an infinitely thin point at this point in my chest, flowed down about three feet, curved around behind my back and up over my shoulder where it then flowed off into infinity. My body just kept flowing down through my chest and off into infinity through this strange curved pattern. I had also lost the comfort that one normally has of one's body. It was as if my body no longer existed...that warm cozy cloak I had worn for all my life was now gone....leaving emptiness...void...nothing... This gave me great feelings of insecurity and distress. I explained to Cory that I wished I could wrap myself up in a great big comforter or perhaps put a ballon inside my side and inflate it so that I could feel the reassurance of my body again. In times of stress, one can always retreat to one's body and hug one's self for comfort...for me this was gone.", "As I was washed over by my perceptions and thoughts, I discovered I had lost another form or retreat and comfort. Whenever you are stressed or overwhelmed you can always close your eyes. Away from the world and safe in the warm darkness or fleshy colour (if it is a sunny day or if a light is near by). I was overwhelmed and closed my eyes to escape all the visuals for a moment. But when I closed my eyes, it was still all there! Even more so somehow! I realized that I was here for the full-haul on this trip... It was obvious that the drug didn't affect the outside world reaching my retina, it was affecting my brain's processing of the visual information and my other internal processes. There was no escape...but that was ok...we had prepared ourselves so well that we knew we were on a drug and that in a few hours it would be gone. All we had to do was wait out the intensity.", "At this point, my space-time perception had become greatly affected. The best way to explain it is like this.... Imagine that space-time is an infinitly long cord going infinity far in both directions (past and future). Now, imagine our perception as an infinitly thin plane cross-secting this cord at any given point. Our plane of perception moves an infinitly small amount of distance in an infinitly small amount of time in a forward direction along this cord of space-time--thus being virtually continuous. What happen to me is that I took a 'chunk' of this space-time cord and sliced it into five sequential slices. I was aware of my normal visual field, but I was also aware of an infinitly large blackness reaching out in all directions (visual). It was upon this infinite blackness that I placed these first first slices of space-time chronologically with the first on the left movig across to the most recent on the right. I then took the next 'chunk' of space-time and sliced it again into five sequential slices and overlaid these upon the original five. The first five 'clicked' back one position but I was still aware of them. I then kept taking more and more chunks or space-time as time passed and kept overlaying them upon the groups of five that were accumulating. These five groups clicked away and trailed off infinitely away from me and upwards as they got farther moved from myself. Points of interest here were that I was simultaneously aware of 1) my normal perception, 2) my current five chunks of time, 3) all previous slices, and 4) this special infinite space in which I was perceiving space-time. As well, if one experiments with the edge of the visual field by moving your hand past the edge of your eye, you will notice that your hand gradually fades as it loses acuity and finally disappears from perception. However, all my slices of space-time had definate edges on them...like freeze-frames from a television show. They were square screens showing reality.", "Sean had come into the kitchen again and said 'hi.' He had just finished brushing his teeth in the kitchen sink when Cory came up to him trying to explain the rushing water effect in the sink. As Cory was intensely focused upon the sink and his explanation Sean reached around and turned the water on full-blast. Cory stumbled back from the sink shaken... 'Oh wow! Don't do that man!' Cory shook, 'It's like somebody whispering, 'come here... come here... I want to tell you a secret...' And then shouting as loud as possibe into your ear except with your entire sensory/perceptual system.' We all had a good laugh over that. But overall it was too intense...I sat back in a large chair...", "I turned to Sean and asked him to turn the lights off in the kitchen in an attempt to settle my perceptions... As Sean was about to do this Cory argued no, leave them on... We then got into a fun-spirited debate to see who could get Sean to turn the lights off or leave them on. Finally I said, 'Look Sean, the lights are doing me more harm than they are doing Cory good...turn them off...' Sean agreed to this. But before he could act, Cory stood up and said, 'No man! I want to get things loud in here! I want to get my stereo and play some loud music... Or get a really loud band in here!' 'Oh!' I thought amongst my perceptual rollercoaster, 'Stereo... Band... Music... Loud...' There was just so much happening that I thought I could just be perceptually sea-sick, I thought, 'yeah, you know...I could just be perceptually sea-sick with all that is happening...in fact I think I will...I think I'll puke...' So I stood up, walked over to the garbage bin, vomited and sat back down in my chair.", "Sean and Cory looked over at me nervously, 'Are you ok?' 'Yeah.' I responded. 'Would you like some water?' 'Sure...' Sean brought me some water and I had a sip. It was now that we were experiencing the suggestability that can be found in this state. At one point I used the expression of something 'splitting in two.' When I used that phrase, Cory felt his body actually split in two.", "There was also an emotional aspect to the experience. Shortly after this Cory stood up and said, 'Oh my god! I've got an assignment due Monday! What am I doing here on acid! I going to fail my course! And my girlfriend is going to be here tomorrow! What if I'm not back to normal!' He then caught himself being swept up in all this emotion and smiled realizing its irrationality... He was almost finsihed the assignment and had another three days to finish it and his girlfriend would not be here until well after the drug wore off. He explained his emotions as the worst possible gut-dropping feeling in the world, as if he had just killed his family. We laughed over this and all the odd perceptions and behavior we had experienced. ", "Sean disappeared for a minute and came back, 'Hey guys! There's overturned furniture up on 3rd floor! Want to go up and look at it?!' Cory wanted to go, but I wanted to stay put. Cory asked if I would be OK on my own and if he could go. We looked at each other straight in the eyes then in what was perhaps the most emotional experience of my life. I could have hugged him. In the middle of all these temultuous perceptions, we were the only two people on the entire Earth who were sharing and aware of them. It was a bond of friendship we have never lost, even to today. Cory left me with the tape recorder and they turned out the lights leaving me in my chair with my leather university jacket over me.", "Where once there had been no effects from the drugs, that was all that existed then. All of a sudden the doorbell to the outer door rang, 'Shit...' I thought, 'I'm in no condition to be interacting with people right now.' So I stayed in my chair. The door rattled and then someone opened it with their keys. I heard people walking towards the kitchen from the outer door, two guys and a girl. They stopped at the kitchen and smiled in at me, 'You look like your pretty comfortable there!' 'Yeah, had a bit too much to drink tonight so I think I'll just crash here...' I replied as the world swirled within and without me. 'Ok, well sleep tight!' she laughed and they left.", "At this point in the trip I became something that I can not put into words... I became atemporal. I existed without time...I existed through an infinite amount of time. This concept is impossible to comprehend without having actually perceived it. Even now in retrospect it is hard to comprehend it. But I do know that I lived an eternity that night...", "Eventually Cory returned and asked, 'How long was I gone?' I replied, 'I couldn't honestly tell you if my very soul depended upon it...' And I was honest. He could have been gone 3 seconds, 15 minutes, hours, days, months, or years...I had no idea. All I knew was that he was the best sight that my eyes had ever seen at that moment of my life. We decided to try crashing out again for awhile and returned to the dorm room. ", "As I laid on the floor I thought, well, I came into this with a philosophical/scientific purpose, I might as well keep work at that goal. So I started to analyse me speeding and labyrinthing thoughts. I had two theories based upon the correlatory nature of my thoughts (A is like B, B is like C, D is like F, etc...) : 1) perhaps this was a process that was always occuring in my brain looking at all different avenues of logic or possibility before choosing the most appropriate. All these hundreds of lightening fast related thoughts were a natural process that I was only now aware of by means of the drug I had ingested. Or, 2) perhaps this was a dysfunction in my brain due to the drug and was created soley by the drug interaction. ", "So I decided on another experiment. I would take two random things and see how this system correlated them. I chose 'the world' and 'a loaf of bread.' My brain thought of thousands of correlations (they both have a crust, they are both soft in the center, they both have things living on the outside of them, etc...). I wish I had been able to right to record more than these few that I can remember to see if they all made sense the next day. However, I was in no condition to write...", "I laid on the floor for ages waiting the drug out. Finally, my perceptions went from 'clicking' along to a short moment of continuous perception, and then back to clicking. Eventually the moments of continuous perception became longer and longer and the 'clicking' moments shorter and shorter. I was almost completely back to my normal perceptions. But, I could still force visual effects to occur by unfocusing my attention to make the ceiling buldge and breath. I called over to Cory and he was at the exact same stage and also just as wide awak as I was. We got up and I went home to grab a quick shower. An hour later we met for breakfast. We both ordered huge amounts of food but barely touched our plates. We spent most of the morning talking over the experiences of the night before.", "We were surprised by the absolute parallel of our two trips (perceptions, duration, cycles, etc.). But then again, we had both gone in with alot of research time put in, both had the same attitude towards 'the experiment,' had similar body structures, were in the same environment, and had taken the same amounts and batch of LSD at the same times. There were only the more extreme space-time effects that were unique to myself. ", "Later I went back to my home town and my friend asked me about the acid trip and how much we had taken. When I told him we had taken 2 1/2 hits each he was shocked. He said, 'Greg, you guys didn't take 2 1/2 hits of acid each, you took 5 hits each. I've been doing acid for years and I've never had acid that strong before!' Cory and myself had a retrospective laguh over that one... ", "As I walked home after my breakfast with Cory, I just took the world in... All the sights and sounds of the early morning, and the feeeling of my body and mind. I was glad to be back to reality... I had gone beyond the experiences of my life and beyond the experiences of all my friends who had done acid for years just hours ago. I was glad that I had gone so far, it gave me enough insight into myself and the world that I could think a lifetime just on the one evening's experiences. It was impossible to understand reality and our perception of it without having a contrast to our 'normal' reality. I now had that. And enough insight to make my entire lifetime philosophically worth while. In the midst of my extremely intense trip I promised myself that I would never do acid again (altough a couple of days later I found myself pondering what it would be like to take a smaller dosage!). But I have never regretted my experience...", "(Sorry about the length, I hope this will be of use to some people interested in the acid experience and what the pros/cons can be of it. I neither encourage or discourage drug use...I only say to those who ask me about drugs that if they are really interested in trying a drug to go out and learn about it first and know what they are getting into. Learning about the drug is also an important mental preparation that can add much mental support in the middle of a trip. If you understand something strange, you will not be afriad of it.)", "It was towards the end of my freshmen year of high school. (It had been a year of many changes for me.) I had gone to an all boys private school in 7th and 8th grade where I was miserable. They were rich,shallow and boring. I was middle class,laid back and energetic. When I finally returned to Hanover County public schools from my two year exile, I was enthralled. I made up for everything I had missed. I partied, I got drunk, smoked weed, hung out with girls every chance I got and felt good. My many experiences of being intensely stoned stimulated my already curious, creative and active imagination. I found the 'distortions' of senses thrilling. But I wanted a more intense experience. ", "So one night in drivers ed i happened to speak to a dealer. The next night i was presented with 10 tabs of what he reffered to as wizard of oz. A friend and I ate five each on night with a little campfire in a field next to his house at 12:00. We sat there talking for a while not knowing what to expect. At first I felt like a child finding everything novel and entertaining. Eventually, the giggling turned into occasional bouts of intense staring and engrossing visual images. 'My' old world was transmogrifying into Jung's archetype's and the Buddhist void. Little cognition was involved in my activities and events are difficult to recall. (Probably because it is state dependent) We went for a walk to the other end of the field. We suddenly stopped as the darkness felt like liquid enveloping us and reading our every thought. The usual field was now a horizontal cliff which frightened us even though we still can't recall why. Perhaps it was fear of the unknown or a projection of some fear embedded in our conciousness we were not ready to face. Anyways,we unanimously decided to make our way back to our campsite. Our pace became hurried. It felt as if the faster I walked, the faster the 'object' that was back there was coming faster and faster. Regardless,we strained to walk casually. I looked at the ground and my feet to keep focus on the task at hand. An old corn stalk on the ground suddenly turned into a corpse and grabbed my ankle. It finally let go and I hauled back to the warm shelter of the campfire which nestled us from the darkness of the unknown. ", "At this point my already racing treadmill of a mind was blazing. It was approx. 2:00 when we had returned to the campfire. We decided to lay down and relax. From there I was taken into depths of undescribable and unforseen places. Were they places of my mind or other demensions I don't know because 'I' was not concious or attentive during the period of 2:30-6:00. The eyes simply observed as my usually racing mind apparently stopped doing and started being. No deadlines, no worries, no emotions, just existnece in as far as I have yet experienced it's purest form. ", "When my ego had returned from vacation, my friend and I sat in awe and could only say wow. I felt as if the universe had been passed into the neurons of my brain and engraved in my gentics. Preconscious cellular processes were now understood to me. I could feel the platlets in my blood cells forming. The quick of my fingernails pushing and growing every so slowly. At 8:00 after taking a walk into the woods and playing catch with a water bottle, we went inside to have breakfast. We laughed our balls off at his dad telling old fighing stories and looking at his face still looking like a goblin. I went back home about 9:30 and fought off falling asleep until I gave in and slept for hours. My dreams were strange and acted like an exstension of the trip. When I woke up the next morning I felt refreshed and viewed life in a new aspcet.I also now knew that I could stop my ever nagging mind from bothering me when I needed to, just as wizard of oz had shown me. That experience sparked a burning passion for knowledge, spirituality and a zest for life I sometimes have forgotten in this fast paced and hurried life Americans lead nowadays.", "I was 18, and I had been backpacking through Asia with my father, who had hidden two hits of blotter inside his camera. He was planning on finding a place to give me the LSD as sort of a 'rite-of-passage.' He himself had recently had a very minor cocaine related 'heart-episode' and was reluctant to take any chances with the LSD this time around.", "So, about 2 months into our travels, we found ourselves on a houseboat on Lake Dal in Srinigar, the capital of Kashmir. Talk about paradise! Thousands of beautiful wooden houseboats, canoe-like boats called 'shikaras' that paddled from houseboat to houseboat selling food, hashish, trinkets etc.... No motor are allowed on Lake Dal, so it was quiet except for the sound of eagles screeching, kids playing and the 'Call to Prayer' wafting periodically through the air. Indian tea served in the morning and the afternoon... Truly paradise.", "We're sitting on our houseboat, and a shikara comes up carrying a middle-aged couple. The male was standing up in the boat singing an Irish drinking song. A real personality. He was a total blue-collar, pub-scrapping Irishman who worked for many years as a welder, but discovered that he was a mathematical genius, put himself through school, and now is a professor at a prestigious university in England - all the while remaining course, vulgar, happy, and drunk on whiskey. In any event, they shared our boat with us and we became good friends.", "We traveled together, the four of us, to Ladakh, the Tibetan region of India, high in the Himalayas. We stayed in a village called Leh which was as Tibetan a village as you could find.", "(and before I get flamed for being a stupid tourist, please understand that this was a number of years ago... ok - I'll accept the criticism of being a stupid tourist)", "At some point, Dad & I decided that this was the place where I should be initiated into the world of psychedelics. I started by taking a quarter of a hit. When John (the Irishman) got wind of this, he expressed interest, and the second hit was given to him. After about 30 minutes, I felt nothing, so I took another quarter. Another 30 minutes passed, another quarter. I ended up taking all four quarters = a full hit.", "Still nothing had happened. My father and I climbed up the mountain to a cemetary above the village. They call the landscape in this part of Tibet a 'moonscape,' and truly, aside from the whitewashed Buddhist Stupas that aparently marked graves, it looked as beautiful and desolate as photographs of the surface of the moon.", "The village was below us, a maze of adobe-like buildings and narrow winding streets. All of a sudden, something began to change within my body. I was feeling a bit of a change. At that moment, the Call to Prayer for the villages few moslems began, amplified by a cheap speaker mounted on one of the village mosque's minarets. I stood up and a giant grin came over my face. I was tripping.", "Dad and I walked the winding path down the mountain back into the village, with me giggling and describing the sensations I was feeling along the way. We ran into John who was sitting outside of our rooms looking at flowers.", "So there we were - two first time trippers, tripping our balls off in this village, with shit-eating grins on our faces, smoking bidis like fiends and generally making fools of ourselves.", "I have rarely had acid since that has been as powerful as this was. Both of us experienced tremendous distortions in time. I remember lighting a cigarette and tripping for an eternity on the surrounding countryside, returning to my cigarette only to discover that less than a millimeter had been burned.", "The Tibetans knew something was up, and there was a constant parade of beautiful teenage Tibetan girls coming around to flirt with us and watch us. We were in a garden-area, and there was a really old guy who seemed to live in the garden. He'd kneel in the garden and pray for hours on end, spinning his prayer wheel. I can still remember really tripping on the sound of his wheel spinning around and around.", "At some point we ran out of cigarettes and had to make the excursion into the village to buy more. Imagine two tripping fools cruising into the Tibetan equivalent of a 7-11 laughing uncontrollably and trying to buy cigarettes.", "The streets were muddy, and as we waled to and from the store, we passed dozens of strange and exciting people - people leading water buffalo, Tibetan monks, naked kids, Kashmiri traders and carpet salesmen, etc.... It was like a circus and it was (naturally) enhanced by the drug.", "My father had told me that one thing he really enjoyed when doing LSD was looking at himself in the mirror and watching the flesh on his face melt off.", "Sure enough, when I tried, I got the same results. I haven't been able to reproduce it since. I thought it was hilarious.", "Anyway, as often is the case with LSD, after 10 hours or so, it got a little tiring. I started coming down and John started getting a little weird. I remember him running down the road saying 'The cloud is a fucking fish,' or something like that, then laying down in a field of rubble and laughing and laughing...", "It hasn't been as good as that since. It sure was a great place to learn about the power and beauty of LSD.", "The incident which I relate occurred 28 years ago, but I still remember it as if it happened yesterday. I was tripping on acid on a weekend evening, and I was well on my way, being very stoned. I liked to walk over across the road from my house where there was a pond with an open field all around- no houses- and someone had built a gazebo in the middle of this pond, with a narrow wooden walkway out to it. I was enjoying the acid trip as I usually did, when suddenly, off in the horizon, I noticed a flaming round ball shooting thru the sky, then going behind some trees. The ball was an orange flame color, larger than say an airplane light would be if you saw it at night. This was way off in the horizon. Before I could think what in the hell was that, I felt a tremendous force over the pond- it was light and energy, and the force of it pushed my chin back, and forced me to lie down on my back in the grass at the edge of the pond. I couldn't look at it- the force was too great!", "And then I heard a voice. It seemed to come from some place both inside and outside me. It said 'Don't look at me, or you will die!' At that time, I chose not to look at it and I lay there on the grass feeling this incredible force over me, pushing my chin back.", "I felt tremendous exhilaration, but not fear. Then the voice said to me,'Do you want to come with me? Or do you want to go back to your friends?' In that instant, I felt that if I went with the force, I would surely die. So I said 'I want to go back to my friends.' And I am sure that I did not move my lips, but the speaking was by thought except I could hear it. ", "In a moment, the force slowly began to lift up and fade away, and when it was gone, I got up and ran back to my house. My friends were there, and I told them what had happened, but they didn't believe me and they thought I was having a weird trip, though not a bad one. So I just accepted that they wouldn't believe me, but I know that it happened to me, and I can still remember it clearly 28 years later.", "As I sit here at my computer terminal and reflect on the last few years of my life I am still in disbelief. I wanted to share my story of experimental drug use and where that road took me. Six months after I started using marijuana, a friend ask me if I wanted to try LSD. At this time of my life I was a second year college student who was happy, athletic, religous and success-driven at school. I came from a perfectly innocent life that epitimized 'Leave It To Beaver'. I never even drank until I 19. Innocently though I began using pot on rare occasions and I eventually became facinated by the unknown drug, LSD.", "After a little enticing from a friend I decided to trip. This first experience was wonderful for me. I had so much fun and seemed to learn so much through new perceptions that I had formed from tripping. I didn't trip again for one month but when I decided to drop again it became a habit every two weeks for 4 months. I usually dropped two gel tabs on those weekends and enjoyed the company of friends wherever we were and whatever we did.", "During this time I became facinated with the new ideas that were forming as a result of taking acid. I felt that I was becoming smarter, or maybe more aware. It seemed perfectly normal that my friends and I tripped every two weeks. We were doing good in our college courses overall and it seemed perfectly balanced. As I reached the third month in which I was tripping it was more about expanding my mind than anything else. Pot is to get high and feel the buzz but LSD is for the knowledge and experience. I knew at the time that there are consequeces for every action that we take but I believed the consequence of taking acid was the responsibility of more knowledge and a loss of innocence. By the time I was leaving college for the summer my mind was semi-fried. I believed that it was perfectly permissable that reality could be a hoax, an illusion of the mind. I battled thoughts on how there was no such thing as a common shared reality since I had learned through tripping that everybody perceives differently. In theory we could all just could be brains in a tank hooked to wires or that nobody else really existed.", "I chose not to do drugs of any sort over the summer in response to my frazzled state of mind. When I returned to college, however the temptations were too great. My use continued on a less frequent basis but my trips were becoming wilder. I went to parties all night long, taking everything to the limit. In addition to smoking pot, I know had tried mushrooms, opium, hash, nitrous oxide and an array of painpills. I was changing due to my experiences with acid. I became incredebly interested in philosophy and abstract concepts; something I never really could get into. I lost all my faith in God or rather I was became confused. I became more introspective and constantly thought about philosophic notions. I was still learning and that was my rationalization to sustain my usage. My trips were still wonderful experiences that I enjoyed immensely.", "The problem point came in January of 2000. A lot of acid became available and I bought it. In January I ate 30 hits of paper. By the first of February I would and could just stare at the wall for hours...just thinking in a dazed out stupor. I felt different than ever before. I reached a new ability to think during this time. The way I describe it is as the equivelent to water busting through a damn full-force in all its fury. Now I began reading philosophy and other interests that came to mind but totally neglected every other area of my life. I couldn't get enough of books that stimulated my mind...that is books outside of my school curreculium.", "I began partying to all hours of the night, drinking and smoking pot. Retrospectively, I was in a state of depression that fueled a circular drug frenzy...I was depressed so I drank and drinking and using drugs caused more depression. I could never get it through my thick skull that the acid had sent my bio-chemicals on a rollercoaster ride and it would take sometime for them to reestabilish normal levels. Four weeks before my graduation I realized what I was doing to myself. I still partied like no tomorrow but now I was trying to make-up for all the school work I hadn't been doing. I had missed two-thirds of all my classes and my professors were simply not simpathetic to somebody who never came to class.", "I stayed-up around the clock doing projects and work almost in a cumpulsive manner. I couldn't do it. I was smart enough, had the potential to ace all of my courses but I couldn't do it. I put 300% in at the last minute and no matter what I did, I coudn't fix it. I came VERY close to having a nervious breakdown. I drank and drank and drank just hoping to go numb. I failed classes that were nessessary for me to graduate...JUST expanding my mind had now cost me a college degree. I was messed-up in the head from all this. I had such rage and depression problems. I attempted the two last courses I needed in the fall, while working part-time. I was convinced that I was behind my problems and that 'I could handle it'.", "When I started my classes though I was on a 5 day DXM binge. I went to my first class and was in such a state that I couldn't really talk or write which was apparent from my notes. My vision was so blurred that I could see about 15 feet in front of me. Shortly thereafter I bought a sheet of paper. I was the party. Whenever I wanted to trip, me and whoever around me could trip if the wanted. I tripped with my friends and then by myself. After a while I knew that I had to get rid of the rest of the acid because my life was starting to resemble the movie 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.' It didn't matter though...it was too late. I became so depressed for about 6 weeks that there were times I didn't want to get out of bed. I knew I could do my school work but I got so overwhelmed that I just worried myself into submission. I just couldn't handle any stress because I was so emotionally unstable. I had no illusions this time about why I was so depressed. Hind sight is 20-20 goes the common saying...I just never invisioned the conseqences to be so severe. My classes were a failure...I began to beat my depression but not in enough time to pass my classes. 'What is wrong with me' I wondered? but I already knew.", "I am now getting ready to graduate one year late. I got my act together and I will soon be a college graduate. I spent an entire year in total depression, a constant feeling of void and anxiety because I couldn't see that acid was a drug just like any other drug. It almost took from me everything and everybody I cared about and this is something I am deeply ashamed of. I am not saying not to try LSD, but what I am warning of is the severe consequences that are at hand if you are ready to overconsume acid or any drug for that matter. Go ahead and seperate your usage from my experience if you want to try to make yourself feel normal but the truth is I was invincible just like you. I never believed I had a problem until it was too late...DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU! The narrator from the movie Magnolia said it best 'You might be through with the past, but the past ain't through with you'.", "The first time I took acid was with friends, which is the best way to do it. We were in a bar, drinking, and the guy (whose name shall be J.) said he'd picked up the acid, and we should go do it now. I said sure, and him, his girlfriend 'L.', and I went down to the basement of the bar, which was empty. There were some tables there and we split up the goods: one hit each. I'd read up on acid and its effects beforehand, mostly through the USENET FAQ, but I remember thinking of another friend's words: that he hadn't known what to expect when he first took acid, for all he knew he was going to die. Of course, having thought this it occurred to me that I should think of this kind of thing, 'cause it might bring on a bad experience. Having thought this I wondered if knowing I should have good thoughts would be enough to get rid of bad thoughts and thus ward off a bad experience. Realizing I was floudering in a sea of ignorance, I proposed we go back upstairs and finish our drinks. ", "My friends agreed, and I felt better immediately. After we finished the pitcher we went walking around town a bit. It was a late autumn night, and the air was cool, but still comfortable. I was a bit tense, and paying attention to my every perception. I thought I felt something so I asked my friends and they said, no they didn't feel anything. We went to a party store to pick up some whisky and coke-bottles to mix it in, then we headed towards a park. We ran into a friend who had a very intense personality, and L. said she thought it was 'cause he'd done a lot of the drug that we were currently on. I thought about this a bit, but wasn't worried about it at all, for some reason. I felt a light buzz tingling my body, like something exciting was going to happen. We went to the park. The moon was out and everything was clear, and I realized that the night was clearer than I'd ever noticed. The tree-branches were more clearly defined than I'd ever seen. We sat on a hill and smoked some herb, and talked about stuff. We were no different than any other people who might be sitting there talking about life and the people we knew and our jobs and what we wanted to be doing a year from then, only we were buzzing and everything around us looked sharper and more alive.", "After a bit, L. got up and said she'd be right back, and she took off running down the hill, and ran around in a large circle through the park, her arms open. Then she came back, and rolled down the hill, and came back. J. was watching and smiling, and I was looking up at the trees again. It occurred to me how much the trees did look like fractals, and suddenly the mathematical beauty of the trees was clearer to me. The complex mysterious equations that dictated how the trees were pushed up out of the ground towards the sky were suddenly more apparent; and I also realized how these equations dictated the growth of the grass, the rolling of the hills, even our very bodies. I had a sudden respect for the complexity of things, with an intensity that I hadn't had before, and this complexity seemed sharper in everything I turned my eyes towards. I made myself remember that moment, and wondered if I'd have any more insights, but we just kept talking and walking around, and everything was sharp and in focus, and eventually we ended up going to our separate homes and that was that. I didn't die, I didn't achieve enlightenment, but I did have a good time and eventually wrote a haiku about trees looking like fractals.", "I have done acid before, but never this much. Actually, the last time i dropped i only did 2 hits and this time i dropped 5 hits, which is a huge step up.", "0:20 - get a slight body high and lights seem to get brighter than normal", "1:00 - everything has become very distorted, there are patterns all over whatever i look at", "1:30 - here comes the peak, having a conversation is simply impossible, the concept of a phone completely escapes me, time has dwindled to almost non-existence, and the patterns are even stronger and i have some long ass trails. i don't even have to unfocus my eyes", "2:00 - it feels like i am in a movie, out-of-body type feelings, and the feeling that anything i do right now doesn't matter, i can not hear anything except for what is in the room and what i do hear is accompanied by echos, or when my friends try to talk they sound almost like computers", "2:30 - my senses are being completely switched around, like if my hearing is gone i would be able to feel what my girlfriend is saying or see it.  And the times that i can see the patterns and trails are even stronger", "6:00 - the effects start to wear off but i don't come all the way down until 10 the next morning, and all day today my brain has felt completely fried. but overall, i had a wonderful time and it didn't feel like a bad trip at any time.  i personally thought it was better than rolling, which most people wouldn't agree with but then again, i am a little weird.", "I wasn't originally going to do LSD, we were at Rottenest (a small island off the coast of Perth, Western Australia) for leavers week, after school had finished for the year. I was with a big group of my friends, was having a great time.", "It was the last night we were there and we wanted to get some E's. Unfortunately everyone had run out and we couldn't find anything. One guy had some meth but we took our chances and kept looking elsewhere. Nothing could be found. This whole time we knew that one of our friends had some tabs of LSD but we had decided not to trip cause of what we'd heard. Anyway after searching for ever I decided to take a tab, my best friend said he didn't want to which was cool, I was with a couple of my other friends who were experienced trippers.", "It seemed to take for ever to work. We went on walks all around the place, and then it finally started working. Everything suddenly became so funny, laughed at anything. My friend and I decided to go for a walk, down the jetty, on the way we passed a house that had a strobe light going, and it was also raining at the time. Anyone who's seen rain with a strobe light will know what I'm talking about but it just looked so awesome. After watching that for a bit, we kept on to the jetty. As I said it was raining, and there was puddles everywhere, all these puddles on the asphalt looked very purple and just amazing, one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. It looked like the surface of some distant planet in the solar system, like purple dunes.", "We  walked to the end of the jetty and watched lights out on the water and also the lights of Perth. So far my trip was amazing, I was having such a good time.", "It was the walk back to our place when things started to go a little bad. I suddenly got blotches in my eyesight, and I realized it was because I was getting really hot, I took my jacket off and that helped a bit. Though I did start freaking out a bit, started to panic. Now ive thought about this a lot, and I think if what happened next didn't happen I would have had a great trip. We walked back to our house and noticed a couple of people standing around the front door. The lights inside were off and everyone was asleep. As we got closer we could see they were trying to see inside, looking to see if they could get in without waking anyone (presumably to steal what ever they could). I yelled out to them as we got closer and they turned around. They were obviously on speed or glue or petrol or something cause they were amped up big time. One guy was pretty big, and he was 'play' fighting with us, trying to intimidate us, they said they were looking for a cigarette. We said we didn't have any. Then one of the guys said if we 'start' on them, he'll pull his knife. This freaked me out big time and I started to get really scared. I'm not one for fighting, I hate knives and guns and the things that come along with them. We said we weren't going to start and luckily they left pretty quickly.", "From there things got bad. I got REALLY paranoid and started panicking even more. What was worse was that all my really good friends had deserted me for their girlfriends, which was disappointing to me because they had all said when I told them I was going to trip that they were going to look after me. I felt really alone, I felt I had no one, I kept trying to find someone to look after me but no one would, everyone seemed so fake.", "The guys I was with told me to smoke some pot to settle myself down but I didn't want to, I'd given up pot and didn't want to mix drugs. So I just had to calm myself down. We locked up the front door pretty good and all sat around the back, however I could not get rid of the feeling that those guys were going to come back.", "Finally I found some sort of relaxation, we went on a walk around the place in a big group which made me feel better. Then went back to our place and crashed. Trying to sleep was almost impossible, once I got into one position something about it would annoy me so I would change positions and the same thing would happen. So I just thought fuck it, I'm gonna ride this, so I watched some awesome 'dot' patterns on the roof and around me, it was great.", "Next thing I know I wake up, somewhat dumbfounded but that was to be expected. After that night though it took me a while to forgive my friends for not looking after me when they said they would.", "Will I LSD again? No. I wanted to try it, and I have. I know what its like. From what I've read on Erowid my trip was definitely not as intense as some others. I will always wonder what my trip would have been like had those 2 guys not threatened us and scared the shit outta me.", "Oh one thing I forgot, later that night when we were on the walk, we ran into the big guy who threatened us, his friend no where to be seen, after realising it was him, I told the rest of the guys and we started to walk back to him, there was security guards all around him though, they had been following him. We told them what him and his friend has done and they told us that they had been terrorizing the place all night. The big guy had assaulted a young girl. I'm not one to take pleasure in someone else's pain but this guy was beat up really bad. Someone else (probably a number of people) had gotten to him first and he was for lack of a better word, fucked. He was limping really bad, holding an arm and bleeding. We left him like that, with the security guards watching him closely.", "I love Acid. I love it, but not as much as I love life.", "I will never take acid again. My 10th experience with it was so disillusioning, that I am now considering doing no drugs other than those I have already tried and have not had bad experiences with,  specifically alcohol, marijuana, mushrooms, and codeine.  (I have tried a 'White Buddha' pill of Ecstacy, which I liked, but it was not anything like my friends described rolling to be.) ", "Acid is a wonderful drug; however, it is also a BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD drug.", "One night at college a few months ago there was an 'Acid Jazz' show at the Student Union.  It was free, and there was a keg in the loft.  The music was ludicrously good--just drums, bass, and guitar in moving modes and harmonies like I have rarely heard before.  Soon after entering, I saw my friend G buying something.  I approached him and said what's up to G and asked the dude what he was selling.  He told me it was pure MDMA.  (Which, by the way, is one of the biggest drug shams since 'triple-dipped' acid.  Unless you get a testing kit, you don't know what in God's name is in there.)  At the time I wasn't really interested in spending $20 on a good time, so I said 'No, thanks.  I'm all set on that.'  I obtained a 32 oz. cup for the keg, waited in line, sat down in the balcony and started groovin' to the tunes.  We started smoking some bowls of dank, and soon my friend A asked us if we wanted some acid.  G got some, and I asked how much it was.  He said it was free.  I said 'Well, shit.  Gimme two hits.' (I like to test out a batch of cid before I start indulging.  I'm sure glad I did that time.)", "We started smoking some bowls again, and about a half an hour later, I started feeling it.  I told G he better stop drinking because with Ecstacy, you never know what's in there to interact with Alchohol.  I was starting to feel pretty fucked up, and I was starting to hallucinate, so I threw away my beer as well.  It was about half full, so I had drunk about a pint.  Within 45 minutes of intake, I was tripping--this was some good acid.", "The music was pulsating, and I could actually see the vibrations in the air, and the strife between the competing harmonies.  Several times I went to the bathroom to get some water.  On the way one of the times I saw A, and gave him the thumbs up.  He said, 'Do you need more?'  I said,  'You have MORE?'  He said, 'You feeling good?'  I said 'Holy Shit, this is great stuff.'  He said, 'That's good, I want people to remember this night.'  I sure do.", "The rest of the night was kinda spotty in my memory.  I remember people throwing playdoh around--that was funny--and I remember intermission.  I thought it was over.  I said, 'I can't believe it's over, they were so good!'  My friend E said, 'It's not over, it's just intermission,' and I said, 'Oh thank God!'  That's the last thing I remember.", "I woke up in the hospital with a woman leaning over me.  I could feel something in my throat and a pain in my penis.  I went to feel my dick, and the woman said, 'You're in the hospital, you had a seizure...You're in the intensive care unit, you have a catheter in your penis.'  I said, 'Aaaagggghhhhuuuuuhhhhhhhuuuuggguuhhhh,' and i tried to tear this weird tube out of my throat.", "Apparently, my roomate had found me lying in my bed in my dorm room having a violent seizure, foaming and bleeding from the mouth.  He called 911.  I was lucky.  Apparently, I wasn't breathing and had a very low heart rate.  They had to intubate me.  I was five minutes away from death, and a flip of a coin away from sreious brain damage, paralysis, or being a vegetable.", "I was terribly sore for days--I could barely walk.  My lip was also torn up.  Soon, I had to undergo counseling, treatment, and drug tests.  Eventually I was sent home on involuntary medical leave for missing and failing to prouduce urine at a few drug screens.  I am now clean of all substances, including marijuana (my drug of choice), and am preparing to return to school for the spring semester.", "Many of my friends at school did not believe what had happened to me.  Some of the upperclassmen told me, 'you can't die from acid, that guy probably gave you bleach,' and I now realize what myths there are surrounding acid.  I have no history of epilepsy, and I know this is not an uncommon thing because it later happened to one of my friends from a different batch.  My friend G also took 12 hits of the same acid, drank, smoked pot, and had taken ecstacy that night and he was fine.  It was great acid, if not some of the best i've ever had; however, you still take chances even among the best and completely unadulterated of acids.  While I love tripping, and see it as an enormous part of my spiritual life, and am glad that what happened happened so that i do not do acid again and kill myself, I do not wish what happened to me upon any other soul, for it was a truly terrifying experience.", "It was April 1997 and I was packing for a school band trip to Tennessee. We would be gone for 5 days, so I wanted to be certain I had packed everything necessary. As I was in the middle of this, the phone rang. It was one of my friends telling me she had found some good acid for me. As my parents were at home, she couldn't bring it to the house, and I was leaving in the morning at 6:30, so I told her I would put the 15 dollars in an envelope and throw it out into my front yard, I even put in a couple of quarters in order to make the envelope heavier, in order for it to fall where I wanted it...So, I opened my second-story window and threw it down. My friend came by, picked up the money and taped the cellophane which enclosed the dipped paper into the inside of my mailbox. Upon rising in the early morning hours, I took my suitcases down to the driveway before my parents could follow me and quickly extracted the package from its hiding place. I had 3 hits in my possession now. I was so anxious. When would I take them? On the road trip? When I got back? On top of all this, it would be my first trip! What amazing experiences I was expecting! I accidently lost one of the squares of paper, though, when I was cutting along the penciled lines which separated each hit...it somehow fell behind my dresser, but I had to leave, so I departed with my two hits.", "I got on the bus for the long ride at about 7:00 that morning. It was extremely boring. I attempted to listen to some music on my headphones and do some schoolwork, but nothing of interest came to me. Then, I remembered that I had the acid. Wow, I thought, that's something to do. (something extraordinarily stupid, but i didn't realize it at the time.) So, not actually realizing how incapacitated I was about to become, I placed one of the squares onto my tongue. By this time, it was about 9:00. Although I was aware of the effects of LSD, anyone who has ever tried it knows that there is no way to tell someone inexperienced exactly what to expect. I waited for about 30 minutes, and, not feeling anything yet, decided to take the other hit. By 10 AM, I was hit with the most utterly fantastic experience that I could never even imagine. Each of my friends was being seen for the very first time. My friend in the seat in front of me turned around and placed her over-sized headphones on my ears for a minute. I explored every note touched in the song. I swam around on the sound waves. The music flowed straight through my mind. I was completely overwhelmed. ", "Since all of my frineds on the trip were completely anti-illegal anything, I was the only one who was aware of my situation. One friend inquired as to the strange state which my eyes were in, but i just said i didn't know, and continued to awake for what seemed like the first time ever. Every voice on the bus surrounded my mind. One would call out my name in slow motion while the other would echo an infinite number of times. I almost couldn't bear the liveliness around me. I felt as if I was essentially progressing forward, but at the same time, one stream of my consciousness was jetting into the future, while another was lurching behind in the past. everytime someone said something I felt as if I knew what they were going to say before they did, but at the same time I was hearing it for the first time when it left their lips, but then I felt as if I was hearing it just after they  said it. I was enveloped in a battle between the past, present and future. I felt like spinning.", "Once we arrived at our mid-point hotel, I was in the midst of the most glorious trip. I had also become obsessed with the foreign nature of my toes and the skin that covered them. I could not stop examining them in my clear plastic sandals. Later, after the most intense bites of salad and sips of coke at dinner, I acquired the most wonderful feeling. I, in about 10 seconds, figured out everything. I discovered the language that human should be speaking. It was the most perfect laguage. It was so perfect though, and it was all jetting through my bring so incredibly quickly, that I could not relay it to a single soul. My thoughts were not compatible with any known words. In this time, I had discovered how to obtain perfection in the world. I found the beauty in every single image that flashed through my mind. I realized the perfection in all life, which is normally viewed as just the opposite. I was so sure that I would be able to tell people of the most wonderful language when I came down. Finally, 15 hours after I dropped the hits (yes, I said 15), I started to come down. I was able to force myself to sleep and try to remember everything I had learned that day. ", "Unfortunately, of course, when I woke up, the language and the perfection were gone. Every thought and insight that had seemed so intricate in the weaving of my existence had been pushed behind my consciousness. I could not retrieve it. Yet, from that day on, I have continued to find beauty in unexpected places, and people. That day is still regarded as home to one of the most significant experiences of my life. Hopefully, it will never all fade away, and I will be able to look back and remember something about that utter perfection that I saw for that short time, and the most beautiful sounds from the perfect language that ran through my head. I will always have a desire to go back to that point, and I wish that everyone could have experienced that with me. It was truly amazing, and I believe I will cherish it for the rest of my life.", "I went away from my job in Pittsburgh for the weekend of July 4th.  I met up with some travelers at the Pittsburgh Intern'tl Airport and we drove up to Ridgeway Pa in a rental car.  I was there for the weekend, and while camping down in the Bear Creek valley I heard that somebody was throwing a rave up in the main 'Owl's Nest' parking lot.  I chose not to go.  The night of July 4th I was walking with a good friend i hadn't seen in a long time.  He had been a soldier for the US army until he got kicked out for smoking pot.  ", "Anyway, he convinced me to go up to the rave that night in the parking lot.  He and I walked up to the A-camp that was nearby to get a ride to the main parking lot about 2 miles away.  I bought 2 hits for blotter from an older hipped out brother and gave one to my friend.  We were speculating about the authenticity of the stuff i'd just bought when some dude and his passenger asked us if we wanted a ride. We hopped right in and drove off for the parking lot where the rave was.  ", "We were crusing along with some strangers who were probably already tripped out, and here there was some other guy walking along the road.  The driver stopped and asked the guy if he wanted a ride.  So this other dude with a bookbag gets in the back seat with us.  He was rather 'studious' looking.  He was wearing glasses and had a button down shirt with a collar.  After we had went along a bit he asked the driver if he wanted any 'dose'.  The driver and his passenger declined.  My friend Hayden and i looked at each other and i then asked if we could have some.", "This dude pulls out a chemistry lab storage bottle with a dropper at the top of it.  This bottle was brown glass and probably about 1000mL.  He says 'This is the washout from the basins that they use to make LSD.  Some elders gave it to me and told me to pass it on.'  ", "My friend and i thinking it was diluted each took about 2 droppers full of the liquid.  I distinctly remember swishing the liquid around in my mouth. ", "So hayden and i were dropped off at the parking lot, and i began to feel the effects of the L starting to kick in.  We found out that we had quite a way to go to get to the party.    Hayden walked off and i sat down beside someone's dark green Vw bus.  I enjoyed laying there and i felt it's personality communing with me.  ", "I got up and went to walk down the road to the rave.  The effests were coming on strong now.  A group was a little bit ahead of me and someone had some glowsticks on a string spinning them around.  I kept thinking that they had lightsabers.  I caught up to the group, and i could hear a girl breathing across the road from me.  I moved closer to her. I felt that i needed to protect her.  I was her bodyguard.  I had no idea who she was.  I asked her name and she told me it was Amy.  ", "We walked further down the road.  Where was Hayden?  The moon was full, the silver light casting everything in a spacey glow. What a wonderful time i was going to have!!", "I was a little scared form time to time, but the fear faded quickly.  The thing i was most concerned about was becoming confused and disoriented.", "The group i was walking with finally got to the rave.  There at the entrance to the litle space off the road was Hayden.  I hugged him and he laughed.  He kept poking me to see if i was really there.  He said something to me about being naked, so i walked over behind the setup.  There was a u-haul and a gasoline generator with a tent canopy set up for the DJ booth.  I walked behind there and took off my clothes.  That's when the thoughts invaded.", "Hayden had been in the Army.  He had been in communications. He had somehow taken contol of a government communications satelite. Here he was playing techno music on the world communication network!!!  He was the DJ!!!  I was running around naked yelling at the people over at the DJ booth to leave him alone.  ", "Then i thought that I was in the making of the next Star Wars... Episode II.  Frank Oz the voice of Yoda had died, and i was the only one who could talk like Yoda. I was running around talking like Yoda.  I thought my friends Laurie and Melissa were there.  I remember talking to a girl who i thought was Laurie.  That's when the corporations too over.", "Since hayden had stolen the satelite, the top companies of the world wanted to restore peace.  An asian girl sat near me and mentioned somethign about Ford.  She was the daughter of the top Ford exec!!!  For some reason she got mad and went to walk away.  I tried to get her to stay there.  So i followed her to the entrance.  And there was Hayden!", "He talked to me for a little bit and i asked him to help me find my clothes.  after a while he looked down at me and exclaimed 'You don't have any clothes!!!'  'I know!!! Help me find them, they're lost!!!!'", "I did find my shoes, and i walked back out to the dirt roadway.  I was looking at the moon, and i kept seeing a laser beam shoot across my vision ala Dark Side of the Moon.  So i walked off in the direstion i thought leaded back to the main parking lot.  I was walking over near the edge of the road, and i entered the woods.  I was feeling kinda funny.  I stumbled into the brush, and i remember crashing over and falling down.  I was dying.", "My mind drifted off into a Tolkien book.  I could see the words written in that elegant text.  I was part of the earth and my body melted (rotted?) away and for a thousand years i was a hillside.  Then water and wind pushed away the dirt and i was flat again.  It was like i was reliving that part of the earth's memory.  ", "I became concious lying on my back staring up at the stars through the canopy of leaves.  I had the feeling i was lying in a net.  Some people were talking to me.  This was a test.  I was being trained for the special underground organization that Hayden belonged to.  I was held in a net and i felt my mind drift away.  I became a two dimensional object.  I was a 'downward spiral'.  I was spinning and spinning and drifting downwards.  Images came to my mind of two seperate entities.  A goat an a dove were pulling in opposite directions.  I had a message sent into my brain.  ", "'There is no greater wrong than a child torn between the parents of two different religions'", "I spiraled off some more and i became the film of oil on a stagnant stream, and i looked up to see a dragonfly land above me.  It's compound eye glittered in the sunlight.  I then became one of the facets of the eye.  The words of Albert Einstein entered my mind.  'I just want to know the thoughts of God. Everything else is just details.'  I saw Einstein as he arrived in heaven. He asked God what the answer to life was, and God said 'YES'.  As i became coherent i thought that God had let me travel back through time and space.  I had been allowed to go back to 1978.  I was allowed to travel to San fransisco, California in that year.", "I got up and broke free from my 'net'.  As I walked out of the woods i thought i could surf.  I ran down the road as fast as i could, and i stopped a guy standing beside the road.  'What year is it?'  He looked at me kinda funny and answered '1999, dude'", "So i tried to find my clotes again, but no dice.  At least i had my shoes.  Now, if i could only find which way i was supposed to go.  I walked for a bit and ran into a 'DEP' officer.  I walked over to him and asked him how to get to get to the parking lot. He issued me a ticket.  I didn't have any pockets, so i slipped it in the window of a parked car along the road.  I kept walking, and if i saw a car approach, i would hide in the woods.  I stopped by another car along the road, and i asked a guy that was camping there  for a pair of pants i could wear.  He hooked me up with some pajamas pants.", "I finally made it to the parking lot after an eternity of walking.  I had lost Hayden, but i knew i'd see him again. I went over to the rental car i had come up in, and layed on the back window.  I looked up at the stars, and i saw the milky way smeared across the darkness. I fell asleep glad to be out of the whole mess.  Someone nearby was playing some Grateful Dead on a car stereo, and i fell asleep to Jerry's guitar.  ", "I woke up a little later and i was freezing.  I got up and walked around.  Two cars over someone had left their window down.  I looked inside and decided that they wouldn't mind if i slept for a little bit inside.  I opened the door and crashed out again on their back seat.

My setting was a music festival in California.  I thought I was injesting 10-20 hits of good liquid LSD.  I find out later I got a 'Chunk' in the last of the bottle.  A tiny little Crystal of LSD.", "I really don't think I was in the appropriate setting for this type of extensive interfacing but there I was.  In the Moment.  Past Present and Future lined up into one and created a lattice work of moving eternity so I jumped on.  I went through many synchronicities lining up people in my life events coming into place.  At one point in the reality I was in I Birthed universes for the future or past or the infinte.  Time has a funny way of bending and contorting in this altered state.  ", "The birthing process brought me closer to oneness.  I had a hard time re-entering my body.  Everything turned to ones and zero's and negitive one like on the internet.  I actually felt like The planet had a big net over it and to re-enter I had to go through it.  Very unpleasent in a digital way.  The most interesting thing happened to me after this experience.  My eye color changed for three days.  I have green eyes and after this experience I had bright piercing electric blue eyes.  People around me were commenting as well as my boyfriend.", "I have made an explanation to my self about this.  How scientifically sound it is I don't know.  I know lighter eyes let more light in them.  So on my journey I believe I interfaced so much with so much light(truth) that my eye color adapted to that frequency of learning on that level.  As far as set and setting, the universes I birthed there was me pissing my self here, I ended up hanging out with rock med.  I would not trade my experience for ANYTHING.  I also woundn't take such a high dosage of any thing in a festival setting with out someplace to go where you can let it all out if need be.  It is important to have acess to a space on this demension that can haddle your body mimicking what is going on in other demensions you may be traveling. I use this and all other alternative reality experiences every day to further the study of self.

This memorial day weekend I attended MINDSTATES2.", "In 1964 my mother, a devout religious person, died of a debilitating disease. She had raised me in her religion, but on her passing I was stripped of all faith. If there was a God, how could he have deprived me, and the rest of the world, of the benefit of the most angelic person I have ever encountered? I was bitter and confused, and stayed that way until 1967. Then, on leave from military duty and visiting a friend in California, I had occasion to try LSD for the first time. I knew about Timothy Leary's experimentations, and the term 'religious experience' had loomed in my mind for some time. I was in need of a sort of restoral of faith, needed to know that there is some reason and rhyme to life. ", "I was given a tablet to swallow by my friend, and sat back against a pillow to wait for the onset of I knew not what. Ravi Shankar's sitar music flowed from the stereo, the room was decorated with tapestries and oriental rugs, mellow lighting made the room warm and comfortable, and incense burned in a wooden holder. My friend and I were dressed comfortably in Indian gauze shirts and loose bell-bottoms and talked softly of times we had shared and things that we'd experienced since we'd been apart. Conversation eventually dissipated into a peaceful silence. As I sat there the room slowly faded from my vision, being replaced by visual memories of the day. Then I was remembering the day before, and the day before that, and every day of my life in vivid brilliance. Memories were not cluttered by experience. On the contrary, they were exact experiences of the original occurences. Emotions were repeated and the sensorial memories were in full detail. I relived every day of my life in reverse order. ", "The sorrow of Mom's passing was replaced by the joy of her presence in life. I once more felt her gentle caress in my hair, heard her soft words of encouragement. I remembered being a small boy with a skinned knee whose pain dissolved with a kiss to 'make it all better.' I remembered her holding me in her arms and pointing out dewdrops on rose petals in the sunshine of a morning in 1947, the year I was born. I remembered the shock of coming into a world of cold and noise at birth. I remembered the pink and purple abstract swirls of light filtering through her flesh as I floated inside her, and the undecipherable sounds of softness and harshness that had been her and my father talking. I remembered the awareness of being. I remembered a little 'ding,' the sound of a chime, and a spark of light that was my transference to physicality. I remembered being free in the universe, stars and all of space around me, and I had the capability of being anywhere or everywhere all at the same time. ", "I picked a star and focused on it, and found myself approaching it. You've all seen Star Trek's introductory scene. I don't believe the show was out yet, at least I'd never seen it. That star loomed larger the closer I got to it, and it dawned on me that I may crash into it. But somehow I knew that was the ultimate point, and with that, actually entered the star. I found myself in a place of pure light, a place where all power was centered and all souls were one. I was a creature of light, sharing light and love and power with all the universe. I was an individual part of the all, as a drop of water in the ocean. I was home. I knew that I was a part of the universal energy, love, and power. I had found God and knew that we all, and everything that is, are one. It is said that God is everywhere and in everything. Yes, I am. Yes, we are. Yes, all is. We are tendrils of light intertwining to gather pure experience for that to which we are all tethered, and so the universe is in constant expansion. Profound revelation! The first of many to follow. ", "The room faded back into my vision, and I was cleansed and illuminated. My friend didn't understand all I tried to relate to him, but did listen intently and tried to fathom where I had been. We both slowly came down, munching on grapes and cheese. I had found the religion that I needed. I continued to take the sacrament (LSD) into the early nineties, and continued to have the cosmic experience, much more than distorted reality, the truly transcendental trip, until I had explored all the dimensionality of the universe. My last trip took me beyond seeing the galaxies merge into cosmic beings, to the point where all creation merged into a little pinpoint of light in the void. I realized that if I went further than that, I would lose sight of creation and be lost in the void. That's okay, if you want to be a lone God and create a new universe, but, hey, I got a life here. And a Purpose. You. I now live a serene life, have taught my children well, and cherish my faith and my memories. Maybe one more time, when I'm ready to check out of this hotel. I want to enjoy my grandchildren a while longer.", "It was anticipated to be the best party (rave) in a long time and the set and setting couldn't have been better, so I decided that this was the night I would trip for the first time (I had actually taken acid a month or so earlier but nothing happened more than a very slight body fry, very disappointed).  I also decided that I would do 2 hits this time to make sure I would actually trip - BAD idea (just a hint - never do 2 your first time!).", "So within 30 to 45 minutes I was starting to feel quite energetic and everything was extremely funny - I was basically running around telling my friends I was crazy and insane, just because it was fun to say, and I was laughing my ass off at my friend A. as she did old 80's dances.  I went into the bathroom and my face stretched up and down in the mirror, I looked at the floor and I laughed in amazement as the tile swirled and shifted.  I came out and found my friend B, he said that 'metro is here' but to 'not worry about it, they're just making sure everything's OK.'  I thought little of this and proceeded to watch glowsticks, dance, laugh at funny shit, and basically have a great time.  Until the lights turned on.", "(Mind you I took the acid at 10:30pm, it was now probably about 11:30)  At first I wasn't really bothered by the lights being on.  Cops were shutting it down (venue wasn't licensed, gee great).  I was in such a good mood and I knew I could keep my cool, thinking that as I stood right next to a cop.  But soon everything turned to confusion, everyone had to exit the building through a narrow hallway that seemed long as hell.  Everything in my trip at that point turned 'ghetto' as people started chanting 'fuck the police' and I began to get increasingly anxious and paranoid.  Peoples faces stretched and distorted and their eyes looked sunk in.  ", "Once outside I couldn't keep track of any of my friends if they were more than 10 feet away from me.  Extremely confused, halfway lost, and just trying to keep calm, A. walked me to my car and had me wait as she went to find a driver.  At this point I think is where I peaked, right before the cop came up to me, telling everyone to move out and go home. ", "Before I knew it the cop was asking me who's car it was, (I said mine) asked if I could drive, (stupid me, I said no) then the horror started as he began asking what I took, if it was GHB, Ecstasy, LSD, asking if I 'wanted to go to jail tonight,' etc.  Everytime he asked, he made me look at him to answer, and everytime I looked it scared the shit out of me as his face morphed and stretched with an authoritative evil.  I knew he could tell I was lying, seeing how I kept looking away.  I scanned the parking lot as best I could for my friend A. who came up just in time and said told the cop that I had gotten 'dosed.'  I said yeah I drank some water that I had been dosed or something of that matter.", "After what seemed like hours the cop believed that I had been dosed with some kind of drug involuntarily, took my pulse, which he said was around 140-160 bpm (because I was so intensely scared) and escorted me to sit me down by the ambulance.  The next 15 minutes I sat scared as hell asking for water, not being able to understand anything, still thinking I was in deep shit and my I was going to jail and my dreams and goals would never be reached.  I was so afraid I felt like crying (and I hardly ever cry) but I couldn't feel anything, no emotions, just fear and confusion.  They found me a cell-phone to use, I tried calling my friend V., she wasn't home.  Nobody was home.  Hell I even tried calling my dad and he would've been pissed, because all I wanted to do was go home where it was safe.", "The rest of the trip was pretty much driving around all night in a passenger seat trying to locate other friends around town; it took me a good 2 or 3 hours for me to actually calm down once the cops let me go, I kept thinking that I was going to get caught if we got pulled over.", "What I learned from this is to FUCKING MAKE SURE your setting is safe before doing any kind of drug, and to make sure you can handle it (and not to mention don't drive your own car to the party).  I wasn't ready for what happened that night and I don't think I could go through it again.  I'm eternally grateful to my friend A. for 'saving' me because had she not been there and had not come up at the right time with the right thing to say, I would've gotten hauled off and my future would be seriously fucked.", "As a person prone to extreme behaviors and depressed states, it was a bad idea for me to expirement with LSD.  Nevertheless, having grown bored with Marijauna after 2 or 3 months, the only other drugs available were acid and heavier substances such as cocaine and opium which I had no interest in.  2 years later, I have come to decide that LSD is in some ways one of the strongest substances available, but at the time I was unaware.  I had done acid a few times prior to the one I am about to describe, but only at very low, purely 'recreational' doses.", "Set and setting are key, and so by dropping acid before class, I was setting myself up to fail in many ways, but I did not know any of this at the time.  I swallowed 3 'hits' of acid about 4 hours before I had to go back home.  ABout 40 minutes later, I became aware of a sensation of reality 'swimming' around me.  Anywhere that I looked, the walls would buckle and breathe, swelling and bulging, and any surface that I observed that was broken into small pieces (IE, carpets, TV static, gravel, etc.) were textured with pictures, images straight from my subconcious, almost exclusivly faces.  ", "My whole body felt alive in a way that I had not before expirenced.  I had an extremely diffacult time keeping exactly what I was supposed to be doing in focus, and I became convinced that I had done something horribly wrong.  I then became aware of 3 levels of error:  peers, family, and the law.  I was totally convinced that everyone around me must know that I was tripping, and hiding this fact became my primary goal.  Everyone who passed me seemed to be looking at me, looking down on me.  At this point the visual and audial distortions were no longer 'fun' or 'interesting'; the psychological barrier that let me keep everything in focus was gone and I just wanted to come down.  Somehow, I managed to get home, (although someone had to remind me which stop to get off at: the visual stimulus of traveling in a vehicle at 35MPH was too much and I went into some kind of trance state that I barely remember) and I remember feeling like I was going to vomit.  I didn't though, and I went into my house and lay on my bed, closed my eyes but instead of seeing the normal blotchy-black, I saw brillent geometeric patterns that cascaded and grew until I saw a sheet or pure blinding white, and on some level I realized the drug's effects had reached their peak.  ", "I ran outside, blinding into the woods, and felt that I was the One and Only:  all external stimulus was being interpreted as a manifestation of internal forces:  it wasn't that I was at one with the universe, I WAS the universe.  This was a terrifying proposition which faded almost immediately, and then I realized I was just a player in the game of life, a game that I suddenly decided was very much worth playing, and I became convinced I had forfeited, that I was going to die.  This also faded, and then I was aware that I was me, and that I had taken LSD, and that this was a terrible thing that I was going to be punished for.  I started to come up with excuses, ways I could fool the authorities, and then I went insider and collapsed in shame.  For some reason I called my mother and told her that I was on LSD.... my parents were products of the 60's, and she knew how to deal with the situation, made me realize that it was just a drug and that it was going to wear off.", "Nevertheless, it was a harrowing, unpleasent expirence.  It was mind-blowing enough that I saw the creative, constructive, enlightening potential of the drug, but it had none of these effects on me.  All in all, I would say that LSD can be wonderful (this was neither my first nor my last expirence with it, only the most intense) but it was not for me.  As anyone who knows anything about psychadelics would also say, if you're going to trip, make sure the setting is appropriate, have a clear mind beforehand as any residual negative emotions are likely to be intensified, and never trip alone.", "It's about time I wrote about acid. For the past two years for me, its been shrooms and MDMA, nothing else. But before that, for four years, I consumed about three to four hundred individual doses of LSD. The funny thing was I didn't do it every day, only on a Friday or a Saturday night. It had to be one of these nights so I could disappear all the next day without missing out on any responsibilities. The first time I dosed I was twelve years old. A little young, but I didn't really understand it anyways, and didn't do it again until freshman year of high school.", "Every weekend me and a lot of my friends would take very high doses and do things that took balls. It was like a rite of passage for the mind. We would all sit in a circle and talk about the nastiest, most horrible things that went on inside our heads, and it was a release. Every weekend helped us to deal with the things we had to do each week. After four years of being in that circle of friends, I found that acid had lost its effect on me. I was becoming immune. I relaxed and just smoked good pot for a year, and decided to start again with a very high dose. Me and one friend took about seventeen large blotter hits each and sat in his house for a day and night. This was a tremendous experience, seeing as how I hadn't even really thought about LSD for an entire year, and suddenly here I was, floating in the mental spectrum of reality, trodding along with my pal, saving him from the demons that ran his head, and showing him the way of the dragon.", "Most everyone's consciousness resides in the third dimension, some even in the second. Well, this night I pulled my stubborn manic-depressive friend up to the fourth. He was amazed. I told him to imagine what it was like on the fifth, and that would mean you're on your way to the mastery of the soul. I grinned at him and right there he knew that our entire trip was a lesson for him, coming from my more advanced true self. I continued to take LSD for another year, sparsely and only when it served a spiritual purpose. I now regularly see my guardian angels, or simpler guardian spirits, even when I'm completely sober and focused. But all the LSD I've done and all the expansive spiritual voyages within have heightened my already half-open third eye (I am one of the very first indigo children). I hope my personal history with LSD will help others of similar spiritual mind.", "Wow.  Wow.  Very crazy, yes.  The expectations were nothing, the hope was small, the reality to come was a big surprise...", "Upon certain times in a person's life, the nature around you takes you in.  It envelopes you.  It calls to you.  Yesterday was one such day.  Nature's display of weather was unignorable.  The rains to be called down in summertime...and then I recieved a note from a friend with a graphic that truly captivated and inspired me.  Let it be, children - let them play.  I felt the call, it was strong.", "To pursure the faint hopes of minimal expectations, while knowing all the while that we're prepared for an exercise in futility, we went through the motions.  The empty bottle lay where it was put to rest after the last episode.  It was there that I found it.  Two swallows of water into the container, followed by a swirl and shake, and off with the top.  Again, the expectations were that this would most likely be an exercise in futility, but the hope was there.  The bottle was emptied into a glass and I drank one swallow, Rob drank one swallow.  Then nothing.", "'This is a worknight for me.' - I expected to perhaps 'feel' something, or maybe see the stains of motion that the eyes allow.  I thought we would have to 'try' and focus to 'gain' anything.  To the contrary, there was nothing you could focus on that wasn't 'gaining' on you.  Less than one hour after the sip, the squares on the ceiling came together and tore apart, furiously.  The water that had rained from the heavens took on it's life, and danced.  Everything was broken up, and together.", "What I expected to be little bike ride through the park became a rollercoaster through the planets.  This was a worknight, again.  Extremely intense, way too much for a worknight.  Alas, I was in for a ride, and held on tight.", "The Simpsons carried us into a candyland maze of colors and cartoons, and inspired us to create a cartoon of our own, so we did.  I had these glowsticks in my car, which I retrieved.  There was two greens, a blue, and a red.  Oh yeah.  Lisa had just finished mopping the kitchen floor and cleaning everything...", "And we got the scissors out.  The glowsticks were parted by a single cut, and exposed.  To hold on in your hand above your head like the statue of liberty, only to allow your arm to swing violently, releasing the glowing substance to land on and light up every inanimate object, only to animate it.  Rob danced under the rain of color, and it stained him - his hat, his shirt, everything.  Yes - 'let your children play'.  Let them sing, let them dance, let them REJOICE!  And so it was, the entire room glowed.  Brilliant red, green, blue stars everywhere.  The ceiling, the kitchen, the carpet, the walls, the furniture - and Rob...", "So there we stand, hovering over a maze of colors and stars like Gods looking down upon a universe.  And it was the universe, indeed.  We would hover over a particular galaxy, and them shoot to the floor to investigate a particular cluster of stars.  The stars would then become everything - clowns, faces, shaped, a fantastic kaleidescopic array of patterns, vibrant with glowing color.  And the lights are off the whole time...", "Needless to say, in REALITY - Lisa was not too pleased.  But the children want to play, none the less.  Let your children play.  And we did.  DRIVER 2 is a video game where we crash cars into each other, and crash we did.  A burst of laugher not much different than that of young schoolgirls rang out every two minutes from the astronauts.  They were bliss, and watched, as everything turned and twisted, through the night.", "And then it was 2:00AM.  The walls told the tale that this was not over, not by a longshot.  I gaged the depth of my journey directly by the speed at which the walls allowed themselves to liquify and allow gravity to take hold of them, their appearance, their structure.  And melting at a rate of 12 inches per 5 seconds was an indicator of where, in time and space, we were.  It was time for the plants to try and bring me home.", "And so we began to build clouds inside the house.  We knew that these clouds would be the only hope of bringing the astronauts closer to the earth, as well as allowing a proper decent, without incineration upon entry into the atmosphere.", "And success it was.  Apollo 13 landed, and two sailors are left at sea, swimming.  And so I laid my head to rest, still swimming, hoping that throughout the night, we would find shoreline.  God bless the shoreline, huh?  Well, in the middle of the night, the swimmers did, finally, swim to shore.  With both feet on the ground - I awoke.  It was 7:15AM.  Rob lay on the couch, eyes closed.  I'm sure he made it to shore, too.  After all, it was quite clear early in the night that I had traveled a LOT further than he.", "I closed my eyes again, and Lisa drove to work.  I opened my eyes, sat down, and began to type.", "And I type now.  This is my story, this was my dance.  The children's soft minds were soaked, and dried.  As I look around me today, I feel a greater distance between my fellow man and myself than ever before.  My coworkers - they are in place in this universe much different than I.  I am further from humanity, and closer to God, or so that is the word I choose to use because it encompasses NATURE, the STARS, and the 5th dimension.  People are funny, yes they are.  I feel so detached from common man, and closer to the wonders of the world - it's unbelievable.  To play...yes, to play.", "There's something different about us, different from the common man.  No, sir.  You are uncommon in such common land.", "'Having read _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ numerous times, and given that I was planning a trip to Vegas to meet some old college buddies for a weekend, I decided that I'd try a hit before boarding the plane. Having only done this 2 previous times, there was a bit of nervousness. Many thoughts of losing it and running rampant through the plane with drool spilling from my lips were streaming through my mind, but I decided that it would be worth the effort. It was. I'd highly recommend this, especially if you are an experienced intrepid traveller. I had no problems on the plane. Was over whelmed with the flight, the earth below, and the sunset that I got to experience on the flight into LV.", "It began with a glorious flight down the Oregon and California coast. The teeny-tiny patterns in the ocean waves were trigger enough for many a visual explosion. Highly intellectual journey as well. I was reading some book on philosophy at the time and was blown away. Landed in San Jose and actually had to have the wits about myself to switch planes. All went well. It was tough at times to keep from breaking out in uncontrollable laughter, but eventually was seated on the window again for the final leg of my journey. The desert and the mountains were just gorgeous from 30,000 feet, and the sunset was indescribable, not to mention the vision of the strip as we circled around to land. The rest of the evening was a really good time, but the flight in was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. I'm damn glad I did it.'", "Back in the 70's I did acid a few times, but in the ten years since then I had no access to the stuff, nor was I particularly interested because of other pursuits. Recently I have been studying cognitive and neural systems, which has revived my interest in issues of consciousness and perception. I was delighted therefore when a friend offered to share two last hits he had saved in the freezer from the days of his own wild youth. I had vague recollections from ten years ago of weird sensations and hallucinations and I prepared for the 'experiment' with a checklist of questions to myself about my experiences. The questions were in the nature of 'How does the visual world look?' 'How do you experience sounds?' 'can you compute 345/15?' and the like. I looked forward to the experience with great interest and curiosity.", "We went to my place that night and made ourselves comfortable, and when things started turning weird, I pulled out my checklist. First of all, the notion of having a checklist seemed at the time to be so hilariously funny that my friend and I were doubled up with laughter for a long long time before I could get to any of the questions seriously. It was a kind of laughter that I havent experienced since childhood, a deep and overwhelming mirth that shook my whole body to the core and tears were streaming down our cheeks as we gasped happily for breath. Each new question occasioned a renewed outburst of helpless laughter until we were thoroughly exhausted.", "When I finally got aroud to the questions I discovered a fact that leaves me astounded to this day. I answered every one of the perceptual questions exactly as I would have while stone cold sober. The reason why this was so surprising was that I was actually feeling very very different. In fact I was feeling exceeding peculiar. In fact words cannot express how strange I was feeling, and yet, my sensations of the world around me were exactly as they are normally. So, I asked myself, what is it that is actually different? Well, the sights and sounds and smells were the same. It was my perception of them that was different. This experience gave me a new appreciation for the word perception. Normally we think that if we observe an object, a pencil in your hand for instance, we see exactly that, a pencil, the real pencil, and nothing but the pencil. It came to me that that is not the case. Even when regarding as matter-of-factual an object as a common everyday pencil, we perceive it through a filter of our own perspective, our own view of things. This perspective is normally so ordinary and unremarkable that we are not even aware of it, but it was exactly this perspective, our view of the world around us, that is altered by the drug. It brought my attention to something that I had been totally unaware of although it has been in front of me all my life.", "It is somewhat like the experience of intently watching some event unfold before your eyes, and suddenly becoming aware of the fact that you are watching it on television. Shifting your attention from the event itself to the glowing phosphor dots on the screen. You are looking at the same thing, and you are seeing the same thing, but your perception of it has altered radically. Well the same thing was happening to my own senses. Suddenly I was aware of the fact that the world around me is not the real physical world, but only a view of the world as it impinges on my senses. That the image of the pencil is not a pencil, but a pattern of neural activity in my visual cortex. Of course this is no new scientific revelation, I knew that all along. But now I could feel it, I could perceive it in a way that has permanently altered my way of thinking about consciousness.", "We went outside for a little walk in the night air, and while walking down the street I got a repeat of that first insight. I had the feeling that instead walking down a real street, I felt as if there was a big spherical screen all around me, with an image of the street projected onto it, and that as I walked the image changed, expanding out in front of me and collapsing back down again behind me. I could look up and see an image of the sky, look down and see my feet pushing the sidewalk backwards. I was stationary, it was the image of the street that was moving. Of course when you think about it, this perceptual 'distortion' is actually more real than the 'normal' perception. My brain, comfortably enthroned in my skull feels nothing of the outside world except through the pattern of activity it receives from the senses. It receives images, sounds, sensations, and pastes each one in its proper place on a sensory sphere that represents the world around me. My perceptual distortion was that instead of seeing the outside world, I was now seeing this sensory sphere, with a sensory image of the world on it. To me this an extremely interesting and exciting insight that I will remember for the rest of my life.", "I would see strangers approach along the sidewalk, at first appearing as a little insignificant dot near the expanding focus of my sphere. They would grow and grow until I could see them in great detail before they passed behind and shrank back down to nothing. It was as if each of us posessed his own sensory sphere, and as we approached the spheres would intersect, and I would appear in his sensory world as he appeared in mine. We played a little ritualistic game as we passed, each in turn taking a good look at the other, then politely averting their eyes to allow the other to return the visual examination without making direct eye contact, before hurrying on down the street. It brought to mind an image of dogs presenting themselves in turn for the other to get a good sniff.", "We stopped at MacDonalds to get a bite to eat, and never did a big mac taste so good, although it seemed to take an hour to consume it, and I was a little concerned that the other customers might notice the enormous effort I was expending in getting it down. I could feel my tongue and cheeks maneuvering the lumps of food into position on my molars, a few good chomps, then it was pushed down the chute where my esophagus began an elaborate sequence of peristaltic contractions to persuade it down to my stomach. I looked up at my friend between mouthfuls, and his face looked so weird, it is hard to describe. Although visually he looked exactly as he always does, I would become aware of individual components of his face, his nose, his cheek, his eyes, which would trigger a strong response to my senses independant of the rest of the face, so that the impression was somewhat like a cubist painting.", "We attempted a few mathematical exercises and found that although we were fundamentally capable, it was difficult to remember which part of the problem you were working on, or to hold interim results in your head. While walking around town I had found it extremely challenging to navigate around the familiar streets of my neighborhood for a similar reason; although I could plan a course, I had some trouble remembering which part of the course we were actually on. We were never in danger of actually getting lost, but we did spend some time discussing where we were and how to proceed. It was a wonderful sensation like exploring a fabled town that you have read about but have never actually visited before. As the hours rolled on by we spent the time playing with a slinky and one of those electrostatic lightning machines, blissfully absorbed in such simple pursuits like two children playing with toys. Our conversation disintegrated to short meaningless sentences. I would say something like 'The quality of light is an etherial essence' to which he might respond 'But the meaning of existance is not comprehensive' and I would reply 'Yes but it is if you want it to be', and it would go on like this, knowing that he had no idea of what I had meant, which didn't matter at all, since I didn't know myself what I had meant. Often we would just break into paroxisms of mirth, laughing and laughing until our stomachs hurt and the tears flowed in rivers down our cheeks. At one point I noticed a luminescent glow on the slinky that I could not account for. I told him breathlessly of my discovery, thinking it was a new form of mysterious energy, on a par with Newtons discovery of gravitation, and it took us at least ten minutes to discover that it was only the reflection of the lightning machine, which triggered another bout of helpless mirth.", "At one point we turned out the lights and looked at the patterns of light cast on the ceiling from the street. I cannot begin to express the deep beauty of those patches of light. I stared and stared with my eyes boggled out muttering 'oh my God! oh my God!' I swore I would never take patterns of light for granted again! I could see fantastically complex latticework patterns in the dark which became very vivid when I closed my eyes. I tried to describe these visions to my tape recorder because I knew I could never remember them in all their beauty and complexity, but the visions rushed by so fast and furiously that I could not begin to keep up with them, even if I could find words to describe them.", "Throughout these experiences I remembered an insight I had had ten years ago when I had last taken LSD. I remember thinking that although the experience is novel and fantastic beyond the wildest imagination, that there is also an element of familiarity to it all, a sense of deja vu, that at some past time I had seen these kinds of things before. After much thought it came to me. Remember when you were a kid, and could see patterns in clouds? I remember seeing things in every random pattern. In the linoleum of the bathroom floor there was a man's head, and a little girl, and a horse. In the trees across the street from the house I could see goofy and the snap crackle and pop characters. When I first learned numbers in school, 6 was a little fat boy with a big stomach, and 7 was tall and straight with creased pants, while 3 and 8 were little girls. Now they are just numbers to me, they have lost their fanciful connotations, but on LSD I see images again, like I did as a young boy. And near the end of the trip when thoughts and sensations become more 'fundamental' (how else can I word it?) and you feel spasms pulsing through your whole body and shaking you to your very foundations, it brings to mind the convulsions of a very young infant, and the boggled eyes with their expression of uncomprehending wonder and fascination. Is this the reason for the familiarity? Is this the way the world looked when I first cast eyes on it?", "If I were an alien intelligence come to visit the earth, to get a taste of life among these primitive semi-intelligent self-important pompous ape men, if I wanted to really know what it was like to be human, to have human thoughts and perceptions and I slipped into a human brain and viewed the earth through an earth mans eyes and ears and body, this is the way it would look. This is the wild distorted narrow visioned perspective on the world as seen from within a human mind, but seen with an alien detachment and objectivity. LSD gives me an opportunity to experience what being human is all about. To step back and see my world from a perspective that cannot be gained any other way. To gain deep insights into the nature of what I am. Should LSD be legal? Absolutely! Would I recommend it for just anyone? Absolutely not! I am an easy-going happy person, satisfied with my life, so the experience has always been a good one for me. But the psychedelic experience forces you to face up to some fundamental issues about your own life and mind, and if you are at all mentally unstable, unhappy with your life or yourself, if you have any unresolved mental conflicts, then the experience could well be disasterous beyond your most horrific nightmares! Anyone who takes this drug does so at their own risk, and it should never be taken lightly or pushed on people who arn't sure whether they want it. For those who are suited for it however the experience can be so rich and rewarding in a multitude of ways, that no man should have the right to deny it to them. It is a truely priceless experience!", "So then i took 12 hits of this purebred Octopus blotter, and after the usual leave the body white light communion and birth of the universe-genetic racial memory bit, i found myself (not to say that i had any concept of 'i,' 'my' or 'self') in an unfamiliar space. I was within a multi-dimensional web, somewhat akin to a sphere with a center everywhere and circumference nowhere, being turned in on itself an infinite number of times. The web was boundless in its permutations, copmposed of blue hexa-octa-and decahedral cells and not in linear time. ", "There were others, distinct, and i believe non-human entities; and they were mildly annoyed at my unannounced visit. They were rather busy, engeged in a game, The Game; i was a pawn, one of many in the 'stable' of an entity called 'Chako,' a '7th-level oversser.' The game took place on many levels, only one of which was our familiar, everyday consensus reality. Apparently, all beings vibrate at certain specific levels of psychic frequencies; by seriously tampering with mine through the ingestion of much dosage, I jumped temporarily to receiving 'level 4' data, and ended up in this 'overseer' domain. Chako 'told' me all this through convoluted yet clear thoughtforms, which i understood only partially, being limited in my wetware. ", "The object of the game, while ungrokkable to a level 1 entity such as myself, did not appear to be entirely benevelent. For that matter, Chako was not benevelent at all, and posessed of a rather demonic ambience. Anyhow, as Chako's pawn, i was to face another, someone else's pawn, but whether this other was human, when, where and on which plane was not made clear. At this point, the the effects of the lucidant were waning, and i was pulled out of the web, with no reluctance i must say. ", "Unlike many other trips where the revelations are fogotten shortly after emergence, I was left with distinct memories of the events that transpired and an almost engramatic warning of consequences of 'jumping' psychic levels. The strangest of all was the clarity of the name Chako and the concept of humans as psychic pawns in overseer's stables, playing The Game without a clue as to its purpose.", "This happened several years ago, it was neither my first nor my last high mikage experiment, but i have not been to the overseer domain since. Psychomemetics, hallucinogens, fantasticants - call them what you will, this was as real as anything i've experienced, mindset and setting irrelevant at this dosage. I await the encounter with the other, and i have no doubt i'll know when it comes. I hope i will be ready. ", "So, gentle people, have any of you ever had a like-minded journey? If so, did you figure out what the purpose of the Game is? I'd appreciate any comments, thoughts and ideas you may have on this matter.", "My next door nieghbor and i do a lot of acid but he was in charter during this time so he came home on pass. i went over to his house and we decided to get some acid. so i was looking all day but couldn't find any so i was gonna go to the store with this one crazy guy who buys me beer and he asked this guy if he had any weed he said no but he had acid. so i met up with him at his apartment complex and got 14 hits of acid. went back to my house and called my friend and he came over so we each ate 5 hits of mad hatter acid.", "i started to feel real fucked up really fast so i told my friend to go home and call me in a half an hour, because i felt like i couldn't even talk or move so when he did not call me in 2 hours i went up to his balcony and opened his window i thought i saw two people in there but i was trippin' hard so he jumps out of his window naked and pushed me! and i said what the hell are you doing and he kept on saying he was a pure ball of energy. so i said put some clothes on and lets go to the park, because we had this park in our nieghborhood we liked to trip in. but he didnt and just climbed down his balcony naked and started walking around. ", "then my other friend showed up to buy the reamaining 4 hits i had. and my friend tried to push him and he socked him but it didnt faze him. so he started walking down a main roud at like 3:30 am and i stayed in front of his house trying to think of what to do when i saw a cop car fly by so i went down to the corner and my friend got mased by a cop and when the cops asked me if i had any lsd tonight i said no and they shined the light in my eyes and still didnt know!!!!!!! but the cops face was just melting but i will never forget that night ......it's stuck in my mind.", "My first time frying was a chance experience.  A lot of my friends had tried acid, and always had good things to say about it.  I was at a pool hall where all the stoner people hung out at night, and my friend Brandy (who was one of the more experienced people, having spent a lot of time in Berkeley) bought 40 hits off a friend of ours, and was more than willing to share.", "I took one at about 8:00, and didn't feel anything a half hour later (although I've found with experience that this is total crap, I was told at the time it shouldn't take longer than that to kick in), so i asked for another one.  She gave me two.", "While waiting for it to kick in, my friend Bit and i were wrestling in a grass circle, and she pinned me down, and i looked at her face in front of the black sky, and her pupils seemed to dilate inward, like a cat, and her long teeth seemed to grow like vampire fangs.  At this point, i think the people who talk about their bad experiences would have freaked out.  But i was ready for anything, so i laughed, enjoyed it, and told everyone how cool it was.", "As it was coming on strong, i was feeling very hyper and happy, and i was sitting on a park bench (sort of) with my feet on the seat, and my head on the ground.  I was talking to my friend jeremy, and all of the sudden, his pupils blinked!  They were huge, of course, because by this time we all had the same dosage, and his eyes were suddenly completely hazel, and then all black again.  I took a double take, thinking about how wonderful it was, and went to talk to some of my other friends.  they were wondering around, staring at trees.  My friend cinnamon showed me a discovery that she called 'ganjaland', which was a group of trees that appeared to be huge pot trees.  it was beautiful.", "Many details of the night can be skipped here for the simple fact that they are unimportant, but i will say that we hooked up with a friend who had a car, crammed 8 people into a VW golf, and cruised to a few different places to get more Sid (at one point i took my fourth and final hit of the night) and some weed and some OJ and so on.  Then we retired to Buchanon Park at about 12:30 or 1:00.", "The park was beautiful.  The trees all swayed as if made of rubber, and it seemed like Buddha was waving hello at me.  Then one of the greatest experiences of my life occured.", "It was windy (as it always is in the bay area), and there were sprinklers wattering a small island of grass.  I became somewhat hypnotized by the water, and started walking into it.  As i came into the middle of the flying water, i could actually see the wind.  There are no words to describe the feeling of being able to see the wind.", "As a buddhist, I believe that i must have some good fuckin karma to have been witness to such a beautiful thing.  Throughout my entire first trip, there was never a time that i felt that i had lost control, or that it was too much.  I was not a buddhist at the time, but this experience was probably one of the biggest influences on my ability to believe that there is a spiritual world that we cannot normally see.", "For just six hours, i was in a completely different world.  i felt like i had been in a completely different dimension, and felt so much more alive having seen it.  ", "I've fried about 7 times since then, taken more and less, even had one bad trip (motel room?  friends with weapons?  sex (which causes guilt for me, cuz i want to be celibate)?  all this added up to the more terrible set and setting possible), but i've never had nearly that much fun on a trip.  it opened my eyes to a whole new world, and although i do not in any way condone the use of lsd for people who can't handle it, nor do i think it should be legal or easy to get, i will always love taking my twice-a-year trips to a whole new world.", "My future plans are to fry during the day for the first time, with hopes that it will open my eyes to more new great things, and that the lack of darkness and shadows will cut down on the paranoia i've felt every time except my first.  Acid is a connection to something we cannot understand or accept while sober, and for those of sound mind, an experience that cannot be substituted or replaced.  I'd recomend it to anyone who is honest with themselves.  I think that people who have problems with acid have too many skeletons in the closet.", "I'd been doing a lot of reading/research about drugs (this page was fantastic) and when a friend told me he'd recently tried acid I was very keen to experience it myself. The setting was my girlfriend's house, she was having a party, mostly our friends from uni.", "We took it around 7:30pm at another mates house before the party and arrived around an hour later. I sat down next to a couple of blokes and we were chatting for around half an hour and I felt a little anxious, wasn't sure if it was my anticipation or the drug itself. By this stage (90 mins later) I was beginning to wonder if we'd been ripped off, I stood up to go have a slash and.....hehehe the floor's bendy !! woah, my body feels all rubbery and distorted like I'm a plasticine man ! So I sit down on the toilet coz I'm not sure if I'm actually wobbling or not and I'm happy to find out I've still got control of myself ;) I'm looking at the walls and they're slowing bulging around like bubbles! I also have a charged feeling about my body.", "When I moved back outside I had to go tell my friend about what was happening and he nodded knowingly and we laughed about it together. It was now about 9:10pm. From then till around 11:30pm things got really intense and time passed very slowly. It seemed like the party had been going for AGES and was always expecting people to be leaving then I'd look at my watch and barely a few minutes had passed! (I strongly recommend wearing a watch or it may get very confusing!!) During the peak and this 'intensity' I found myself unable to focus on one thought for more than a second or two without extreme concentration. It wasn't all that unpleasant but on the verge of being overwhelming, it may have been easier in a less intense setting, say a few mates at my home rather than 40 odd friends crammed into a backyard. I walked out the front to be alone a couple of times during the night. It's very hard to describe with words what I mean by the intensity or to describe what it's like. It was sort of overwhelmed/intense/confusion even though not really unpleasant.", "During the peak, it was fun to play with hallucinations, not just visual distortions (there are many different sorts but I'm trying to keep it as brief as I can) but also things that aren't really there. I found I had almost total control over them and it was not scary because I was completely aware that it was just the acid causing it, and they only last for a maximum of a couple of seconds anyway before my brain works out what it really is. It tended to happen in semi-darkness or shadows where there was some ambiguity as to what I was really seeing and my brain was able to 'fill in the gaps' with whatever I chose to think about. For instance shadows on people's faces could make them evil or have coloured eyes or could imagine things in dark areas like shrubs.", "Another thing which amazed me was that no one seemed to be able to notice how spun out I felt. I felt talking to someone was a dead giveaway but to my amazement it just wasn't obvious from the outside. Communication was actually very hard because of the distractions of other thoughts flying around it was almost impossible to focus long enough to form sentences and then listen to a response! I also realised my speech wasn't very literal after several people kept asking me 'what I meant'.", "There was a sense of pity for drunks and even sober people and I wanted them to be on the same level to share with them and communicate with them. (We agreed not to tell anyone we were tripping until afterwards because I didn't want to feel like an experiment and wanted to experience it in a natural environment, which turned out to be a good choice I think)", "At around 11:30pm I began to feel the effects slowly wearing off. I noticed this not by clearer vision (coz it was still pretty weird!!) but the ability to devote more of my thought/concentration to my regular perception and it became easier to communicate again. Regular perception of time also began to return. During this stage I started to think about personal aspects of my life and the way I live according to my previous perceptions...I really don't know why!...at a party!? But I kept thinking about these things for a couple of days afterwards. I'd rather not discuss these things in detail, it's hard to understand myself anyway, but this part was my main motivation for wanting to repeat the experience, though probably in a different setting. There was also a feeling of contentness in returning to the normal state.", "As a young adolescent in the 1980s, I frequently experimented with all sorts of substances: Primarily marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, psilocybin and LSD. Most of my use was recreational in nature, but I also had a bit of the mystic in me. I was deeply intrigued by the writings of Carlos Castaneda, for whom certain hallucinogens were considered consciousness-expanding, a route to an alternative reality, or a higher plane of being, so to speak. I also read Herman Hesse and William Burroughs, for whom altered states of consciousness were also a frequent topic.", "In 1983, when I was 14 years old, I consumed a massive dosage of LSD while alone in my bedroom one night.  Unfortunately I had no idea of the strength of the dosage ahead of time, but with my subsequent experience I would estimate the dose at 800 micrograms or more. But I had no way of knowing this at the time, nor did I have ANY idea what was in store for me . I believed that I was just going to partake in another light, fun, amusement-park sort of trip as I had experienced with much weaker doses.", "It started out typically enough. If you've ever done a decent amount of LSD, you know how it goes. I sit around for an hour waiting for it to kick in, and then at some point I start to notice something different. My field of vision suddenly becomes very 'wavy'.  Everything starts undulating in the strangest way. Walls and ceilings appear to be alive, as they waver, fluctuate, and so on, almost as if they are breathing.  Moving objects leave 'trails' in the air. And yet, during the entire experience, my mind is relatively clear and normal. It isn't at all like being drunk, where I can literally feel my mind getting numb and my thoughts getting sloppy. Instead, my thoughts are as clear as a bell.", "Then serious close-eye visions started. This is hard to imagine until you've actually seen it. Imagine the most gorgeous stain glass window you have ever seen, and then multiply it by a million, both in terms of complexity and artistic intensity. There is no way to convey this experience with words: You literally see colors and geometric patterns you have never seen before. It is absolutely mind-blowing! It is staggering when it happened, because I simply had no idea this kind of stuff can come out of the brain simply because of the ingestion of an extremely small quantity of some chemical. ", "I was also listening to music at the time, and the most amazing thing happened: the music and my visual hallucinations began to meld into one single stimulus!  It is impossible to describe accurately with words, but I was literally seeing the sound!  It was as if the sound itself was alive and had inhabited my visual patterns, such that it had a life of its own. Think of the most complicated music you can (Mozart, Schoenberg, Phillip Glass and so on) and try to imagine what it would look like if it were expressed visually as a series of patterns and colors flowing through time. My visions took on the quality of a train moving through space and time, constantly shifting and evolving in complexity.", "What happened next is even more difficult to express with words, and I am forced to use a vague set of metaphors and adjectives which can do no justice. First, my inner field of vision became boundless. Think about how you normally see the outside world. Your eyes are almost like a camera; you see whatever is front of you, in whatever direction your eyes are pointed, and moreover you tend to focus on a single point in your field of vision. Your field of vision, while not completely two-dimensional, tends to look as such, like a movie-screen, but more complicated and detailed. ", "Our inner, imagined visions tend to reflect this outside field of vision; but there is no reason for this, the your inner eye has no boundaries. Try to imagine what it would be like if you could see not only in front of you, but also behind you, above you and below, all at the same time. And imagine that your vision was no longer focused on a single point, but rather, that you are 'taking in the view' from all angles at once.  It was as if I had become a eyeball which sees in all directions, without focusing in any one direction at all. This was my experience.", "Moreover, what I 'saw' was not the physical world around me, but rather the most beautiful light and color I could ever possible imagine in my wildest dreams, multiplied a million times over! However, to describe it as 'light and color' is entirely inadequate, because I was literally seeing colors I had never experienced before, and what I saw was intertwined with everything I heard, felt, and thought.", "At this point, time and space became a meaningless concept. It was not as if time had stopped or frozen, because things were still changing dynamically, or 'moving along' in some sense, and yet I did not have a feeling of time passing by. It was as if my world were both alive and yet all at once altogether timeless. Somehow it just 'existed' and 'lived', but without a clock ticking along.", "The other significant change was that the voice in my head stopped. Think about the way you go through life with that inner voice in your head.  It is a constant, never-ending narrative that I speak to myself in my waking mind.  If you've ever tried to silence that voice, you know how difficult that is. You try to make that voice stop talking, but inevitably, at some other level you begin talking to yourself about how your own mind is trying to stop the voice, and so on - it is very difficult to do this unless you have a lot of practice with meditation. (The only other time it happens is in sleep.)", "It was then that I began to become aware of the presence of God. This is by far the most difficult part to convey in words, but I will once again try to do so by using metaphors, simply to convey a psychic impression of this experience. ", "Imagine that you are an adolescent  who has lived alone in a completely enclosed room for your entire life. That is, try to imagine that you have lived all of your life alone in this one room, without every knowing that anybody else or any other world even exists. Then, imagine that all of a sudden that room opens up, and you are suddenly surrounded by thousands of other people just like yourself who have been watching you your entire life! Try to imagine how that would feel, living your entire life without ever realizing that there was anybody or anything outside of your little room -- and all of a sudden you discover that you are not alone, and that in fact, your little room has been surrounded by other beings like yourself, who have been observing you the entire time! Imagine that they would know everything about you, and think of how exposed you would feel, and yet at the same time, you would feel incredibly joyous, knowing that you are no longer alone!  And although those outside people have witnessed your deepest darkest sins, they simply do not care about them! All they want to do is embrace you, and free you from your little room, welcoming you into their glorious, all-knowing and all-loving community!!", "It is impossible to actually do so, but simply try to imagine how joyous and loved you would feel to actually meet these people for the first time, and to feel their warm embrace, their touch and their voices, their recognition and acknowledgment of your existence. Moreover, it is not like they are a bunch of strangers that you have never seen before.  It is much more like you are meeting up with an ancient clan of lost soul-mates who understand you perfectly, and of whom you have been aware at some deep subconscious level all your life, but about whom you had completely forgotten when you were born! ", "I must emphasize, however, that although I talk about these presences as a plurality, it was also as if they were a single unity as well.  They were many, but they were one. They saw with many eyes, but they thought with one mind.  They saw the world from many angles, but they felt the same feelings, and knew the same things, with perfect telepathy and communication beyond words. Again, it is highly paradoxical, and I think it's truly impossible to grasp unless you have witnessed it for yourself.", "What I then understood is that our normal, waking human reality is incredibly illusory. While the 'objective reality' is indeed real, our concrete perception of it is simply a highly limited, false reality which has become 'embedded' in our present frame of reference.  ", "In the middle of all this, I became intensely aware of something else. Again, words fail me here, but I felt as if I were on the 'threshold' of Heaven itself. I was aware that I had a choice:  If I so desired, I knew that I could 'die' right then and there.  I would simply step forward into this Heaven, perhaps never again return to my human reality. However, I somehow knew that I was 'not supposed to enter' Heaven just then.  I simply felt very strongly that I had an important purpose within my human existence, for which I was intended to return to the human world. And so I turned back.", "(Here I need to point at that I'm having to explain this in narrative form, as if these were experiences passing through time, but again, it somehow it all happened 'at once', and all of this awareness I am describing suddenly became immediately apparent to me, in a timeless sort of way, as described above.)", "And that was when I was ushered back not to my human existence, but to Hell itself. I immediately became completely overwhelmed with the sheer weight of timeless eternity, and the staggering vastness of infinity. While my ego had been allowed to dissolve beautifully on the threshold of death, now I began to struggle terribly to reconstruct my ego, to regain a foothold in my normal human existence. Just as my fleeting glimpse of Heaven was filled with undescribable joy, ecstasy and a timeless love, my subsequent experience in Hell was incredibly horrible and terrifying.", "Again, here is a metaphor I will use to describe it, however inadequately: Whereas I had previously felt like an adolescent discovering the crowd of soul-mates outside of his enclosed room for the first time, I now felt like I was being locked back into that cell for eternity! Try to imagine the feeling of being that adolescent who, after being shown the loving and warm world of God outside of his little room, is suddenly condemned to locked back in that room like a prisoner in a solitary cell, for all of eternity! I was consumed with loneliness, and I felt that I had previously opened a door which I should not have opened. I felt as if I had committed an unforgivable sin for which I was now condemned forever, as if I had eaten the fruit from the forbidden tree.", "Thus I was jolted out of my ecstatic state of mind, and suddenly became very aware of the physical world around me. I had a clock next to my bed, which superficially seemed to be ticking along normally, and yet every second that passed by seemed like a thousand years! Whereas time had previously become meaningless, all of a sudden it seemed to take on the force and momentum of a huge freight train crawling along at a rate of one inch per hour.", "And while I could see the physical world around me, I was still being surrounded by visuals, and I desperately wanted to stop them, but I couldn't. Whereas they had previously appeared as unimaginably beautiful, they now seemed haunting and torturous. It was like being stuck in the worst horror movie I could possibly imagine!", "If you have ever seen the movie 'Being John Malcovich', in which people are able to enter into the brain of Malcovich and experience his reality as if it were a movie of some sort, that is almost exactly how I felt in my own brain!  I could see my own physical reality as if it were a movie in front of my eyes, and yet I was deeply divorced from it. I was aware that it was all an illusion, and yet I felt that it was an illusion from which I would never escape.", "And whereas I had previously stopped the voice in my head completely, that voice now multiplied and took over again with a vengeance!  I felt like there were several of these insidious voices in my head and I could not control any of them!  It was very much like my inner voice was the engine of a car, and I was continually pressing the accelerator to the floor.  Just when I thought I had it under some semblance of control, it would take off like a shot, like an uncontrollable madman, as if my brain were possessed.", "At the same time, I became intensely aware of my physical body - Not only were my muscles full of cramps and aches, with my jaw aching terribly, but my insides literally felt like they were on fire.  I felt as if I had swallowed a gallon of sulfuric acid. The very pit of my stomach and my throat burned as if I had been stuck with a white hot poker. Moreover, I could feel every bowel movement, and the blood coursing through my veins, and it was driving me mad.  I repeatedly had to get up to go to the bathroom, and my feces and urine took on a detestable appearance, tinged with a sickening red.  I was convinced that I had been thoroughly poisoned.", "Moreover, I became dead convinced that I was stuck in this horrible state for eternity. I had more or less forgotten about the fact that I had ingested LSD.  I was convinced that I had become Adam, who had eaten the forbidden apple from the tree of knowledge and was now being banished from Heaven for Eternity.", "I simply cannot tell you the pain I endured for the next 5-6 hours, which quite literally seemed like eons of time, during which my hallucinations raged out of control and the voices in my head took over like a band of rioting madmen. I felt ineffably alone, cut off from all other life. And the worst part about it was that I was truly convinced that I had become separated from God and Heaven for all of Eternity....", "How I ever managed to gain a foothold on reality again (despite, the drug wearing off) I will never know. All I can remember is that I finally fell asleep after what seemed like forever, and when I woke up, I felt vaguely normal again, albeit with a brain full of cobwebs.", "After that experience, my life changed dramatically. For a long time, I swore off drugs of all kinds (including caffeine even).  I became a strict vegetarian, became highly interested in Buddhism, and actually shaved my head bald like a Buddhist monk for several years. I adopted the most stringent of ascetic regimes, refusing myself the most basic pleasures. I went months without sexual activity of any sort (not even masturbation), and practiced the strictest discipline I could possibly muster.", "After a number of years of this I eventually gravitated back to my carnal, human habits, but I never forgot what that experience was like.  And to this day, I am still searching for that purpose, that feeling of meaning and destiny which was conferred to me on the threshold of Heaven, that mission for which I know I am destined on this physical earth....", "For a while I had been wanting to trip because of all the stuff i heard about it. None of my friends liked tripping but i was not convinced. One a saturday night, my friend and i went to the Rocky Horror picture show, mainly because i wanted to sell some ecstacy i had. I ended up traded two rolls for a little baggie. In the baggie was supposevely acid. They looked like little purple insect legs. I do not remeber what they were called, but they said they were the cuttings left over from the sheet of gels or something. I was doubtful but trusting because it was my friend's boyfriend. We went out back and she put two of the bug-looking legs on my tongue. They tasted kinda strange. I let them dissolve and we went on with our night.", "About 40 minutes later we decided to walk to the graveyard, but halfway there we decided to change our minds. As we walked back, i saw two cats and i pursued them. As i walked toward them, i heard a strange noise from the gutter. ( i later found out it was a frog croaking.) it scared the crap out of me and i ran off giggling insanely. i was convinced there was a monster in the gutter. the other girl that was with us began croaking and i began laughing in hysterics. By this time i knew it was kicking in.  They went back to get some ecstacy from someone while i wandered around. everything was strange and new. someone approached me wanting to buy a roll. but the strangest thing happened. i couldnt get it out of my wallet. everytime i opened my wallet, it was a confusion of colors and madness. i threw the wallet down on the ground. i couldnt understand why i couldnt get it out. luckily, my friend found the roll and my wallet. then we went n a car ride. ", "i was by the window. looking out the window was the strangest thing that i had ever seen. the driver had put some trance on. when walked around on clematis for a while and by this time i was real messed up.  my mind was wandering. colors swirling in and out. tall buildings and trees were amazingly impressive. when we got back to rocky, we wrnt to the park ad i saw the most beautiful tree i had ever seen in my life. i decided to sit in it. by this time my friends were rolling and quite worried about me wandering off. We went back to rocky and actually went in the theater. what happened was amazing. the input to my brain was overwhelming. all the sounds, the sights, everything. then we went to IHOP. we went into the bathroom, and my pupils were quite large. i couldnt help staring at the stalls. they were the most beautiful shade of purple i had ever seen in my life.  strange rainbow patters, like a metal grid, covered everything. we got a ride home from the most beautiful guy i had ever seen in my life, and i was quite in love with him. when we got home it was about 4:30 AM. One of my friends who was rolling, had some shrooms. we then decided to go outside and explore. ", "we decided to go to the community pool, but we never made it. everyfew steps or so, we would get distracted by something. then i noticed her face. it looked so strange. her eyes were morphing and her face just looked so weird. we were out side for an hour, wandering around. then we went inside and watched the Matrix. it was amazing. I was convinced the guy who wrote the script was tripping. It made perfect sense. After the movie was over, I was convinced i was in the matrix, I ran around screaming, 'there is no spoon!' i really was convinced. suddenly, i was ravenously hungry. i grabbed a sprite and ran into my friends room. 'orange.....AMBIVALENCE!' i said, and we all giggled. i didnt end up opening the can of sprite for about an hour.", "afer that we sat on the floor for hours recalling all our memories. it was the most fun i had in my entire life and i would definately do it again. everything was so beautiful to me. it was the most amazing experience in my life and i believe i learned alot from it, just about how beautiful life is. ", "unfortunately two days later i got extremely sick and vomited for two days straight, but that always happens to me when i try  a new drug. that will not prevent me from trying it again. it was totally different from what i expected, and anyone who wants to see the beauty in life should definately try it.", "I had been tripping for some time, I fell in love with it. I felt as if I were in a fantasy land, and anything I dreamt of was possible. That night me and my best friend decided to trip and walk around the apartment complex. We both took two hits around 8:30. She weighs in at 105 pounds, me 125. Both of our experiences were totally different. Hers was good, mine a living hell.", "We decided to smoke some weed, because it always enhanced our trip. After a couple of bowls of Hydro, I decided to get something to drink. As I got up, I saw everything distorted, words did not makes sense, and I lost myself in my brain and the drug completely. I called out to my friend, and said 'I'm  going to die'. She took me for a walk, and I saw colors and with every step I took, I sunk farther in the ground. I looked at my friend, and she had no body, just a huge face. A car was coming straight at me, and I just stared, she had to pull me out of the way.", "She took me to her house, and tried to calm me down. As I sat on the carpeted floor, my bones were seeping through my skin, I felt knives stabbing at me, and felt the pain. I literally went crazy. The words didn't come out,the pictures i saw were flashes of the devil, angels, clouds, knives ... all I could think of. My body felt like jello, then rock hard. I eventually came off of it around 8:00a.m in the morning. Till this day, I have permanent trails, and lights seem like stars. In the pitch black, I still see colors, and when I think of an object, I can see it. It has been 3yrs since I tripped, and I feel the effects til this day.", "I had never tried LSD, but when a friend failed to come through with some shrooms, she offered tabs of blotter acid to me and some college buddies. Most of them had tried it, but I never had. I was a little nervous at the thought of tripping on acid, but I after consulting with my brother, who has tried it twice, and looking it up on Erowid.org I gave it a go.", "I dropped around 10:30pm in a small apartment in the Beacon Hill ", "section of Boston. My friends wanted to go back to the dorms, but I had promised a friend I would stop by her party, so I walked over with a roommate who was not tripping that night. I figured I would leave before the peak.", "I drank a few beers, and was relaxing at the party talking to friends. I started feeling the minor threshold effects around 11:30 or so. A friend of mine came over and asked me to walk to his apartment on a nearby street to retrieve his three foot glass bong, so I went. It had begun to lightly rain and I remember being awed by the neon lights reflecting in the pools of rainwater.  We got the bong and went back to the party to rip hits. I smoked 5 bongloads out of the three footer, and then sat down and passed the next one as it came around. I was feeling very disoriented and confused, but didn't realize that I had begun to trip hard. I glanced at the clock, which said 12:30. I looked around the table and saw everyone's heads looking huge while their bodies were disproportionately small. I looked all around the apartment and was amazed at how different everything looked. The floor was beginning to move, and I was starting to panic, so I begged my roommate to walk me back to the dorms. I was sick of being the only tripper, and I felt very isolated and alone. ", "I got outside and was completely overcome by the LSD. My mind felt like it was leaving my body, and I became worried I would be unable to find my way back. I grabbed my roommate's arm and did not let go, because I was worried if I did I would drift off. It took an immense deal of concentration to focus and see the sidewalk and city streets, when my mind wandered I would see alien landscapes. If I focused on Boston, then my mind wandered again I never returned to the previous hallucination, it was always new. I felt that the world was extremely fluid and I could reshape and distort the picture of it in my mind. At this point I began to enjoy the experience and tried to relate this to my roommate, who later said I was incomprehensible. I began to believe I was a snake or at least had assumed the form of a snake. Finally, I made it back to the dorm. The rain was pouring now and it was completely overwhelming my senses. I tried my hardest not to make a scene in front of the security guards. ", "I went up to my room and played some videogames with my roommate, but found it difficult to concentrate on it because of the visual distortions and my mind trailing off. Finally he drifted off to sleep around 3am, so I went downstairs to find the other trippers. I found that I was too paranoid to go in the elevator alone, so I ran down six flights of stairs. Finally I found them and stayed in their room for the remainder of the night. Other significant hallucinations included 'breathing' walls, melting faces, I felt that one of my arms had disappeared for a period. I saw neon streaks of rapidly changing colors on the walls that faded in and out. I experienced one point of total ego loss when I became confused as to who I was and what had happened to me. This and the previously mentioned paranoia were the only scary parts of the trip.", "After a time they suggested we watch Alice in Wonderland, which was very trippy. After it was over I went outside to watch the dawn in the Boston Common with one other tripper. We were beginning to come down from the more intense portion of the trip, but we still weren't sober. After a time I went inside and tried to sleep, but couldn't. Eventually I fell asleep around 1pm and slept for three hours. When I woke up I felt sober, but less intelligent than usual. That night I experienced a very brief flashback of the part when I thought I was a snake. I believe it happened because I was smoking pot. The next day I awoke feeling refreshed with no ill effects.", "All in all it was a positive experience. Next time I'll skip the drinking and wait until I'm coming down to smoke pot. Also, I won't take acid as a substitute for shrooms because it is a totally different ballgame. I went into the experience nervous but confident, and came out with a very intense memory of some eye opening psychedelics. I remember feeling like I had learned a lot, but was unable to recall what. Next time I want to try and see what insights I can retain by writing or recording them.", "last year at this time, my friends and i decided to take 'the plunge' with acid. i had smoked a considerable amount of weed by this time, and was very familiar with the effects of a 'high,' but many people glamorized this 'tripping' thing.", "i had a few offers to try it earlier, but in fear of losing my mind, i declined each time. also, i thought LSD was something similar to heroin, or coke or something, and all throughout elementary school and junior high i was told of the horrors of LSD and how it 'fries' your brain.", "eventually, i'd grown up and formed my own views, after indulging in several episodes of weed smoking. i got to college, and one lazy, boring, pot smoking night, a little spanish girl named natalie came to my dorm to ask my roommate if he wanted to buy acid. well, as it was, i had just gotten a considerable amount of money, and was keen to try something new and exciting.", "about 4 friends and i decided that we would all trip together, and go to a local 'hoppin' party. sounded good.", "so, natalie takes a pair of tweezers, and singles out two tiny yellow things from a pencil case, and places them in the palm of my hand. 'what the hell is this?' i asked. 'that's the acid, now where's my fourteen bucks?' i was very surprised at how small the hits were, but i'd never seen acid before, and had nothing to compare it to. ", "my friends and i dropped the acid, then rushed to the store for orange juice, which makes you trip harder, or so they say.", "about 15 minutes later, after asking about a million times 'when will this kick in?', i had intense chills, very tickly, followed by intense episodes of laughter, which my friends got annoyed with, and tried putting their hands over my mouth saying, 'c'mon, keep your composure, what's the matter with you?!' ", "then everything got really bright, and visually pulsating. out of nowhere, there were all of these visuals. i guess i noticed when i tried to focus on something, and saw how lucidly clear, yet backwards it was. when i would put my hand on something, it felt like it was moving. and everything just seemed very wavy. the mindset that went with it was very silly, like being 5 years old in a candy store, a tim burton-esque candy store.", "when i got back to the dorms, i found that my room looked like a disaster area. everything seemed so scattered, so i did the first thing i could think of...eat gummy bears. the gummy bears seemed all weird too, and i imagined that they were pissed at me for eating them, so i stopped.", "my friend kirk, who was very silly at this point, had caught himself up in the blinds on the window, and swore he was being attacked by an octopus. i vigorously tried to save him with an umbrella, and we pretended to be on a hollywood high-seas adventure, playing around like a bunch of children. it was lots of fun.", "after the peak, we decided to sit and play playstation in the dark. the characters in tekken seemed to speak in tongues, translated to:  satan is going to come over with girl scout cookies, and pulverized us with one punch.", "we laughed and laughed for hours, as we tried to decipher the spanish channel. the sounds of foreign languages sounded hilarious! but then again, so did everything.", "as we came further down, we were very chill and complacent with everything around us, still thinking silly stuff, and still having visual distortions.", "sleep was not even a remote possibility. it seemed like bugs were crawling all over me when i tried to lie still under the blankets.", "my friends claimed to have been still getting visuals when they went to sleep, and they had no problems actually falling asleep. but i was antsy as hell for about 6 more hours.", "all in all, LSD was very fun, and something i would do again. it seems as though it discombobulates your mind, and puts it together at random throughout a trip, and if you have a fucked up mind, this may not be for you!!", "i've also heard that for some people DXM is stronger or equal to LSD. it's not as strong, or as visually interesting and spacy as LSD, at least not in my opinion.", "LSD was also my gateway drug to MDMA and mescaline, which led to some difficulty, so just be careful, okay, don't get wrapped up in tripping, it can be very costly.", "i don't want to post this because it's a second hand report that could be fictitious, and it's also disgusting. -- spoon", "It started off as innocent fun.  Last Saturday, an associate of mine (lets call him J) at the local grocery store decided that he wanted to dose our frozen manager as a joke.  Keep in mind that this friend is somewhat crazy himself.  He regularly ingests LSD and shrooms as if they are candy.  On break, J put 17 blue geltabs into the near empty pot of coffee in the break room, all this time knowing that our frozen manager would be going on break within minutes to have his usual 3 cups of coffee.  Sure enough at 11:15 PM, our frozen manager goes on break and begins drinking his coffee. At this point I knew the situation would be getting very ugly later on. I proceeded to leave the breakroom with J and returned to work. About 20 minutes or so later the frozen manager comes down the stairs and is laughing hysterically and cracking jokes to everyone.  He then returned to work in the aisle.  I knew we were going to be in for some crazy shit soon.  About five minutes later J went to check how our frozen manager was.  Moments later, J calls me over to the aisle.", "At this point my manager was throwing boxes of stock all over the aisle.  He started shouting 'Pot pies! So many chicken pies!'  I went over to him to see if I could calm him down somewhat. I asked him if he was okay and he just said 'Chicken pot pies have no meaning anymore!' He then threw a case of stock at my head, but missed and instead hit one of the freezer doors and it cracked! At this point J fled work in fear of what the manager could be capable of.  I quickly left the aisle in hopes that our manager would calm down.", "I returned ten minutes later and the frozen manager was nowhere to be found. I went into the backroom to find him, but I he was nowhere to be seen.  I then went to the freezer and there he was.....completely naked.  It was the most horrendous sight I had ever seen.  Then man was in sitting in a puddle of his of own shit and urine masturbating.  He kept repeating the words 'Brains and machines! Brains and machines!'  I again asked him if he is okay (which he obviously wasn't), and he just kept mumbling to himself in gibberish.  At this point I was freaking out because I didn't know what to do.  My manager then suddenly stopped moving momentarily, looked at me, and ran out of the freezer.", "I then called 911 and told them to send an ambulance to the store. The frozen manager ran into the frozen aisle (still naked) and put his fists through a glass door.  He was a bloody mess.  I shouted at him that maybe its was time that he go home.  He retorted to me 'Time? Time, you say? Time has no meaning anymore! IT DOESN'T MATTER!' He then was spotted by a horrified customer.  He ran done the aisle and clocked the old woman right in the face.  Her nose was broken.  I tended to the woman until help arrived.  According to the store's front end manager, the manger ran out of the store naked into the parking lot moments later.", "A kid who was doing carts said that the manager started to yell at people in the parking lot about 'the gnomes'. He kept grabbing his head and yelling 'Spiders and monkeys! Spiders and monkeys!' A minute or two later, an ambulance and police car arrived at the store.  The manager could not be restrained and he punched out two police officers. He then took cinder blocks from the green house area and threw them through the windshields of several cars. At this point the manager ran back into the store and he was crying. He ran into the back room and opened the back doors of the store.  I didn't even attempt to restrain him in fear that he would kill me. According to a fellow employee, the manager jumped onto a mule (a motorized lift for moving pallets of stock) and rode it out of the back of the store.", "He kept yammering things such as 'I am the captain of the crystal ship!' and 'Land ho!' He drove the mule out onto the main highway rode in front of the store. I assume that the paramedics must have called for more cops, because three more squad cars arrived and maced the frozen manager. Traffic outside came to a halt as this was happening also.  It took five cops to hold him down and put a straight jacket and muzzle onto him. It was a disturbing sight.  I don't really know details what happened to him after that. As for my friend, he hasn't been arrested because nobody saw him put the LSD in the coffee besides me, and I wasn't going to rat on him. Therefore, he is no more a suspect than anybody else in the store. A police investigation is underway.  My manager, on the other hand, is fine (I guess), but he has taken an extended 2 week vacation and has requested a transfer to a different store. We'll see what happens next....", "On Halloween, my roomate's girlfriend decided we should have a tripping party with some of our friends at her apartment. Upon arriving there, I ingested my hits and sat in her living room waiting for the effects to kick in. Some of my fellow trippers, those that rode with me to her house, dropped at the same time while others didn't drop for a few more hours, when they arrived.", "The first 'problems' occured when my roomate's girlfriend's friends came. The amount of tripping people in one room was seven. What I experianced was an extreme sense of deja voo. I thought that the conversations were repeating themselves and this repetition manifested itself as me being in a circle with everyone repeating themselves over and over. Many people would consider this experience a bad trip; however I didn't. ", "On later trips I noticed a strange effect. The more people tripping in one small area leads to a more intense experience. I feel this is due to the extremely vunerable position tripping puts ones mind in.", "Now, later in the Halloween night, a division of the group occured. I noticed that there was an ongoing argument between 3 vs. 4 of the group about whether the lights should be on or off. Some of us wanted to sit in the dark the whole time watching trails or tracers on glowsticks while others, including myself, wished to discuss philosophy in the light so we could see our visuals. The strangest thing about the night happened when one of the Dark Tracers, as we called them, lost a glow stick. They immediatly accused us of stealing it. Every five minutes they would send a 'diplomat' to try to negotiate our return of the stolen glowstick, but we did not have it. They got so paranoid of us and our sinister plans to keep their glowstick that none of them notice in the 50 or so times they walked into the bathroom that the glowstick was sitting on the floor by the toilet. How a person can not notice a glowstick in a dark bathroom while tripping I'll never know.", "I came to the conclusion that these events are what people call a bad trip. I did not think the trip was bad, just that the people in the room didn't all know each other and there were disagreements about how the most enjoyable tripping experiance could be attained. I do not think that bad trips bring on flashbacks but I haven't had one so I don't know. I have taken exactly 89 1/2 hits in my life over a period of 3 years and find that I now have the ability to concentrate and induce flashbacks. Is this a strange occurance or do others notice this also? Peace to all who wish it.", "I saw the film american beauty tonight. The 'moral' made so much sense to me because of how my acid trip on the fourth of july congealed meanings and existences for me. To say that everything is 'okay' would be both understatement and would not do justice to the calm and comfort with existence that I felt. The main character exhibited these features and the plastic bag dancing in the wind showed me that I am not insane for finding mundane, inconsequential things like that gorgeous. ", "I have faith vested in some overarching concept that includes humans, but I cannot say what. It is larger, but not gigantic--infinitesimal but not insignificant. I have trouble calling it a thing, because this tends to imply that there is something to be learned or understood about it. I personally feel that on some level, all humans understand it but that some tap into this understanding with more ease than others. To call it god would not do it justice, due to the social meanings applied to that word. To personify it would be fruitless, for it encompasses all of humanity, life and existence and holds within it all human experience--that which has happened, that which is happening, and that which is going to happen, all encoded in some vast fullness. ", "When I had my first trip july fourth, I felt like I had tapped into this 'collective consciousness'. It was very good acid according to those whom I knew there who had experience with the substance. It was on a roof of an apartment building in the city and we were waiting for the fireworks to begin. A few hours before, I knew that I would have an opportunity to take some 'mind-expanding' substances, but I didn't know specifically what. I decided to try LSD because I knew quite a bit about its history, and that set and setting factored heavily into the experience. I felt that this setting was good even though i was in an unfamiliar place because I was with two friends whom I trust on a very fundamental level. I also wasn't taking any medications or the like at that time. There were quite a few people there that I didn't know at all, but this didn't bother me at all. I took two tabs about forty-five minutes before the fireworks started--the tabs were basically white construction paper, no patterns or designs. Fifteen minutes before the fireworks, I took one hit from a joint. I will discuss the connection to weed a bit more below. ", "About five minutes into the fireworks I started to feel something and started to really get into the experience of watching the fireworks--the lines of smoke, the bursts, the classical music drifting up from somewhere below and in front of us. I remember some acquaintances calling out the element that made that particular firework that color. I remember feeling the acid hit me hard when one kid said 'oh, and that's magnesium'. The experience soon morphed into a belief that what I was experiencing was a sort of limbo from which all people's lives emanated. Limbo was sitting on a roof watching fireworks and listening to classical music. And it would just keep going until you went down to get a glass of water (one existence or life), went to the side to make out (another existence), but you would always come back to watching fireworks and listening to classical music, which was a very pleasing and unthreatening experience. ", "As the trip progressed, sounds and meanings of words started to phase. They went out of sync and, due to phase cancellation their 'true' meanings and sounds were revealed. (This phenomenon is not unlike the audio equivalent of phasing--check out Steve Reich's early works with tape loops: 'It's Gonna Rain' and 'Come Out'). What I mean by 'true' is not equivalent to 'inherent', but more so what I perceived to be the truth for the portion of humans that I know. This phasing continued while I slowly leaned back and closed my eyes. Apparently I was rolling around on the roof mumbling incoherently, but I was having an amazing experience. I only harbor a little regret for not having seen any visual hallucinations, but I am not a very visual person compared to some. Still, even without visuals, this shit was tweaking/repeating/phasing audio and then progressed to tweaking existential meaning in the same way. ", "What happened while I was lying down with my eyes shut, or 'under', is difficult to explain. I felt like I was connecting to all and everything--going out in all directions while simultaneously delving inward. I experienced utter ego surrender--I knew that I had a prior existence as 'me', but since I had this knowledge of the interconnectedness of all things, I felt safe, secure and comfortable in being a part of that and moving with its ebb and flow. Whether or not I came back to the reality I knew as 'me' was not an issue. I knew that my life was 'right', including all the 'bad' shit. While 'under', I understood the meanings of all the 'evil' and wrongs that exist(ed)/will exist and that they came as a package deal with existence. I understand evil's place, in a sense. It is possible that I understood that good vs. bad/evil is an extremely subjective thing, even if those definitions are accepted throughout the society.  Also, that which one finds to be bad or evil could be considered to be a comparative thing that helps one see, appreciate and enjoy what one perceives as 'good'. ", "The trip was getting molecular (approx. two hours after I had taken the tabs and about an hour into the trip) and in doing so, it made me realize how the interconnectedness was also on a molecular level and emanated in all directions. This was definitely the peak of the experience, and it included utter ego surrender. There was an overarching mental image that was similar to others' description of the 'kaleidoscope' effect that somehow incorporated a profile of my head with spherical molecular structures intertwining--not unlike the type of molecular structures pictured on Erowid. My body also was incorporated into this phasing, kaleidoscopic image. I remember feeling my entire body being washed with waves of warmth and pleasure. ", "The 'come down' from the peak (about two hours into the trip) was fascinating-just as something coming back into phase with something else, reality slowly phased back into itself, and I raised my upper body, saw one of the friends I had come there with who was sitting next to me, and muttered, with awe, 'whoa'. There was a slight breeze, and John Lennon's song 'imagine' that had been playing through the speakers on the roof was ending at about this time: 'and the world shall live as one...' this fragment repeated in my head and created some gorgeous textures. Repetition was a huge factor in my trip-a type of repetition that was slightly different in feel and scope with each supposed repetition, thus making for a feeling of constancy, but coupled with progression and a sort of evolution. After I came out of being 'under'--probably a little less than three hours after I started tripping--I was only a little bit disoriented, but I felt relatively 'normal', barring a sore jaw and an awareness of my tingling nervous system. I had no more hallucinatory effects from the LSD, but I couldn't sleep one bit that night. ", "I now share this comfort with and understanding of all aspects of existence with the main character of 'american beauty' and I share wonderment with the character 'Ricky' in things usually found to be odd. In the movie, the man's face at the moment of his own death was one of contentment. I understood. Ricky did too. I think this may have had something to do with the ego surrender and the trust in the larger collective consciousness. ", "Back to the pot. Having smoked a little weed before the acid hit me did some interesting things. For the first few times that I smoked pot afterwards (we're talking weeks after, not hours or days), I became extremely aware of my nervous system and could feel the impulses speeding along the nerves sending signals to my brain through my spinal cord. This feeling eventually subsided, but it was something I was really grateful for because it made me aware of my body. I recently had a minor flashback from smoking quite a bit of weed that involved racing christmas lights and a spherical reflective surface. These combined to produce trails that circled the room with the lights and a wonderful reflection of those same trails in the extinguished ceiling light.", "If you feel uncomfortable about the idea of ego surrender, then LSD might not be for you. That's cool, because William S. Burroughs himself said that drugs are a means to different levels of consciousness, but they shouldn't be solely depended upon, because they aren't the only means to attain mind expansion. Personally, I probably won't do acid again for quite a while, because I feel like I learned so much and can learn so much more from this trip that I'm going to need a bit more time to sort everything out. The most central thing I learned to be true for me was that all people experience some sort of hope, comfort, or contentment during their life, even for a millisecond. And in that millisecond, according to my trip, there is a complete lifetime.", "I've been smoking weed & hash for the past 3-5 years & i've tried almost everything but ACID. I made a deal with my bro 3 years ago that I'd only do it if he was around cuz he has done acid alot, just in case I freak out. I was visiting my bro (E) in US & on 4th Jan 2001. (E) got some Acid we took the first hit around 10:30 pm, E went to spin & I just sat & waited for something to happen after all I've been researching on Acid for almost a year.", "12 am, nothing I only had a headache cuz I haven't slept well. So me bro called his friend (K) & he came around 12:45 with some more Acid, GHB & Ketamine <-- my favorite anyway.", "2 am, still nothing & I was getting so bored & sleepy the only thing I felt different were colors they were more alive. (K) walked up to me & asked if I wanted more, I Said yes & this time I took 4 hits (crazy I know) but I was starting to feel that this shit doesnt work with me. I was wrong. ", "3:30 am I started Trippin funny, I was on the sofa & I was a bit cold so I covered myself with a red blanket, 15 mins after that I was laughing & yelling & jumpin my ass on the sofa & when the guys asked me whats Wrong with me I Simply said : there's a fuckin Star Trek episode down here of course I was the hero. ", "The guys didn't wana leave me long on the couch & they convinced me that I have'nt seen anything yet, So K pulls me & takes me close to the black light in the corner & shows me his Tattoo. Wooooooooooow I couldnt open my mouth I was all eyes looking at the best 3-d tattoo i've ever seen. After a bit of GHB, dancing & beer I was starting to feel funny so I went to WC to wash my face, I locked myself in looked at the mirror & I was shocked, It was'nt me I kept looking at myself 4 a while not knowing that my vision was fucked up not me. It started getting quiet & I thought that the guys left (I was so focused on the mirror that I lost contact with everything but my vision & my reflection on the mirror). I started talking to myself within me & sometime there I just got hot so I decided to sit. 2 mins after that everything was going black, I felt like trapped in a coffin & I choked. 4 a min there I thought I was dying & I calmed down like I never did & then I heard a voice saying hey wake up & snap out of it, you're ok it's only what u took, concentrating on that voice, it was mine!! I donno how that happend then. ", "I'm sure I forgot a part, I was in there for 5 mins, felt like a year, anyway I dragged myself out & I went out of the house, took the dog 4 a walk etc... When I came back everyone was looking for me they thought I jumped in the lake near by or something I dont remember well but the one thing I wont forget was that look on my bro's face. He asked if I was ok & I smiled back & said, yeah I'm chillin. I had 2 more tabs a while after that.. I've done Acid 13 other times & I still will. You may be asking yourself WHY ?? Simply read below :", "ACID is a never ending story, the key to a good trip is inside of me, it takes alot of courage & faith & dont ever let anyone talk you into anything if you're not ready. Personally I dont believe in ADDICTION i think it's all in our head I had second thoughts about myself when my trip went down but instead of passing out overdosed in the tub, I partied for 3 days nonstop. ", "P.s : I wrote this after having 2 hits & I think i've been writing all that for the past 4 hours, I'm too tired to go over it again, anyway I'M SORRRRYYYY IF I SOUNDED STUPID take care all & dont forget THE WORLD IS BETWEEN YOUR HANDS, WE MAKE OUR OWN FATE & OUR OWN TRIP", "As I see some people might be interested in this, I thought I'd submit my experience in order to keep people from making the same mistake I did.  ", "I heard from several people that LSD could be administered through the eye and that the onset would be much quicker.  I decided to give it a try but could not find any liquid LSD.  Finally, I said screw it and decided to put a hit of blotter under my eyelid.  The onset wasn't any faster than the oral route.  A little bit after it had kicked in, I felt it come out of my eye and fall to the floor.  I started to look for it but couldn't find it.", "I finally came down and was able to sleep.  The next morning I woke up and noticed the hit was still in my eye.  Of course, I took it out and went on with my business.  ", "It's been a few years since the experience now.  Every two or three weeks, the area in my eye closest to my nose gets red and irritated.  It was not until a couple years ago that I realized it was the same eye I put the hit in.  I would blame it on impurities, but the acid was very clean.  I never experienced any backache or cramps on it.  Thank God I didn't repeat the experience.", "All right, I just want to let you all know that I'm writing this to perhaps guide or inform those who are curious and thinking about doing acid. First off, I've done it on around 10 different occasions. I took one hit the first time and experienced mild euphoria as well as visual distortions, and the last time I did it I did four hits, the most I've ever taken. I consider myself to have a pretty good head on my shoulders, and to be of average intelligence. As other people on this web site have mentioned, LSD can and will make permanent, marked changes to your personality based on your dosage and set/setting. ", "The main time-frame of my life that I want to write about is about a year and a half ago, the summer of 1999. I was working at a state park in Vermont and living with a friend of mine at my father's log cabin in southern Vermont. About half-way through the summer, we decided to ride down to Hartford, Connecticut, to a rock concert to pick up some acid. We found what we were looking for soon enough, and decided to purchase 20 hits. We took two that night and had a very introspective trip, but were in our own worlds more or less, lying on the couches and listening to classical music (which was incredible). Over the next three weeks we each finished our 10 hits.", "Now is the part that I really want people to listen to. Upon returning to school for fall semester, I was very paranoid and didn't feel like leaving my apartment at all. All my friends told me that I 'seemed distracted' or 'preoccupied' and I felt extreme difficulty interacting properly or in an acceptable manner. I just barely passed my classes that semester and then decided to take the next semester off to 'chill out' for awhile. During this hiatus from school, I decided, on my parents' advice as well, to see a psychiatrist. Well, after an hour session with this supposedly very experienced professional, I was told that I have schizophrenia. I've been on medication for it ever since, and have not touched psychedelics (except for some pot). I never really heard or hear any voices or anything like that, I just have a lot of the negative symptoms (which means that I lack some of the personality traits that I used to have). There really isn't much more to this story, it is just to let you know that even though I probably would have gotten schizophrenia anyway had I not taken the acid, the acid probably brought it out, and if you think that in any way you might be suspect for a mental illness, you should probably avoid this drug and maybe even mushrooms and pot. I hope that my relating this experience will help someone, and I'm not saying never do acid, but be aware that it is a very powerful drug and you have to know your limits.", "HUMOROUS AND FAIRLY WELL WRITTEN BUT I JUST CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO DISPLAY AN ODE TO 'LIQUIDING'. GOOD ENOUGH FOR CELLAR THOUGH.", "I've always felt that I had a psychedelic bent to me, that I was meant to enjoy substances like acid and mushrooms.  I've been a pothead for two years and have always liked best the psychedelic and mind-expanding aspects of the holy herb.  Anyhow, over the last year, I've significantly expanded my experimentation... first ecstacy, then mushrooms, and then, two nights ago, I had the opportunity to drop acid for the first time.", "Saturday night was the night of Winter Wonder, a massive professional rave in Chicago.  Most of the music was hardcore and jungle.  I went there with a best friend, and had the time of my life (I was also sober).  It was my second party (the first one in contrast had been pretty dead), and I enjoyed every aspect of it... the psychedelic atmosphere, the massive gathering of people my age group having a great time, the music, the glowsticks... everything was ILL.  Anyhow, halfway through I start looking for pills.  I've dropped ecstacy a total of four times before, and always enjoyed it, so I thought it would be a nice addition to the experience.  I ask one dude who had complimented me on the shirt I was wearing whether he could get me some pills, and he directed me instead to his friend who was selling liquid acid.", "One kid held up a lighter while his friend dropped a single little droplet of a bluish substance on my hand out of what looked like a Binaca bottle.  The minute from when he started squeezing the bottle to when the acid dropped on my hand felt like a millenium, and I remember thinking ... this is the point of no return, I either stop him before it drops or I take the shit and see what happens.  Anyhow, I lick it up.  It's all minty-fresh, and he says it should hit me in an hour.", "Anyhow later, right when my acid should be kicking in, my ride decides he is tired and wants to go home.  I go up to the dealer first and complain, and he acts surprised... he honestly expected me to be tripping.  I kind of knew right then that he probably had given me real acid because a truly shady dealer who wanted to rip you off wouldnt stay in the same goddamn spot!  Anyhow, we get back to my friend's house.  In the car on the way over, I notice I'm starting to feel giddy and laughing at a lot of shit, but I just attribute this to leftover 'rave energy'.  Back in my friend's room, we start toking a few bowls.  Right then, I notice a new sensation coming on.  I start feeling like I'm shrooming a little bit... everything I see starts flowing a tad, I start to see motion, colors and music are enhanced, and I tell my friend 'I am definitely on something... I think that acid was real'.", "First off, I start feeling like I'm on a combination of several rolls and a shitload of bong hits.  I feel great and I'm tripping out on EVERYTHING.  His sister has a wall covered with psychedelic rave flyers, and I can't take my eyes off it as they start to transform and flow and colors start to move around.  I start to dissect every sound in the jungle music my friend is playing on his stereo (Dieselboy will always be my friend from now on)... music turns into a shimmering landscape of sound, exquisite.  The whole thing is feeling like shrooms, except a lot more fun, a lot more visual... snd very hippy-ish (i don't know why, but I just felt that way).  Anyhow, my friend's getting tired... he turns off the lights and I take out the glowsticks, still going strong, from the party.  That's when the real fun and the deep thoughts start.", "I start thinking about my experiences at the rave party.  Suddenly every little moment from my memory only hours earlier and every little bit of visuals and music coming into me right now all combine and everything starts to make sense.  I start to realize what's so cool about raving, how it's a totaly psychedelic experience, how I could be at home in that scene for the rest of my life.  Liquiding with glowsticks becomes insanely fun as I am getting mad tracers and the glow patterns are swirly and wavy and shit.  Everything starts to feel just right, like what I experienced at the rave is just the way things should be, how I should go back and back.  My friend falls asleep, and after about 30 more minutes of liquiding (I seriously couldn't stop), I move into the other room.", "I want to add a few notes on liquiding.  I actually remember how I was describing it (and I still think it is just about the most fulfilling activity you can partake in while tripping acid).  My trip itself was kind of like a plasmic space, a little beyond my body, almost like a deep aura.  With liquiding I almost felt like I was feeling out its boundaries with my hands, expressing the psychedelic thrusts of my consciousness.  It was mad fun.  Anyhow, I am alone for the remaining few hours and I am still tripping hard.  The fact that I didn't have a bad trip, despite the fact that I am alone and I am on a drug I have never tried before which has been known to make many people freak out only reinforces my perception that I am meant to have lots of fun with psychedelic drugs.", "I go into my friend's other room and chill with his cats, and start to realize just how crazy his cats really are.  They keep fighting and doing weird shit and bumping into walls and I am just laughing and laughing.  In fact, I had been laughing mad-style ever since I started tripping.  Everything that had been scary on shrooms was just funny on acid.  And by scary I don't mean like bad trippy, but just any sudden sound on shrooms used to make me freak out for half a second, you know shock me and make me jump.  I was real edgy on shrooms, but on acid, every time I heard a sudden sound, I felt like I had almost expected it half a second before, and automatically knew where it was coming from, what it was, and not to be afraid.  Instead, I chilled with and laughed at everything I was hearing and seeing.", "I get back into my friend's room and have the only true hallucination of the night, as he turns white and plastery and shrinks.  Also, his head would turn momentarily and glare at me before going back to its originally sleeping position.  I find this disturbing at first, but funny later.  I start looking for cigarettes (I am quite a smoker), and go through a pile of Bidis in my jacket pocket, every single one of which was broken in a way that I couldn't smoke it.  I was left jonesing all night... for a while I was clutching a bidi in one hand and just lying in one position for about an hour.  I think I might have even slept an hour or two as I noticed it was daylight when I again raised my head.  Anyhow, I was still tripping, and noticed how cool all the buildings looked outside his high-rise apartment window, and how all the heating smoke would blow out of chimneys in rhythm with the music I was listening to and shit.", "I started coming down and feeling a massive back-ache and stomachache.  Eating food helped the stomachache somewhat, but I knew I was jonesing for a cigarette.  Eventually, after I have come down, I get a pack of cigarettes and finally take care of that.  About time, man.  I reflect on my trip afterwards... it was immensely good, but I am afraid I could become an acid-head just because I had such a good time.  But then again, the fact that I was MASSIVELY CRACKED OUT for two days might convince me otherwise.  Think constant tiredness, inability to fucking move, MASSIVE FUCKING BACK-ACHE... it was worse than after ecstacy, but then again I always took HTP after E which is probably why I never got cracked out from that.  Anyhow, I stopped feeling cracked out seriously about an hour ago... it has been two days since I tripped, and I am going to get some sleep.", "Acid is definitely something I want to do again, as I had a really positive experience both about the drug and about the rave scene.  I could see myself even now becoming a real participant in it, and this mind-change happened almost overnight... thus, I am one of those hated 'insta-ravers'.  Whatever, I am who I am.", "I also owe an apology to the dude who sold me that acid, because I was bitching cause I thought he had sold me bunk shit.  Turned out it just took three hours to kick in.  -NH", "it was most likely a fairly irresponsible thing to do, but since I was tandem I didn't fret about it. Would definitly not recommend doing this if you've never jumped or are doing a solo.", "The entire afternoon that I was out at the jump site was amazing. the sky was filled with an almost snow-like scene, except every speck was alive and moving with the music coming from some guy's car stereo. Whenever a parachutist would come down, the specks would seem to glide out of the way and then slowly refill the void.", "the actual jump was beyond explanation. when the airplane door opened at 9000' it was like I was transported back in time and was being born. an almost ethereal peace settled over me and then I let go of the plane's strut and floated off. At this point it was almost a mental and emotional overload as every part of me tried to come to grips with weightlessness and seeing the ground so far away with the wind rushing by at seemingly supersonic speeds. the sunset created the best visuals I've ever experienced before. the rays were racing around the clouds and intertwining with each other creating beautiful landscapes in the sky. when the chute opened the entire scene shifted again to something almost pastoral. greens became really deep and livid and the river was undulating across my field of vision. every aspect of my vision seemed alive and moving with graceful motions. the touch down was extremely soft and pleasant and my body became a part of the field and everything seemed to be cheering and clapping and generally being excited by the whole affair.", "that explanation doesn't really do justice to the experience, but it's always good to share good trips in some way. has anyone else done something similar with good results? again, I wouldn't recommend doing something like this, but it just so happened that I did it. wasn't planned at all, it just came together to create one of the best trips I've ever had.", "I took 8 doses w/ sum friends and my now ex-girlfriend, I weighed about 115 pounds than, I am 5'11, so I am a bean pole.  I had taken 7 doses two times before this nite, and sadly I recall being dosed more than 8 times, but everyone is too fucked up to remember. I remember our friend who dropped me going 1,2,3,3,4,5,6,6,6,7,8 rofl.... so who the fuck knows, anyways...", "It was all good until the cops showed up to bust the out door rave I was at, and I was tripn bout having my half zip of bomb on me etc.  Also when we got to the car 3 cop cars happened to be parked right infront of it.  Anyways, everyone in the car was on 8 doses or more, and the driver could no longer drive so she pulls over after we get far enuff from the party in a gas station, luckily someone I knew drove passed and recognized our car.  They gladly offered to drive, and we headed for another party.  My friend likes bass, and the bronco had a phat sound system including a box w/ 2 10's.... so Im sitting in the back, needing to take a piss with mad bass and I all of a sudden start seeing random ass cop faces, and morbid ass shit all around me, now I have never seen anything like that usually trails, colors, and grid patterns.  ", "So I started to feel really insecure, we get to the party and he tells us we have pay to get in.. so were like uh wtf we need to save our money...  he also informs me that he wants to borrow the money for him and his girl to get in, well I had the money, but it wasnt mine it was my girls, and she was too fucked up to realize so I got him and his girl getting all crazy w/ me about the money and Im like this shit aint even mine.  At this point I was way gone.... we get home, and I lay in my bed... I remember certain flashes of what happened the next 5 hours, but I really only remember almost waking up out of a dream, only to find my girl and everyone else gone....everything starts hitting me, I had fucking wigged out hardc0re on my girl, and not even realized what I was doing.

I will tell you it changed me, yeh it opened my mind up to alot of things but it also closed some doors for me.", "I did acid for the second time over the weekend. It was of course a remarkable experience which words are inadequate to describe, but I was astonished at how different it was from last time. I'm interested in advice from experienced trippers as to whether what I experienced is common or anything to worry about.", "My first trip, a couple of months ago, was 1 1/2 tabs of what was probably averagely strong acid. We stayed indoors the whole time listening to music and watching things melt etc. It was a totally pleasant experience. The visuals came on almost as soon as it kicked in and there was at all times a sense that 'I' was there in the middle of it all, watching all the groovy stuff going on around me.", "On the latter occasion we (I was in different company) took 1 1/3 tabs each of some pretty strong acid in the afternoon and went outside for some things to look at. This was the first time I ventured outdoors on acid and I got rather paranoid at times. I felt that just sitting there looking at the trees and clouds was suspicious (I'm still not sure if it wasn't!) and that some cop or other authority figure would question us. This was compounded, or perhaps even induced, by a period during which one mischievous aspect of my personality transplanted the faces of people I knew onto passers-by.", "The biggest difference was in my mental state. The visuals took longer to come on (maybe because when it kicked in I was still walking to my destination?) and at times were more threatening. They could get pretty impressive though! I also got distinct tracers, mingled in with trails from birds and insects. But all this was getting hard to concentrate on because my mind was reeling. While I was peaking time was sliding around in a deeply weird way. 'I' was outside it and could marvel at this phenomenon and wonder how to describe it. My personality later 'fragmented' into a myriad of alter egos I never knew I had, some of which I got to meet face to face looking in a mirror later on. (I might describe these in another posting if anyone's interested.) The personalities, some of which were disturbingly dark and sinister, were 'battling' for control. 'I' was in some higher mental state (cliche!), able to experience this conflict, but still at risk of losing control if I lost my mental battles. The thoughts rushing around in my head weren't what you'd normally experience as thoughts, they had their own autonomy, as if they were alive independently of my mind. The mental struggle was exhausting - I was experiencing my mind 'raw' and unfiltered. In this state it was natural to be thinking multiple trains of thought or experiencing multiple consciousnesses simultaneously. Maybe that's what it's like to be schizophrenic. I began to wonder if I was having a bad trip. My conclusion was that I probably wasn't as this wasn't really nightmarish, I wasn't freaking out or breaking down or anything. It was just mentally tiring, and I wanted to relax and fully enjoy the visuals.", "I found two mantras helpful, should anyone find themselves in a similar situation. For public situations, 'they don't know you're tripping until you tell them', and for when things got really intense, 'it's just the drug fucking with your mind'. Sometimes I had to repeat this one over and over to myself before I could regain control.", "Later we got back home. On the way I was pleased to sense that I had 'won' my battles and by the time we arrived the personalities were gradually merging back into one. Now at last I could enjoy the hallucinations listening to ambient music. I was still frying a bit 14 hours after dropping.", "So what caused all this mental turmoil, and will it happen again? Was I having a bad trip? There are two possibilities: first, the stress of being outdoors must have had an effect. Second, I was smoking loads of pot this time, unlike the other, and pot tends to make my mind race a bit when I'm not concentrating on anything. I should add that I am normally a very stable person emotionally and seeing all these other selves was quite shocking.", "But it was quite a revelation to meet these other versions of myself, and I'll be better equipped to deal with them in future, but I'm really not all that keen on going through that again. Are experiences like this common? Is the only alternative to give up acid? If I don't, what's going to happen next time?", "The last trip was a few months ago. Instead of going into the details of my trip, I would like to offer what I've learned about my experience.", "The unconscious becomes awakened to the conscious self. All the person's hopes, dreams and life in general can come rocketing out of the sub-conscious. This leads to a sense of joy and euphoria. Later, this turned negative when I was confronted with the harsh realities that life doesn't always go as I would like or plan. This was due to my actions and responses to what my hidden fears are and what I know to be reality. I admit that this was disturbing to me at first. I felt as if I was falling (not literally, but in the general sense) and it became difficult for me to get on with the rest of my life. Recently I turned to meditations and Tai-Chi in order to 'get a grip' on the way that I am and to move forward. Luckily, I found some spiritual people and fellow acid heads to guide me through the mess that I thought I was creating for myself. (In truth I was creating a mess without really knowing it and what to do about it.)", "Now, I am developing a greater understanding of 'who I am' and 'where I came from.' Each time I meditate and perform the steps that I know are necessary, a greater sense of myself deepens and grows. ", "There is some truth to the dangers of tripping. The proper context, setting and timing are very important. What happens to a person when they come down can be troublesome if you're not careful, as I discovered. It doesn't matter how well-adjusted you may think you are. People who are 'loopy' to begin with probably wouldn't even notice the difference.", "I will recommend to anyone to at least try the drug. I myself used it 5-7 times in the last 12 years with only 1 trip that had mixed results. The others were a lot of fun. Tripping does nothing to a person that isn't already there. Those who are fearful or unhappy will discover why, as opposed to those who are always happy and joyful. Those who blame the drug for whatever it is that they became later, after they had a bad trip, never took the time to stop and think about who they are.", "So, if you have a bad trip and you think you're a bit off base or off track, for god's sake don't panic. This only makes matters worse. Never try to rationalize away anything. I don't believe in 'talking yourself out of it.' You are only pushing the dirt under the carpet, so to speak. It will only creep up on you later. Take a deep breath once in awhile and try something new. You only live once. The most powerful drug in the world can never change the way that you are. If anything it can give you a chance to have a look at yourself and let you decide what you think and if you don't know, ask questions.", "So what did I discover about myself? That I think and worry too much.... Oh well, live and learn. I can't say that I am proud to have this experience but at least I learned something.", "1 1/2 weeks ago my friend David and I had an extremely traumatic experience which I am sure will make all of you even more convinced that the police are a bunch of fucking bastards and that the system (wherever you are) stinks to high heaven.", "But first let me tell you about the circumstances of this experience. 5 days earlier I went to a huge rave (about 6000 people) in Cape Town, South Africa (where I live and where this whole story is set) ; I dropped a cap of acid and had the most uplifting, euphoric experience of my life. There were no fantastic visuals or anything - in fact 4 rfiends had caps from the same batch and said they were practically duds. Anyway , my trip was so good that I thought I must be the luckiest person out of all the thousands of people there ; I won't go into much more detail about it cause there are no words to appropriately describe what I had experinced. The point of this is that when it came to the trip Dave and I were to have later that week, I *knew* that it would be good; I was still basking in the glory of the one at the rave.", "This was also to be our first trip outside of clubs or raves ,so I was nervous but excited with anticipation. The night before we went to a club to buy the acid - we only got one cap to split between us, but this was a double-dipped silver surfer flown in fresh from Amsterdam that afternoon, so we presumed we had made a prety good purchase.", "Now for the main part of the story. The next evening Dave and I went to the shopping complex at the cape Town waterfront and bought tickets for the animated film Pocahontas. At 5.15 we went into the cinema and dropped our half-tabs. Half an hour and that lovely tingling feeling we know so well began. After an hour or so I was getting very restless and sucking furiously on the lollypop I had. But I was determined to follow the plot of the movie right to the end and in fact I did - despite sometimes getting lost in arbitary little details of the animation, and becoming aware that the walls around me were changing colour.", "Then the movie ended and... bang! pow! ..the trip kicked in so hard I didnt know what hit me! We could hardly get out of our seats cause everything was so fucked up. When we made it outside the archway with pictures on the walls was warping hectically and I felt warm with pleasure and weirdness. Dave and I needed to go for a piss and when I stood at the urinal I thought peeing was the funniest stupidest thing in he world. We then proceeded to walk around the shopping centre, amazed at the wonderful sights and sounds that hit us. There was a funny old dude playing the piano- this sounded like the most hectic happy hardcore we'd ever heard. I watched David's lollypop pulsating while he told me that he was seeing it leave long trails when he waved it around.", "We took a stroll outside where it was really cold, so decided to go to the car to fetch our jackets. At the parking lot there was a security guard who seemed to be watching our every move. Now in the car we had a couple of joints waiting for us (this was to be yet another first for us - smoking up while peaking on acid) but I said to Dave that we'd better leave that for now because the security guard was making me a bit nervous... she was looking straight at us and talking into her radio... I didn't want any cops to come roaming around looking for someone like us to pounce on. So anyway we left the car and I forgot about being worried and continued to enjoy my superb trip.", "We headed for the BMW pavilion where they have luxury cars hanging from the ceiling - this was intensly amusing - and clean , smooth decor ,polished floors etc which was very pleasing to look at. But of course we wanted some more adventure, so we headed back towards the shopping centre... when we came to cross a road I remarked to Dave that I could feel the sounds of the passing cars deep within me, but all he could do was burst out laughing in reply.", "Back at the shopping centre we went into a sweet shop filled with millions of brightly colored sweets; I somehow managed to buy a long stick of gum and when we came out of the shop I just began playing with it in my hands cause I didnt know what else you were supposed to do with it ; I also marvelled ( and laughed my head off) at how I had actually managed to acquire this gum.", "We walked into a shop that we just couldnt understand; it had a whole lot of interestig-looking stuff with people looking very interested in everything, so we tried to look interested but simply couldnt. So we walked out and just strolled around feeling like we were about to explode with energy any second, every now and then closing eyes to see everything rushing towards us and expecting (and wanting ) to be swallowed up by the ground at any moment. We went into a bookstore which had the most unbelievably brightly coloured magazines, toys, books, stationery, floor, ceiling , shelves, etc. I saw other people looking interested in the things people are normally interested in looking at, like magazines and cd's , so I tried to do the same to look a bit normal; but trying to concentrate on anything just made me more inclined to stare at the stupidest things, like blank paper, pencils, etc.", "We sat on a bench in the middle of the complex where we could just watch evereything happening around us. I said to Dave that it looked like people were all walking leaning to the side, so he told me that he could tell what type of people they were by the way they walked. ", "After a bit more walking around feeling very amused with ourselves, we decided to go out to the car to get the dope that was waiting for us. On the way to the parking lot I remembered the gum, so we proceedede to stuff our mouths with the stuff ...a thoroughly satisfying experience. Once inside the car Dave noticed that same bitch of a security guard staring at us from some distance, so we just remained calm and chilled out for a while, enjoying the gum and the pictures behind our closed eyes. After a while we got out adn opened the boot to get the joints... we were planning on goin for a walk towards a darker area so that we could smoke them without being seen, but at this moment there were still a few too many peolpe around so we sat in the front of the car again chewing furiously on the gum and laughing and carrying on like complete loonies. ", "Eventually we couldn't contain oursselves any longer - we just *had* to smoke. So we decided that we would walk to the exit of the parking lot and along the road that lead out of there towards Sea Point (a suburb) - this was a dark and quiet road and we thought it would be okay to smoke as we walked along. Before we got out of the car, I was agonizing over what to do with my gum, cause I didnt want to smoke with it ins my mouth but it was so good that I had to save it for later; so I was immensely pleased with myself when I left this huge glob perched on top of the steering wheel.", "We got out of the car with our joints in our pockets and went round to the back to put something (can't remember what) in the boot. As we were getting ready to close the boot and move on, I noticed a police van drive slowly past... it then stopped almost directly opposite us and when I looked at the driver our eyes locked in one terrifying moment. We started walking away and I saw out of the corner of my eye the reverse lights of the van come on and it backed slowly after us. I was now panicking . I _knew_ that the cops were now onto us and I was desperate to get away to avoid being arrested for being in possesion of dope. We were going towards the exit of the parking lot now and I couldn't understand why Dave was so calm about all of this - didn't he know that the cops were about to get us? I tried to tell him to head back towards the shopping centre where we could get lost in the crowd, but he was just asking dumb questions about what direction we would take to Sea Point. I realized that it must be the trip thats making me paranoid (this happend on a previous trip - where I became terrified and it turned out to be my imagination ; when I realised this ,the trip turned into one of the best I'd ever had )", "So with difficulty, I followed Dave's lead and continued walking with him. But I couldn't shake this feeling of fear, especially after walking past yet another cop van (although this one was empty)... all the goodness of the trip up to now had been converted into gut-wrenching panic; I was acutely aware that we were being watched - particularly by the police. I heard voices which I sensed were talking about how to get us. As we left the parking lot and started along that dark road I was sure I saw that same van circling the area from which we had just come, and I was expecting it -and other cops - to come and get us at any moment now. I thought about getting rid of the dope now while we still had the chance, but then I saw how cool and collectde Dave looked adn I thought he would think I was silly to waste perfectly good joints. ", "I desperately tried to hang onto the rationallity that seemed to come to Dave so easily, but the more I did so the more I thought about how we were walking straight into a carefully laid trap... I thought about going to prison and my 'normal' friends and the rest ofsociety condemning me; I thought about how I would bring shame to my parents and relatives - and also how I had just blown my chance to continue with the fun , free life I had been living at this time, though this idea seemed insignificant in contast with the shit we were getting ourselves into at this very moment. All this time though there was a slender thread of hope I could still cling to - the knowledge that I was, after all, tripping and I could be compleely freaked out because of that alone.", "This thread of hope disappeared completely when the cop van drove up and stopped beside us. Oh fuck! My heart was pounding. The guy in the van talked to us in a very strange way. He was telling us something about people breaking into cars in the parking lot and he wanted to check if ours was okay. In between sentences he was speaking into his radio saying '... we've got two guys here...' or something like that... I knew that we were being stalled while backup cops were being called. He was asking us where we were going and why we would park our car at the Waterfront if we were going to Sea point. I was glad that Dave was still calm enough to handle the situation. He was acting innocent and seemed to be speaking very sensibly, so I let him do all the talking - later I found out that Dave actually had _no idea_ what was going on cause he was so tripped out - meanwhile I was (even in my petrified state) very impressed and relieved that he was putting on such a good act. Dave suggested we walk back to the parking lot; the cop agreed with this - aparently Dave had the idea all the time that this cop was actually tryig to help! So back we headed ,and what does this dickhead of a cop do? He follows slowly at about 20 metres behind us, headlights watching every movement we make. I was saying to Dave 'how the hell are we going to get rid of this dope?' Despair. We couldn't drop it now - the cop would see. ", "Then Dave turned round and stopped walking. By this time he had also become suspicious but luckily wasnt nearly as freaked out as I was. The fucking bastard then sped up to us so quickly and stppped so close that he almost knocked us down. He told us to hop in and as he rolled slowly by and I realised that we would be heading straight back in his van I took the opportuniy to slip th ejoint out of my pocket and let it fall silently to the ground. Walking round the back of the van to the passenger side I noticed with horror that Dave hadn't yet got rid of his. I whispered loudly 'drop it, drop it!' and just before he climbed in the van he too had flicked away the joint.", "We sped quickly back to the parking lot where the cop dropped us off ,only to be greeted by another one of the jerks. This one also began asking stupid questions and trying to get us to give ourselves away by not knowing where 'our' car was - meantime the first idiot had dropped us in a parking lot with hundreds of cars; it would take anyone a few moments to get their bearings and work out were they had parked. At first I was babbling incoherently back at this second cop, fully aware that he would think I was acting very suspiciously, but then I thought: now wait a minute! we're safe now. Fuck the stupid cop. I angrily showed him the keys which I took from my pocket (unfortunately I didnt have the wit at that moment to also tell him to shove his head up his ass) and went to the car - which Dave had now found - an loudly demonstrated how the key fitted the lock perfectly.", "At this point I noticed with disbelief that the lump of gum I had left on the steering wheel was gone ; I was now *convinced* that while the cops had happily kept us stalled out on that dark road, they were busy searching our car for drugs. I was shocked and relieved that we had in fact had the dope with us out there and not left it in the car... it turned out , however, that this whole idea was just fantasy (the gum had dropped to the floor of the car) but this idea did contribute to the rush of thoughts and contemplation I had a short while later while we were sitting down outside the shopping centre again trying to get over this ordeal.", "What I thought about and discussed with Dave, while I awas physically shaking and feeling very nervous and fragile, was how it is so crazy and unfair that the police and society consider us to be criminals - I mean , if someone asks me if I have comted a crime I'll say no, but according to the law I should have been put in jail long ago. Why is it that taking drugs is offensive when it harms no one (not even the user, if he is not stupid about it) ; if I was in another group of friends I might have been into drinking gallons of beer. But of course this is _fine_, and even encouraged in society! And then theres the police. It seems that they are just out to harass us; when they were watching us in that parking lot they just decided that two young guys just having fun must be up to something that posed a danger to society! Yeah, right!", "Anyway , all this thinking was getting me extremely distressed, so we went to the CD store and listened to some music through headphones to try to get ourselves up again. Somehow Dave managed to get his trip gooing well again but when I closed my eyes while listening to the music I saw frightening images of people all around me watching me and I could sense their suspicion ofme. The music did help slightly, not by relaxing me, but by giving me a sense of familiarity, of something I knew and liked. I felt a little more comforable.", "When we left that store all remaining traces of my trp, except for a feeling of nervousness, vanished. Dave was still having a good time - the experience had obviously not affeced him as harshly as it had affected me - which made me feel more and more pissed off, as the evening wore on , that the cops had done me out of a perfectly good trip.", "Well, thats the end of this story... right now it is perhaps too soon after this experience to have learnt anything from it; I am still feeling really resentful and feel that I have an unfinished trip that I have to make up sometime. I won't go on preaching my views now... you can take what message you will from this story.", "Having done my share of LSD, I spose I should add my two bits to the heap. I have had over half a dozen sessions with acid, ranging over about 5 years. I have ingested roughly 10 blotter hits in this time. The last time I dropped was Dec 15 (or friday, whichever the date was), and second last was Dec 30 1987. Most recently, I started with 1 blotter at 7:39 am, took a second at 8:45, and a third at 4:00 pm. By 9:00 am the liquid skin disease had kicked in, and the metallic sweats came and there were indications of activity. By 10am mental activities were real white-waterish, if ya know what I mean. It was very pleasant. By noon I was really riding high. After the 4:00 booster, the effect was even more profound. By this time I had taken just below 3 blotter units. Acid insights galore, along with the laughter caused by profoundly realized revelations and humorous social-cultural reflections. Asleep by 3am, my girlfriend and I had a delightful, close, 'bonding' evening such as the effects were so wonderful.", "With me, acid can make me devilishly-mischievous, meditatively reflectful, probingly thoughtful, reflective, serene, joyful, intensely happy, radiant of love....it tends to enhance my understanding of the cosmos. It is a way to travel to reality-prime, where things are not exactly as they appear, and things are really eternal and ordered, assuring. It is a soulful drug, a mind/spirit/soul amplifier of perception, not a body drug like the legals. It allows 'the doors of perception' to be cleansed, it reminds you you are eternal. I once feared LSD cause I thought it would take 'me' away, it would destroy 'me'. Now I know personality is indestructable, at least for those who have found 'identification'. While everything changes, 'I' will remain. Those who have done lsd may suspect it is illegal because it causes thought processes that may threaten consensus reality power, it does not promote their 'authority'. LSD is a long strange journey where you walk with yourself and get to know who you really are.", "I've had some really wonderful trips, and have learned quite a lot from this chemical. Its perspective cannot be wrong, just different. How many times has it been said or implied lsd drives you crazy? Are the Beatles crazy? They have done more, and better, LSD than I ever will. Didn't Rock Hudson (or was it Cary Grant) use it? Didn't the CIA? Why must scare tactics be used to squash anything the gov/power-structre doesn't like? Informed, intelligent adults should have the powers of choice, including choice of chemicals. This current prohibition will be no more successful than the last one, in its stated purpose. It has been very successful in its real purpose. Freedoms must be taken if the WoD is to work, and the typical person is too afraid to stand up and question or comment. Places like this are indespensible resources for dissemination of the real truth, and the real news. I thank NetGod that I need not depend upon the TV for news, or our local slanted rag.", "While I admit a slight possiblity of having a 'bad trip' on acid, this has never happened to me. I do see how one could have a displeasurable encounter with lsd if", "But I think all the krap about emergency room bad trips is exaggerated, dark-age hyperbole. And last time I dropped I looked out my 4 story window, not jumped. LSD's LD50 is evidence that it is no harmful to the body than water is. It is beneficial to the mind and soul when used properly. It simply changes your perspective, shifts your dimensions a bit. Like Alice down the rabbit hole, its a strange, but fun and stimulating adventure.", "It's not like I do it everyday. It's been YEARS since I did it before just recently. And thats fine with me. I was celebrating a 4.00 average for this term in school, and thats for Comp Sci, Math, University Honors and some history courses, not basket weaving. My cums up to 3.54 so I am sitting pretty at school, and work for those who would assume otherwise. Which goes to point out the ole 'amotivational syndrome' is a load of myth also.", "Probably the worse thing about this latest War on Drugs is that it is at best, a hypocritical witch-hunt based on misinformation and one sided propaganda. It is against information, and informed-formation. It would crush those who would excercise their legal rights in the name of the law. It would put the Law over the Individual, a corrupt and unjust law. It demands uniformity of posture and mind, rather than unity in diversity. The Drug Warriors assume Judgment as their own, rather than taking stock in tolerance and freedom. As with the Amercian flag, the symbol has become far more important than that which it represnts. And this is a mistake, a grave and fatal error plagueing democracy --- that the citizenry will be 'taken care of', and then controlled. Legislation can never produce moral change, or anything like meaningful growth. Only personal exerience can teach the lessons of life; laws cannot make one good regardless of number, severity, or penalty. Heaven must be something like a self-governed anarchy, with no laws carved in stone, except 'to thine own self be true', and 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you'. Tolerance IS necessary for growth, laws should be to protect the responsible from the animal-people, not to restrict free movement of freewill citizens. Intolerance is indicative of narrowness, and prejudice. Ignorance and prejudice stand in the way of growth, they are unbecoming of those who would learn, and learn to know. (german: kennenlernen) One day perhaps we will pass out of the era of negative, forbidding laws to a system of positive, helpful laws, the Law of Love. When you love every other person as you can love yourself, and when you seek to do good to them and to do good for them, you will see that this is the best rule to run your life by. Laws (rules of behavior or patterns of response) are every persons duty to legislate for himself. Make the real rules for yourself; find your own moral code and live by it, and be true to yourself. If you find yourself fully self-accountable, you need not fear the trials or the scrutiny of tyranny. A truly self-assured soul need not fear worldly troubles, for the citadel of the spirit is ever unassailable. Drugs or not, find yourself and be yourself, and be yourself fully and unwaveringly, certain of the Truth you increasingly live.", "One day last summer, my girlfriend and I decided to take some green gel tabs.  My girlfriend, who is only 4'9' and 90lbs, and I (5'3' 107 lbs) had no idea how potent this stuff was.  ", "Our first mistake was taking a dosage that was too high for our body weights and level of experience.  We had both tripped previously but only on 1 hit and it wasn't that strong.", "Our second mistake was taking it on a Saturday morning on our way to an acquaintence's house, which we had only met several weeks prior to our usage.", "When we arrived we still weren't really feeling it, but after about an hour, I looked at my girlfriend and she started freaking out.  I looked at her and all of the sudden I started feeling the trip too.  It hit really fast and really hard.  She started crying.  She wouldn't or couldn't talk.  So I asked her if she wanted to leave the place that we were, even though I know how dangerous it is to drive, but we had to get out of there.", "I didn't want to be driving so I tried to think of the most comfortable, closest place we could go.  We went to my good friend Sue's house who lived nearby.  This was the best thing I could have done.", "Although I had never had any experience with anyone having a bad trip...I seemed to understand where my friend was at.  If I didn't talk myself down, I would slip into the terrified state that she was in.", "After we got to my friends house, I held my girlfriend and just talked soothingly to her.  I reminded her that we were just tripping and that this feeling would end.  I told her that if she concentrated, she could pull herself out of it.  After about 2 hours of consoling her...she finally came out of it.  If I hadn't had to work so hard on consoling her...I would have probably started wigging out too.  I couldn't sleep for about 32 hours from the time I took the acid.", "Now you would think that we learned our lesson about experimenting with psychedelic drugs but about a year later, we decided to do some shrooms.  Now she had done them before but I never had.", "I bought some from a very close friend of mine.  I told him about her bad acid trip and asked him approximately how much shrooms we should take given our previous experience.  He told me that 1/2 of an eighth would be good for both of us.  Well, he was way off...because I took only the caps from 1/2 of an eighth and that was a little too much.", "We took them on a Sunday morning because neither one of us had to work the next day.  We were watching Behind the Music on VH1.  For some reason I couldn't stand watching TV.  It was mentally disturbing to me so I decided to take a shower and get dressed so that we could go do something.  Well, I couldn't stand in the shower because my legs felt like cement.  My girlfriend and I took a hot bath instead.  It felt so good.  We sat in there for about an hour and watched our kittens play.  That was the best part of the experience.  After we finally got out...I didn't have the ability to get dressed so we just layed on our bed.  All kinds of strange and demented thoughts went through my head.  I started questioning who I was and my relationships with my girlfriend and my parents.  Things felt really depressing to me.  I am a lesbian and I started questioning if I was making the right choices.  It's hard to explain but I started to feel trapped in my life.", "After about a 1/2 hour which felt longer than the rest of the entire day, some friends of mine stopped over.  That pulled me out of the depression.  After getting a horrible sleep that night, the affects finally wore off.", "I will never touch any psychedelic drugs again.  Not because I had a horrible trip...but because it seems to bring too intense of a feeling and the depression lasted a couple of days after the intitial trips.", "This is a little bit more than a description of my trip. It has to do with how acid has irrepairably ruined my life, i'm not saying I wont do acid again, but I am saying my school, my family, and my friends have all been effected by the actions and choices I made while under the influence of lsd, please take the time if you have it, to read this so you do not make similiar choices resulting in shattering your relationships with many parts of your life.", "It started off as a normal day at school, I had been invited to go over to my friend Eric's house to drop some acid. I have taken LSD many times before, with moderation of course, regardless of how much some of my friends take it.", "Recently I have been trying very hard to get some structure into my life with minimal success, I have been depressed, tired, and unmotivated for about a year now, telling myself that my drug habits are a means of self-medication, but I know the truth, i'm just a burn-out and have nothing better to do than quest after an 'altered state of mind'.", "I normally don't drop acid when I have to be home talking to my father (parents are divorced) at most 4 hours after I take the acid, but I have been going through alot of stress, and felt that this would be a way to release it, even though I was just looking for an excuse for myself to rationalize my behavior. My father is 45, and one of those 'Learn from the lessons I never had the chance to' parents, and a former Hardcore Junkie/Alcoholic 8 years sober. So, he isn't very understanding of my exploration of drug use, which he feels I wont grow out of.", "We dropped the acid at about 3:15 PM. Eric turned on Grand Turismo 2, and we played it. 30 mins had passed, and I was feeling the first wave of the acid. I thought to myself, 'This is remarkable...' because that is amazingly fast by the normal standards of the acid I get.", "At around 4:00, I was feeling quite comfortable and could not take my eyes off of the ceiling, and it's popcorn pattern. It kept on waving back and forth, and breathing at the same time. Then Eric got up to go to the bathroom, and behind him were several trails all doing something different than he was doing seconds before. One would have it's hand behind his head and his other arm aiming up, and another would be hunched over, all of this coming from him casually walking to the bathroom. I thought to myself, this is some good acid.", "When he got back in what seemed like hours later, he came, not out of the bathroom, but out of the hallway on the other side of the house, wearing a Jason (from Friday the 13th) mask. He looked at me pulled a knife out of his pocket, and said, 'Is this scary?' I looked at him, and laughed, all at the same time over-anylizing this strange occurance, Why would he attempt to scare me after giving me acid? So I said, 'Ummm, dude... what the hell are you doing?' he responded with, 'I was just trying to scare you man. Hey do I look like a retard yet?,' keep in mind, Eric is very unexperienced with Psycedelics, and he thinks that there is certain acid that makes people look like retards. So I just looked at him, and agreed, and said, 'More than you know, Eric, more than you know.'", "It was getting around 5:00 when he took me out to the bus stop so I could get home, and at this bus stop, there was this 3 foot tall oriental man with a head bigger than a watermelon, (and I can confirm this because I see him everyday at the bus station on my way to school) holding a garbage bag. He was walking around picking up cans, and there was also this rather 'large' woman sitting next to me. He walked over to her and handed her the bag. I was hearing strange noises from the woman's stomache, and they were being warped in my head, I was hearing Ickbay, Ickick, Iiickbaay. Then all of the sudden, the oriental man, said something like Maui Wowie (that's not what he said, but that's what I perceived it as, and they were echoing and warping, which then came off as Mawaui... My mind was frazzled, I started making completely irrational associations. That these two had some sort of connection. That this has been going on for thousands of years, and that one cannot function without the other. Then my inner monologue started going over this. 'Ickbay Mawaui, it's as if it is... and has always been this way.'", "The the bus showed up at 5:15. I sat in the far back, left seat and next to me was a woman, and her child that wouldn't stop moving around and whining. This came as quite a disturbance to me, I did not understand why the child was whining, and I knew that this was a 15 minute bus ride, Could I endure the madness for 15 minutes with out screaming? Was it really all that much if I were to ask the child to refrain from whining? But no, I held back, I knew I could not speak to these 'people' on any normal level of communication. ", "I pulled out my watch, 5:16, 'Damnit,' I muttered, the word echoed in my head, and I looked around all of the sudden on edge... Did they hear me? This gave me a short break from the unrelentless whines from the child. As time passed, I found ease in looking out the window and soon, we were at the bus station. I was about to go to smoke a cigarette, when I saw my good friends Ryan and Alley waiting to catch a bus that I can catch to get home that was leaving right then, So I walked over to them. Ryan greeted me with a simple but convenient, 'Hello', as did Alley, and they knew something was up when I didn't respond right away, I had to look around, and the whispered, 'H ii', Ryan asked what I had said, and I shook my head No.", "The three of us got on the bus, which was a very unusual and awkward experience, as bus rides while frying usually are, each window on the bus had it's own point to it. Every window was it's own direction all in this bus that moments before outside of it, was a rectangle. We sat down next to each other, Alley in my seat, and Ryan in front on me. I finally got up the courage to speak, I asked Ryan for a cigarette, he said, 'I only have 2, but i'll give you 2/3rds of a whole one once I smoke half of one tonight.' I was confused, and my face showed that, he said, i'm just fucking with you, here' and handed me one. He said in a casual voice, 'Dude, you look baked.' Alley followed that up with, 'Yea man, you look out of it, you got a bowl?' I shook my head no, and said, 'It's not weed i'm on, it's acid.' She said, 'Really? Are you getting some good visuals?' I shook my head yes. At this point I was experiencing quite a few auditory hallucinations, and it was hard to maintain in front of the other people on the bus, and then Ryan and Alley had this big discussion about weed, right there. I felt so uncomfortable, because I didn't know if this was actually going on or not. Then I saw the gas station that always indicates for me to pull the string to get off the bus. I said 'See you later Alley, later Ryan.'", "From here on, it was basically a ten minute walk home, and I was in a very animated world at the moment, it was perfectly light out. So I smoked my cigarette, the only one i've had all day, i'm cutting back. Which is one of my reason for stress. I started looking around, and things were begining to slowly, but surely take on a purple-ish tint, or a dull but at the same time bright green. I didn't understand what was going on. Then I saw a street light flicker on and off shooting sparks down. I then realised, I can't go home like this. So I for some reason, walked around my neighborhood stumbling, and then found a spot to sit where I could watch the train tracks. Things were not normal. I knew that if I went home right now, i'd be fucked. But I knew that if I went home later, I'd be worse off, so I tried for a while to get my head straight to come up with some logical reason as to why I was frying on acid and where I was, but with minimal success. So I went home to let things 'happen' and they did. My dad started off with, 'Where have you been,?' I responded with, 'At Eric's,' he said, 'No you haven't been! I talked to his mother, and she said you haven't been over there once. Now damnit son, tell me where you have been, you look loaded,' I was a bit confused, but at the same time I knew what had happened, Eric decided that he'd just tell his mom that noone had even been there. I decided that I would act stupid, and say I don't know where I was, and respond I don't know to any and all questions. He said, 'Son, you look loaded.' I responded with, 'I'm perfectly willing to admit that, I think i've been dosed.' Then he took on a concerned look. 'With what?' he asked, I said 'LSD'. He asked how I knew that it was lsd, and I said 'From what i've heard about it, it sound like lsd' he proceed with a line of questioning, 'When did you start feeling it?', 'at school', 'why didn't you tell a teacher?' 'Are you fucking crazy? They'd kick me out!' 'Why didn't you come home?' 'I don't know' 'Where were you?' 'I don't know' 'Are you sure it's lsd?' 'Yes' 'How? Have you ever done lsd?' 'No' Then he called up the hospital, and we drove to the ER, and they took my blood pressure, and had me do a series of tests, but never gave me anything like pills, or injected me with anything. I sat there for hours until it wore off, then we went home. My dad was less than amused.", "The next day, my dad called up my school, and got them involved. The teachers didn't believe me, then, they had to make the announcement that investigation will begin on the matter. Basically meaning, my friends' privacy will be invaded for quite a while, and noone knew at that point who the kid who got 'dosed' was. But the lack of discreteness by the teachers pissed me off, by the end of the day, everyone knew who it was.", "Since I wasn't believed, the teachers said, 'You don't mind if we do a little urine test now do we? Because, we can see how you could make the jump from smoking weed to, oh say, dropping tabs of acid.' I said 'Sure, go right ahead,' attempting to call their bluff because I know how the teachers work. And then they started giving my dad number to the local clinics and places that they run urinalysis screenings. Since i've taken MDMA, Mushrooms, DXM, not to mention smoked a fairly large amount of weed from the previous saturday to this sunday, every day. I was getting a bit worried. Then they asked me when the last time I smoked weed was, I said, I don't smoke weed anymore sticking to my story, because if I lied about the weed, I could very well be lying about the acid. Me and my dad got in the car to drive to the drug testing place, and then, half way there, I cracked... I told my dad that the last time I smoked weed was over christmas break nearly a month ago. He said that we should head back to the school and tell the teachers this, so I did, and the teacher said. Ok, now, I still thiink you should get the UA, I think you are lying. So I took the UA, and I had drank alot mountain dew the past few days so that must have lowered it some, but the number I heard from my dad, is around 300, don't know much about this, but that is supposedly high. But at least my dad doesn't know much either, so, I was able to convince him that I had smoked alot of pot a month earlier.", "All in all, what this experience effected in my life is, My family, They wont be able to look at me the same way ever again. My school, my teachers will now forever 'Have it out for me'. My Friends, their privacy is being invaded in an investigation, and they know exactly who to blame. Mostly, i'm worried about my life. I hope that in some way someone can benifit from this, to not bring school into an excuse when dealing with drugs.", "I dropped 1 tab, basically had a very sketchy bad trip.  The next morning I woke up and everything was a little flashy and i thought it would go away but it didn't.", "I have had it for 8 months know and I often find myself trying to peer through the weirdness but i never can. I call it the 'CONFUSION' because it is very unpleasant especially at the age of 15. To tell the truth I really hate it and wish I could reverse to the day I took it and get pissed instead.", "I'm in 8th grade, and at school, my friend said he had some acid. So I decided I should take some. I bought a hit on a sweet-tart for five bucks. I took it in 2nd period. I didnt think it would fuck me up too bad, but then again, I was naive about drugs then. In 20 minutes, it wasn't working so I bought another hit. It was double-dropped. I took it and licked the tin-foil it came in. By the beginning of 3rd period, about 45 minutes later, I was really starting to notice the effects. I was looking at the walls of the classroom and the posters on it were moving. I was like, 'Whoa, this must be the peak.' Man, was I WRONG! It kept getting more and more intense throughout 3rd period, and I lost most coordination and noticed that I was numb. I was like, 'Damn, this is stronger than I thought.' Then, when I moved onto 4th period, it hit me HARD! Colors were moving on the walls and everything looked strobed. I found it hard to navigate my way around the hall when everything looks like a strobe-effect. I looked at my friend, who was aware of my tripping, and he looked like he was made of paper. I started to panic. ", "Everything changed at this point to terrifying and threatening forms. My friend told me to relax and enjoy it, because feelings are amplified on acid. I went to the 4th period classroom. I was so scared still that I began to pray to God to make it stop. I didnt think he heard me so I wrote it down on my homework - 'God, end the trip'. But I finally chilled. I sat down and relaxed. Everything look so strange. I got out last year's yearbook and talked to the pictures of everybody. But I still was anxious. Everytime i would panic, i would tell myself that it was only the LSD and that it would end soon. Then I went to lunch. Now, the cafeteria was moving and spinning. Colors were everywhere! I was in awe. I didnt eat much, wasn't hungry. It had been about 2 hours since the effects had kicked in, and I was still tripping hard. ", "Now all this was pretty hard on me psychologically, because I was only thirteen, but I still kept on enjoying. Walking was extremely difficult, as was talking. The effects began to taper off at 5th period. I was still dizzy and coordination was difficult, but I could control myself. At the end of the day, I was straight by the time my mom came to pick me up from school. Ever since then, I have been using numerous drugs at school, from Ketamine to OxyContins to Speed to Pot to X. I feel that school is the coolest place to be high, and I enjoy the challenge of keeping my fucked-upness a secret from teachers. hehe.", "Chair and I were at a barter faire in Eastern Washington, and we were enjoying the festive air of the place.  There were many people with booths full of goods to trade or sell set up along many straw-covered pathways.  People came from miles around to attend this fair gathering, and there was a lot to do.  So we set about obtaining some LSD.  It's not always easy to walk through a crowd of people not knowing if they're government agents or not, but we wandered through the late sun and located a man with an interesting shirt who offered liquid doses for $2 apiece.  We agreed, and decided that 5 drops would be a reasonable number for us each.  We knelt before him as though he were Queen Elizabeth and we were being knighted.  The drops that came from the little Sweet Breath bottle had a slight minty taste, but I'm sure our breath was sweeter for it.  We thanked and paid him.", "We were walking along with a set of bamboo Unklungs, which is an Indonesian instrument.  It consists of a hanger, with eight separate and removable instruments, each a different note on the scale.  Each of the eight handheld pieces is basically a frame with two bamboo cylinders that vibrate and make a noise when shaken.  There is a Primus song that uses these instruments (I think - it sure as hell sounds like it, but I've never checked the liner notes to know for sure) and it's track 8 on Pork Soda, if you want to know what they sound like, regardless of whether that's what they use or not.  We found a vendor with several glass pieces, and we worked out a trade for a foot-and-a-half bong.  The bong was the nicest piece the vendor had, and it would have sold for more than a hundred dollars at a head shop.  At the barter faire, it would have cost $50 to $70. The bong was predominantly blue, marbled through with green and orange and white.  It's absolutely beautiful, and thicker than any other bong I've seen.  It's still intact after being battered countless times, a year later.", "We had also obtained several types of beautiful buds (Mango, Pez, G-13, Smiley, Purple Star, and some White Russian we'd brought along) and we decided to go back to our tent and take some icy bong hits out of our new bong. We had brought a cooler full of ice for just this purpose.  Our tent was set up on top of a hill, overlooking the entire barter faire in all its glory.  The place was full of people - it looked like a temporary city had been erected in the middle of a desert.  There was a constant stream of incoming cars.  There were drums beating in the distance, and the happy cries of the delighted participants of the faire.", "We sat at the edge of our tent, taking bong hits and trying to decide which of our six varieties of weed we liked the best.  We watched the people from our hill, and sat and talked until we felt the acid coming on.  The body high was apparent rather soon, and it was very good.  The euphoria intensified gradually but surely, and we decided to descend back into the strange land of the people.", "We wandered through the aisles aimlessly, marveling at all the people.  The visuals began to kick in, and we were laughing and holding each other.  Many of the people stared, but they were not worried.  There were shops with huge shelves of multi-colored candles, and obviously those were interesting to look at.  We could smell the world, and all the strange herbs and foods.  As dusk slowly rolled in, we saw many fire circles being formed.  There would be a circle of hay bales and a fire in the middle.  A lot of smoking went on in these circles, as we soon learned.", "We sat at one fire circle in front of a booth where energy drinks were sold.  There was a giant tye-dyed mushroom tapestry stretched out above the shop, which is why we chose it out of all the other fire circles.  We sat down, marveling at the complexity of the hay bales, when the people already sitting there asked the circle if anyone had a pipe.  We happily procured a lovely glass piece, and to our amazement it was loaded with an amount of weed that it was never designed to hold.  The pipe was passed around a few times, and then reloaded to the same bountiful level.  The circle had broken up a bit, and after two hits, our happy pipe-loaders decided to go strolling, leaving us with this heaping bowl.  We smoked it, and then new people came to sit.  Seeing us with a smoking pipe, they offered to load some.  The fire was warm, and we were giggly and happy to the point of being stupefied.  There was no way to express the all-encompassing sense of happiness, giddiness, joy of life and sight and sound and creation.  These people with their generous weed-sharing ways were just small examples of the glory and bounty of this barter faire.  We were all one, all happy and all sharing in the beauty and warmth of the communal fire.", "Chair and I decided to explore this Nirvana further, and reluctantly left the circle of never-ending smoke.  It was soon forgotten, for the acid was triggering such euphoria and intense happiness that nothing could be regretted.  We gazed in astonishment at the people, each face a shifting psyche wanting to connect to us.  There were women with bells, and I excitedly pointed these out to Chair.  It was nightfall, and we ended up at the central fire, the massive, drum-surrounded heart of the barter faire.  The drums took our breath away - there was a community of drummers harmonizing and any one of the drummers could take the beat to a new level.  There had to be at least thirty drums going at once.  The people were dancing and laughing and blissfully gliding through each other.", "On our way back through, we stopped to catch the end of two fire-dancing women, and then the belly dancers came out.  They were beautiful, seductively instructing us in just how a body could flow like water, or take on a serpentine elegance of writhing and weaving and breathing together.  After that ended, we found a giant swing set in a less populated part of the whole affair, and began swinging and kicking our legs.  When we looked up at the stars, it was insane.  The stars - the whole sky - looked as though it were being stirred with an invisible spoon, like cookie dough and the stars were the chocolate chips.  But it was far more spectacular than that - the colors were so vibrant, and the stars seemed to wrap and undulate through each other as they swirled and sashayed through the deep blue night.  It was incredible.  The air even tasted better - we were so alive, all of our senses turned on to 'Divine Reception.'", "We made it up to our tent, although unfortunately, I thought the ground below was wriggling with rattle snakes.  Chair fortunately was not deluded by the ground, and we successfully planted ourselves in front of our tent again.  This time the lights were all turned on, as it was dark, and that was a whole new dimension, seeing the lights from above.  The stream of cars was still snaking through the hills, and the tent city of desert dwellers was swelling.  I zeroed in on a particular truck with a little camper, and watched it bumping along.  When the truck hit a particularly large bump, the back end dipped down, and the corner of it spiraled down and swirled to mix with the dirt.  I explained this to Chair, who laughed.  ", "The whole place was vibrating and throbbing, and howls went up from around the camp.  I howled back, eliciting more howls in return.  This went on for a long time, throughout the night.  Chair and I went into the tent and laid together.  When I touched his hair, my fingers came away dripping with the rich darkness.  I could dip my finger into the puddle of his hair and pull it away, stretching long pieces of it out like taffy, even though I wasn't actually holding his hair.  I got an image of hundreds of eyes, and purple shafts of light shot out of the pupils of each in unison, shortly before a charcoal bullet was released from the same place.  Chair was lying right next to me, and one of his eyes kept disappearing.  His face was melting into the pillow, so I tried to keep his head up, but every time he put it back down, it would start melding with the pillow.", "Our conversation was about the true freedom we all need, and this, for just this short while, was that freedom.  In our glorious, infatuated, excessive bliss, we began singing 'Get Up, Stand Up' by Bob Marley, emphasizing 'So now you see the light...' for we'd never felt so unrestricted or truly happy.", "The next day, someone gave us an eighth of mushrooms.  The man camping next to us came over for a while to talk, and discovering that we'd purchased four hits of blue Felix paper acid, he offered to dose us from his vial.  We told him we were saving it for when we got home, so he put a total of twelve drops on some chips which we sealed up.  Then a man camped on a slope near our hill informed us that he'd been robbed, and since he was so upset, he wanted to smoke.  In return, he gave us a six-foot bong.  There were also some sugar cubes scattered on the ground from the bastard thieves' raid, and he told us that half of the cubes had been dosed and half had not.  He had been picking them up and eating them, and was quite fucked up.  He referred to the bong he gave us as a ten-foot bong, and had gotten scabs all over his face from who knows what.  He was barely coherent, but he enjoyed smoking, and it calmed him down.", "Later, before we left, another nearby camper smoked us out heavily and we traded a small bud of White Russian for a luscious, fresh, glittering green bud of Pez (that's where we'd gotten the Pez from earlier, too.)  The bud he gave us was easily four times as big as the one we gave him.  Everyone there was so generous, so wonderful - the experience was the single most happy event of my life (and Chair's) - until we took the chips that had been dosed when we were back at home.", "My journey with LSD began at the tender age of 13. I had smoked weed, indulged in inhalents, alcohol, and mushrooms by that time, but I had no idea what I was in for. I had (and have) never loved or been as fascinated with a drug as I was with Lady LSD. From the very first time she flowed through my veins I was in love. That piece of me that had always been missing was filled.", "The first that I went sailing down the tunnel was in December of 1999. I don't remember the experience very well, but as my friends bathroom span around in circles heading towards the bottom, I went with it. During that acid trip I did not open any doors or hit the bottom of a tunnel that is similar to a castles tower. But as always I popped up near the end, with only vague memories of what had happened. Vague memories of everything spinning and an upstairs room. This was on 16 hits of paper. ", "During the summer of 2000 I was almost invincible to acid. I knew what the fuck I was doing. I knew the hallways almost too well. I knew which doors to open and I knew the secret to controlling acid. And that is: NEVER FORGET THAT YOU ARE JUST ON ACID! It is simply chemicals reacting in your brain. One of my mottos is never to forget. A person can go very far into the buroughs of their minds with this information. Not to mention it is a very handy skill to have in social situations as well as realationships.", "It was a weekend that I will never forget. I was on at least 30 hits of acid. A combination of two different papers and a vial of Lavender acid. The night before had been a pill of E, opium, and seven hits of acid. My friend who had just suffered a traumatizing E experience had run away from home and was looking for the answers to everything. He was absolutely convinced that the only way to find answers was to take more acid. This led to his demise. I realized this as we stood on the shores of the Pacific Ocean at five am. Later that day he claimed he was god and began crying without his knowledge.", "A few days later he was in a mental institution. He was released and is looking forward to doing acid again. But this experience did not hinder my acid usage. Neither did watching a guy who could not remember his own name because he had taken twelve hits of some amazing liquid and one in the eye. I helped him out of a tunnel. According to him I had been sent from god. ", "Regardless to all of this happening in a two week streach, I did a washout two weeks after my friend was admitted into a mental hospital. A washout is an empty vial filled 3/4 of the way with whiskey, preferably vodka. Shake it for a minute, drink it, then cut the vial in half, suck on the pieces, and the cap. Wahla. It will take you beyond, around the bend, and maybe back. It all depends on what you do with your crispy creams (your mind).", "This was my second adventure down the tunnel. I fell down it. As I fell I laughed at myself. 'Ha ha ha ha ha. You did this to yourself.' I was suddenly a book and had closed. I had been locked closed like a diary that can be purchesed at Save-On. I knew I had gone to the end of the tunnel. But what was in the middle of it? 'How did I get to this upstairs room in my mind?' I pondered. The house is dark and Victorian with a tower. The upstairs room is painted blue. The transportation around the house is by row boat. There is a room where I am a wall and I play ping-pong with my psycologist, who incedently also is a wall. There is a room with gears. This room is very frightening. It is how I imagine hell to be. I can feel gears moving. My organs spinning around my body. I can feel my blood pumping through my veins. I can feel my heart slipping out from in between my lungs. In my mind the words, 'It'll be okay, it't just acid' plays over and over and over again. I refused to forget the cannel where the boats stop and rest. I jump into another boat and go to another room. As I went to sleep I thought, 'I cannot forget this, because this is acid.'", "But when I woke up the next morning, I could not get back so easily. 'This is unfair,' I thought. For some twisted reason, I wanted to live there. ", "For the next six months I took part in dropping acid every week for three days at a time. My other drug use had worn down to nothing, but lots of alchol, acid and the ocasional meth, weed, and E. And I am the person who shocked a group of people shitless because I had not tried a certain drug. I can no longer remember which drug it was. By that time if someone had drained the LSD from my system they would have gotten atlest a very potent vial or two. And I was ontop of the world. I was the conducter of singing flowers. ", "Febuary 2001. 1 pill of E and 18 hits of acid in approximately 24 hours. I was wondering around a rave listening to a girl who was talking about her father. He just so happened to be a pedaphile. All I was thinking was, 'God don't allow me to explode.' 12 hours later I somehow found myself bird watching, drinking Scoresby, and playing in the snow. How I got there is a story all of it's own. ", "It was the night of my wedding to my wife, Candy Flipper. We had shared a washout of our vial and then shared the washout of friends vial. If there is nothing else that I have learned during my time with acid is that it is not good to mix different kinds together and no matter what anyone says, I promise there is a peak. The evening began with our wedding in her bathroom and then dancing to the Beatles in my parents home. We later joined eight friends who were also under the influence of LSD. My wife and I being the acidheads of this collection of people. None of these individuals had ever been able to keep up with our acid sprees. They often shook their heads, some how knowing where they would be if they ever dared to attempt that much lysergic acid diethylamide.", "There were two people getting into a fistfight. One had the looks of a Polish boxer from the 1920's. The other had the looks of an angry Mexican clown taken from a sticker sold at Del Taco. He then warped into a Russian man. We're at the Garden and it's 1927. The Russian man turns into a black man named Boris from 1860's New Orleans. There is a tree, it is 40 feet tall. 'Do not fall on me Mr. Tree,' I say. 'You'd have to run really far to not get his,' my friend says. I move away from this saveage beast for fear of being crushed alive. We decide to go to visit the Sahara. On the way we pet animals that are made from shrubbery. We get chased by cops, and find balloons in trees. My friend goes blind, but with the help of milk his sight is saved. Always use milk when there is too much chlorine in your eyes. The went blind but returned friend then almost gets eaten by a gaint bush with the help of snow and mud.", "Throughout this experience I was sacred shitlesss that I was going to loose my mind, but where would I loose it? My wife had called it earlier. 'We're going to go insane tonight,' she had said. We returned to my friend's garage only to find what I call the center of the earth where the Indian died. I then came up with an elaborate story about how it can only be opened by a Sea World backpack that was sitting on the sofa. I somehow got into a discussion of how this man bought an island and could not pay for it. He was forced to ride his bicycle in a closet because he could not power the island.", "I then took a trip to the center of the earth. I went through the little divot in the concrete and down a segment of tunnels. They looked as the pipes on Mario Party for Nintendo 64. I saw the Indian who had died there and had made it holy. I found where dinosaur bones had been buried by China men, but this was nothing. At the center of the earth is a metal core, the nucleus of a giant cell. Inside is a man riding a bike who is powering all of earth. Allowing her to go round. He was wearing a red Adidas jogging suit and had a 19 foot long beard that he had wrapped around his baldhead. I popped out of this place only to realize that I had opened the door and that I was in Wonderland. And I had also led my wife to the center of the earth. I had documented my journey out loud. Ten minutes later as I listend to a song over and over the most amazing thing occured to me. I had always been there, in Wonderland; I just had refused to see it. This was the last time I did acid. ", "It has now been almost three months. Since then I have fallen down the tunnel while sober and had a very distinct voice living in my mind pop out once. She said, 'You're insane.' The tunnel caved in on me once and I went to Wonderland where green pterodactyls fly. I saw it snow in my bedroom and thought that my bed was covered in ants. They were not ants, they were little men rowing in brown boats with blue oars. I also sometimes feel as though I am moving. Sometimes I wonder if everything that I see might fall away and that I will fall into a white box. I always see transparent things flying in the sky and there a green and pink wallpaper behind everything. These flashbacks ussually show up while I'm sober, but escalate to high altitudes while under the influence of certain drugs.", "After all of this, one might ask if I wish I'd never gone so far or dared to drop at all. I don't regret any of it. I love acid, but it is time for me to put it into a drawer and trip off of what is has left me. I did almost everything imaginable under the influence fo this drug. Got married, raved, jumped on trampolines, went to Disney Land, watched wallpaper, watched a shower floor, climbed trees, went to museums, done cartwheels on the edges of three story buildings, learned to drive stickshift, went to school, swam for eight hours straight, read, and climbed moutains, some of which I fell down. ", "Acid is one of the most beautiful drugs ever disocovered. It was not meant for harm, only to help people. It is not a drug that will turn a person into a junky. It may send a person mad and jumping out of windows seeing white rabbits all over the place, but when you look back, if you're anything like me, you will have found the answer to what ever you were looking for. Whether you knew you were looking or not.", "It will most likely not be in the shape or form that you expected to find it. It may be in the shape of a metaphoric house in your mind or in a lampshade that protects you fromt he werewolves that jump out of mirrors. On acid reality is very difficult to run from. If you try, it will chase after you. Biting at your ankles like wild geesse convinced that you are a loaf of bread.", "I am touched by the stories I've read about LSD, a lot of the bad stories too. I have always wanted to express my feelings about this drug, but there was never a chance to do that in the past (thank those LSD-crazy hippies [not Gore :)] for inventing computers and the internet).", "The first time I tripped is almost a legendary story for me. It happened in Kansas in a trailerhome. I was there as an exchange student. A friend of mine (he later followed the Dead) gave me some acid to keep while he was going on vacation; he said he didn't mind if I took some.", "In Holland (where I come from) it's legal to smoke weed, so my craving for a relaxed drug experience after one year of Kansas skunk (one bud) was getting to me....", "After I cut the trip into pieces (I wanted to build up), I took some pieces and some more.", "DETAIL: In the trailerhome where I lived, were at the time 5 people who had no idea that I was tripping. They thought I had gone to bed and sleep.", "Then the acid kicked in and I passed out. Still after all these years I get flashbacks of what I saw that night.", "Old computer graphics, surreal graphics, cartoons, images from books I read when I was young (a lot).", "After 5 hours I became aware of myself. Before that I didn't even have an idea of anything anymore, only tripping; I discovered that there was a raging thunderstorm outside and I was thinking I was hallucinating those noises ", "When I became aware of myself I started to get a little frightened. I couldn't get in touch with reality anymore and when I looked at my hands I could see the bones right through them and broken glass was cutting into my back.", "At this time I was becoming aware that my cd-player was on repeat (Sisters of Mercy) and that the vibe in this music was getting me down. I turned on the radio and heard the sound come out backwards, turned on other music but everything sounded like shit. I was thinking 'how can I listen to this shit'; in a couple of hours my complete musical tastes changed. My whole collection sucked.", "In a last attempt I put a Jimi Hendrix cd on. The room turned pink and I was home again. I had this same experience with Hendrix a couple years later with 5 tripping friends (always have a Hendrix album in your basement).", "But this was not by far the end of the trip. It was almost 6 in the morning and I had to take a piss. The trailerhome looked like a cubist boat from Picasso. When I entered the room there were claws coming through my curtains. I was shocked, it was too real, this was no mere hallucination. I heard something outside and approached my window. It was our cat, she wanted to come in. I was relieved it was for real, I was sane...only the cat was made of nails, but I knew that it was the trip.", "Now I was coming down but not really - my mind was tired but the trip was raging on. Here came the bad part, I couldn't sleep and was trippng my eyes out.", "I didn't sleep all night and had to act normal all day. How I managed is a riddle; they didn't notice anything but I kept on tripping. In the afternoon I called the dealer in despair. I wanted to know if it would ever stop, and he said that it would (it was the stupidest telephone conversation ever).", "Somehow the trip wore off and I called my girlfriend. We went out and drove to the nicest sunset I have ever seen, it was like paradise after hell.", "I hope when somebody is real deperate on LSD and reads: YOU ARE NOT ALONE, THIS WORLD IS BERSERK, THE FEELING IS GOING AWAY, MAKE FUN WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, he smiles and thinks it's true.... I have done L after this trip and some of the trips were bad and some good (scene, setting, friends).", "It was about 8 months ago and my sister and her friend were talking about acid. I never did any drugs except for mary j. I heard so much cool things about it and wanted to try it if my friend would do it with me which he agreed to do. It was a Friday night and a dude named JJ was going to be at my neighbors house and he was going to have a type of acid called 'baby blues', they were supposed to be better than paper hits of acid. They cost almost twice as much (blotter paper costs $3). We paid and were so excited when we got to my house with the acid we took them, it was about 8 o'clock. We prepared everything so we could have an awsome experience. We bought glowsticks, brought over his blacklight and posters and so forth. I didn't notice anything kicking in after 45 minutes and was getting impatient. We suddenly laid on the ground and stared at the posters laughing, I thought that that was going to be like that for the rest of the trip, it wasn't. After an hour since we took the acid my friend Little D started staring at his hand, he told my to come over there and look at his hand so I did and I noticed what he was talking about. His hand would become horrificly misshapen. It wasn't scary though I was kind of happy that I started to trip. We went to the mirror and looked at ourselves, we were transforming into trolls or something it looked really weird. The whole night everything had something to do with trolls and it felt like we were in a different universe, like a parallel universe or something. I had no track of time.", "It was about midnight I guess when we started playing with glowsticks. My sister and her friend babysat us. They even gave us each a pacifier to chew on (I always need something good to chew on). We turned on my CD player and played all sorts of music, it all sounded really awesome. I could feel the music pass through me. Everything looked 2-D. All of a sudden Little D put in Slipknot. That was just freaky. Everything looked like I was in the desert and every song on that CD is like totally evil when you're trippin. We soon found something else to do but kept the CD player running.", "There is a secret song on that CD if you fast forward to the end of the disk but since we let it play through we didn't even know that the CD player was on because we weren't paying attention. My friend thought there was an evil spirit murderer of some sort trying to kill this little girl who was communicating to us by the radio. Kind of like Poltergeist the movie with that girl and the TV. By now it was early in the morning and we went to sleep. I thought the experience was awesome, I never could get Baby Blue's and I usually have red geltabs (red windowpanes). But I can't even get those anymore and I don't know why. Oh well I will get acid again one of these days and when I do I'm taking alot and it will probably be black geltabs.", "It all started off innocently enough.  I was going to St. George, Utah, to pick up a friend and go to Vegas for a fun filled weekend of smoking weed, cruising the strip, and a Phish concert.  Prior to this trip I had never even considered taking acid.", "Friday morning we left St. George and headed for Vegas.  We smoked some shwag on the way down the canyon and jammed to the Doors, and talked nonsense till we got to Vegas.  When we got to Vegas we met up with some mutual friends, one of which attends UNLV and lives in the dorms, which is where we slept.  Friday night everyone found tickets to the Phish show, so we all went and had an awsome time.", "Saturday morning we woke up late and sat around reminiscing about how cool the concert was.  We all decided we would try to get tickets to the Saturday night show.  Then my friend D pulled out a little bottle and smiled at me.  He asked me if I wanted to do some acid.  It was a very interesting thought, I had never really considered it before.  I had only smoked pot about three times before this trip.  I asked everyone what it was like and about all I could gather from them was that it was 'crazy,' 'intense,' and that I would be a different person after.  I thought for about fifteen minutes and decided to go for it.  D put two drops from the little breath freshener bottle on my tounge.  I rubbed it around my mouth and swallowed.  'That's it?' I asked.  'Thats it,' D said.  The friend I drove down from St. George also took one hit.", "I asked why no one else was doing it and they explained that you develop tolerance and they didn't want to have to do twice as much to get the same effect.  I had no idea the night before that they were all tripping.  At first I had the feeling that nothing was going to happen.  They just told me to hold on and it would work.  About a half hour after taking the acid, things started to happen.  The first effect I noticed was that a blue chair in the room seemed much more blue.  It was strange but not alarming.  Then I laughed my ass off as I watched my friend B roll a joint.  It was so funny that he had these finely tuned 'joint rolling skills.'   Then we set off on what would be the strangest journey of my life.", "As we set off across the parking lot the sun was high and hot, about 1:00 in the afternoon.  I could sense things much better.  I could feel the heat from the pavement and the sun was brighter.", "There was quite a while before the show, so we decided to just chill and walk around the parking lot amongst all the Phish heads.  We picked a nice grassy hill partialy in the shade and by a big 'friendly' rock.  This is when I started to peak.", "I sat among my friends, on a small grassy hill, partly in the shade of my friend the pine tree, and by my friend the rock.  I looked around and the trees started to dance and the grass seemed to flow like a gently, peacefully, rolling stream.  All the people relaxing around me were very beautiful.  It was one of the happiest moments I've ever had.  Everyone and everything were happy to be there sharing in each others' company.", "Someone suggested that we go exploring and I was happy with doing anything.  We walked around all the campers and busses and did some people watching.  It was a very surreal experience.  Walking around thinking crazy stuff, all the dealers wispering 'acid, shrooms, extacy' at us.  Then it happened:  I was lost.  Four hundred miles from home, tripping balls, and I was lost.  I tried to stay calm and was fairly successful.  I just remembered I was on drugs and they would go away sooner or later.  Finally I found my friends without incident and we went back and chilled on the grass which was very relieving.  We didn't find tickets to the show but I was content for I had had my own little 'show.'", "I think I will definitely do acid again some time.  It is quite an experience, but do some research before you try it.", "my friend G and i each took a hit of acid at my girlfriend's house and then after about 3 hours we left and drove 50 minutes back to my house...nothing.  we felt nothing.  5 hours later.  nothing.  duds, we were mad.", "so G left and went home and at about midnight, my world exploded like an atom bomb.  i have tripped once before this, and i didn't understand what was happening, but i knew it was so good, it was SOOO good...  ", "i just grooved with it.  my head opened up and i thought every thought and dreamed every dream that anyone had ever (and will ever) think or dream.  my entire being overflowed with life and thought and dreams and hope and...", "i laid down on my floor and put on my studio headphones (AMAZING sound quality) and turned on some Hallucinogen (for anyone reading this, Hallucinogen is a british psytrance artist.  his album 'twisted' changed my world, and i recommend you buy it N OW).  so i just succumbed to these booming trance beats and guttural grinding noises and i let myself float to the outer reaches of my own mind.  i traveled untrodden trails of my own brain and discovered avenues of life in my head that i never knew were there.", "then i took these gloves i have for raving that have glowing LED lights for fingertips and i went into my bathroom with a discman playing 'trance stimuli' and i just left my body.  i went through the entire album dancing in my bathroom thinking these explosive thoughts and discovering new life in an album i heard so many times.  and my gloves...my gloves blew my mind.  when the last track finished i was dripping with sweat down my entire body, but i wasn't tired.", "i laid on my front lawn and smoked cigarettes and just re-examined my ENTIRE being.  i thought about every aspect of my existence inside and out and i came to a conclusion after 2 hours of constant thought.", "i eventually slept and called G immediately when i woke up to tell him what i had experienced.  'say no more my friend,' he replied, 'i was right there with you.'", "and he was.... we never told each other about our trips because i knew and he knew there was no need.  we had a telepathic connection i never thought possible...he KNEW, and i KNEW.", "This story is being composed in hopes to help anybody who might find themselves in similar situations while experimenting with hallucinogens.  The story begins...", "I was 17 at the time, and I had just finished high school.  I was in high spirits with it being summertime and all.  I have an Uncle from California (I live in NJ) who usually visits every summer.  He has always been great with me, so I try to spend as much time as I can with him for the short time that he's here.  Well, this was a time I would NEVER forget!!!  =)", "While my Uncle visits us in NJ, he stays over my Grandmother's (his Mother's) house.  So I decided to stay the night over her house to hang out with him, talk, listen to music, play guitar, or whatever, because he is really great to be around.  It must've been around 8:30pm as it was just getting dark.  We decided to go for a walk to the store to get a drink on that warm summer evening.  As we were walking back to my Grandmother's house, he suggested that we should 'trip' tonight.  I was a little surprised, as I wasn't aware that he had any LSD with him.  I told him that I had never done it before, and he seemed shocked.  He said 'Oh man, George!!!  We've gotta trip tonight!'  He seemed really big on the idea of it being my first time, and him being the experienced mentor.", "We walked back into the house, and upstairs to where the spare room was that he and I would be staying.  It was around 9:30pm now, and my Grandmother was in her room across the hall getting settled to go to sleep.  We closed the door to the spare bedroom, and discussed how much I should take.  He was fumbling around in his suitcase, and I told him that I thought I should only take one hit, since i'd never done it before.  He waved his hand at me as if to blow me off, and said 'Ahhhh, you'll be fine with 2!'  Now, you must understand that through his eyes, 2 hits of today's LSD IS nothing, because he comes from a time, the 60's of course, where people were taking 10 hits of much stronger acid, usually in the 400-600 ug (micrograms) range.  However, I reluctantly decided to place all of my trust in him, as he'd never done me harm before.  I took the 2 small tabs out of his hand, and put them in my mouth.", "He suggested that we go downstairs to watch some TV, as there would be a little time before anything would happen.  I followed the leader.  I was laying on one couch, and he was on the other.  We were flipping through channels, not really saying a word to eachother.  I was finding myself absorbed in the TV, but otherwise fine, not really feeling any different.  My Grandmother has a sillhoulette in the living room, which was right behind the couch I was lying on.  It had been about 1/2 hour since we initally dropped the tabs, and I was looking through the sillhoulette now, and noticing small colorless kalidescope like patterns all over it.  I blew it off as it just being the way the light looked behind it, through the silky material.  But I noticed that I couldn't help but to keep staring at it, and my body felt energized, electrically charged.  I suggested to my Uncle that we go back upstairs to the room, that I was starting to feel weird.  He must've not been feeling it yet, because he said to me 'Are you sure?  Already?'  I told him yes, and thankfully he agreed, and we walked up the stairs, and opened the door to the bedroom where we would spend the rest of the night.", "It seemed as though the moment we opened the door and walked into the room, it was like stepping through the door to another dimension, much like Alice going into Wonderland.  At this point, I realized that the trip must be in full bloom.  'I must be peaking now..' I thought to myself.  The lights were on in the room, and I decided to sit on the bed and play around with my acoustic guitar that I had brought over.  I passed that idea quickly when I realized that I could hardly play a note; the guitar somehow seemed foreign to me now, and felt very awkward in my hands.  I put it down, and sat back, talking with my Uncle. ", "For some reason, my Grandmother came banging on the door.  She seemed to be mad about something, but it was hard for me to hear her with all the whirring and swooshing noises going on around me, or was it in my head?  =)  She walked in, and I broke out in hysterics!  I was laughing so hard on the bed at the mere sight of her!  She looked tired, with one eye open (obviously we had woken her up) and her hair seemed to not be attached to her head!!  It looked as though each single strand was an energy bolt of sorts, and was extending out, alive from her head!  The thought and sight of that caused me to double over in laughter.  Now understand, that this was strange for me.  This was the first time where I wasn't able to control myself.  I'd always prided myself on being a person able to deal with any situation that may arise while I was on drugs.  I had smoked pot many, many times before, and never was unable to control myself if I had to, whether it was near parents, cops, whatever.  Now, here I was laughing perhaps harder then I ever had, right in my Grandmother's face!!!  She was yelling something about us having the windows open in the room while she had the central air going.  My Uncle, obviously experienced in having to deal with situations while tripping, quickly patronized her, shut the windows, and rushed her back to bed.  We closed the door behind her, and decided to be a little quieter.", "We turned out the lights in the room, and went only by the street lights shining in from outside.  This was sufficient lighting to see each other and find things in the room.  I was really spinning now, I had a million thoughts going through my head at once, almost as a slideshow, but in a split second.  My Uncle decided we should listen to some music, and we chose the Beatles' White Album.  (For anybody that wants good music to trip to, listen to this!)  I laid myself back on the bed, and my Uncle sat near in a chair in a corner adjacent to the bed.  The music was strange and alive, and although I had heard this album numerous times, I heard things in it that I never had before.  My Uncle and I weren't talking at all now, just enjoying the music.  Well, at least he was.  I was far too caught up with what was going on in my head and in front of my eyes.  What was strange was how any sound I heard produced a corresponding hallucination.  I kept feeling as though I was slipping in and out of consciousness, but during the times of 'unconsciousness', I was fully aware of my being unconscious!  My eyes seemed to be closed, and I saw millions of patterns of cobweb and honeycomb like visuals, which would spin towards my field of vision, rotate, fade out, and then the next one would begin.  All the time, they would be changing color as well.  I remember green being a very dominant color in the entire experience though.", "I seemed to have 3 separate points of consciousness;  My main awareness, which knew that I was on acid, was at my Grandmother's in a room with my Uncle, and knew that I was lying on the bed tripping out of my mind.  Then the 2nd one, which was dealing with all of these images coming at me, and a 3rd which was completely emotional.  That part is the most memorable;  I remember going through every state of emotions in turn, in sequential order.  Each seemed to last only a few seconds.  I felt happy, then sad, then frightened, then angry, then depressed, and then it would begin all over again.  It was almost like a wheel turning, and at any given point on this wheel lay a state of emotion, which I would experience with each turn of the wheel. All 3 of these seemingly separate consciousnesses co-existed, harmoniously and accordingly.  No one interfered with the other; yet I was fully aware of all 3 at the exact same time, with my full attention devoted to ALL 3 together. At the points where I would seem to wake, or slip back into consciousness, I would look around the room, and the plants would seem to ooze, or melt.  I would close my eyes for a second, open them to look at the plants which would appear normal, and a couple of seconds later the oozing process would begin all over again.  This amazed and intrigued me!  Then something really strange happened;  I can only decribe it best as an out of body experience, for lack of better words.  I noticed that I was no longer on the bed, but rather in a far corner, suspended in mid air, watching the entire scene as if an observer.  I saw myself lying on the bed, with a cloudy greenish hue surrounding me.  I saw the entire room from where I was, and I saw my Uncle talking to me on the bed.  I saw myself answering him 'Yes', 'Yes', to whatever he said, although I knew that 'I' lying on the bed had no idea what he was even saying.  I could no longer comprehend language, only thought had any substance now.  At some point I found myself back in my body, but in a state of unconsciouness again.  Now I saw my life literally flash before my eyes, in all of 2 seconds, like a tape rewinding, but at a tremendous speed.  I acutally saw an embryo inside a womb, which I knew was myself.  I thought I had died.  This thought, though, was not at all unpleasant.  I felt content with whatever was happening, because I knew that I was useless in trying to fight it.  The time after this is blank, all I remember is my Uncle talking a whole lot to me, and me not understanding a word he was saying.  I remember that I just kept saying 'yea' and 'yes' to everything he said.  He didn't argue, although I was probably not making much sense.  He probably knew that I was far out, and decided to let me enjoy it and find my way, map my own realms.", "In an instant, I felt almost 'normal' again; something, which I can only describe as a great intensity, was no longer there.  It had been there a second ago, and like a flash of light, it was gone.  I could hear normal again, see normal, speak, and comprehend.  I didn't feel completely 'myself' though, and I knew the trip wasn't over, perhaps only the peak.  I felt detached, but this didn't bother me.  I felt enchanted, or mystified.  I felt as though I had figured out the keys to the universe, the answers to the unanswerable, and that I was almost God-like.  I knew I still wouldn't be able to fall asleep, as so many things were running through my head.  Not as they were before, but rather I was thinking about the things I had thought up before.  Everything now, though, didn't seem quite as baffling and perplexing as it had an hour before.  Either way, I felt as though I had been through a war, and came out victorious.  I had 'myself' back again!  I felt reborn, like a new person.  I felt as though my spirit had been cleansed, refreshed.  My Uncle suggested that we go outside on the porch and smoke cigarettes.  That sounded like the best idea i'd ever heard! About half an hour later, we retreated back into the room and I laid myself down to rest.  I knew I still couldn't sleep yet, but I started feeling worn, physically, and mentally fatigued.  My Uncle had CD's playing very softly now, and I lay on the bed as the morning sun rose.  I was awake to hear the very first sounds of the day.  Birds began to chirp, people were waking up and starting their cars to head out to work.  Everything seemed a little more crisp, with more life then ever before.  This was a nice thought to me.  I slowly drifted off into a peaceful sleep.  I remember my dreams that morning being more vivid than ever before in my life, and probably even up until now.", "I've tripped on LSD dozens of times after that, and on many more doses then the 2 I took that night.  But never did I have a trip again like I did with my Uncle.  Perhaps it was because I had complete trust in him, and because of that there was no paranoia.  Or perhaps I never had a trip like that again because I became so interested in LSD, I did months and months of research on it, and came to know almost everything there is to know about it.  Maybe because I knew exactly what to expect now, learned all about 'set' and 'setting', purchased the 'Psychedelic Experience' book, that I ruined tripping for myself?  Not to say I never had fun again on it, but it never had that magic it did that night.....", "I will remember the day for the rest of my life. I was about 15 yrs old, and had never touched any drug or alcohol yet. Never had I been high or drunk. I started hanging out with a new friend, him and some others had been experimenting with lsd for a few weeks. Needless to say the friend who i just met and was to have my first drug experiance with, a week before was in the hospital on an overdose from the lsd i was too take. ( shows my lack of maturity and descison making at the time)", "     Well the story starts as i decide to sleep over this kids house. The plan was to get some pot the next morning and for me to get stoned for my first time.Well it turns out that we could not get pot so i was encouraged to try acid the next day. I figured what the hell? If these guys liked it i could handle it! My friend explained the feeling of acid as cool and u c things like snow flake patterns. So that morning we headed for the extrmemly packed mall. I quickly took the small blue double dosed tab on my tounge.", "       within 20 minutes i was sitting on a bench staring at the floor with hysterical laughter. I no longer new my name or even cared. My friend looked at me and smiled, it only gets better he said. I then entered a candy shop and put a red hard candy in my mouth. within 5 minutes about 40 minutes into the trip all fuckin hell broke loose. the candy was flying out of my mouth, i could not control the feelings coming over my body, a red stream from the candy was shooting 5 feet out of my mouth! i quickly spit the candy on the floor.", "     i was no longer in control... i was walking but in a constant dream, i still to this day do not know how i knew where to walk. i could not see anything. i was walking outside of my own body, my soul was half in and half out of my body.. i could see my own self walking with no mirror... everything was scrambled television.. my body waist was twisting like a corkscrew in a cartoon! I only had random glimpses of reality and fell into a time trap. minutes like days seconds felt as hours. the crowded mall drowned horrifying sounds. i begged to leave the mall but could not function. paranoia and nausea set in. i found myself vomiting in the crowded malls floor. bright green chunks flew in all directions.peoples faces were melting off. Yet i had no cared no worries.", "      i was in a diffrent world. still to this day (5 years later) i have problems stepping into that mall. not until i was 18 did i dare to even touch a beer let alone any other drug. flashbacks occur often of walking down the street and i will walk out of my own body. i cant describe how powerful this drug is, only some people will experiance an effect like i had but i wish to warn anyone to know what u r getting into. lsd might be fun on a lower dose for me but i will not dare to touch it. lsd definitely scared me for life. my words cant explain the true nature of this disturbing trip.", "It all started on a Friday afternoon after school got out. I had sold drugs for a while but never really tried any of them except for bud. So I thought I would try LSD because the guy that I get them from says that they are really good. So I am talking to my friend, JM. I asked him if he wanted to trip with me. He wasn't sure at first but about 10 minutes later he came around to it. So I decided I would spend the night at his house since his is more secluded. ", "I am at JM's house at about 10.30; we are pretty much just waiting for JM's parents to go to bed. When they did, we took two doses each. We kept the two doses in our mouths and just sucked on them until they were gone. Nothing really happened until about 35 minutes later. I got somewhat dizzy and JM said he was seeing tracers when he would wave his hand back and forth. We were thinking 'damn this is pretty bad!' ", "Later we decided to go for a walk, because it was one of those nights when it was fairly foggy outside and you couldn't see that well. Before we left though, JM looked out the window and he yelled 'shit there are wolves out there!'  So he decided to take these scissors to protect us. So he grabs the scissors and we take off outside. We are just walking down the street outside and I am a little behind JM because I am kinda scared. I was fairly white too. Once we got down the street I was thinking this wasn't the best idea- I was hearing shit and seeing things so I thought we should go back home. So I tap JM on the side and he flys around and almost stabs me with the scissors. Luckly I was to the side of him or I would have been stabbed in the stomach. He did it because he thought I was a wolf. ", "So we made it back to JM's house and we are pretty much just sitting there talking to each other and listening to paul okenfield. By then I was at the peak of my trip. As I am sitting there it seems like I have left my body and am watching my self talk to JM. I guess I couldn't control the volume of my voice because it seemed as I was watching this 'movie,' I seemed to be getting louder and louder! By this time I was somewhat coming down from my trip. Before we took the doses we had pizza for dinner. So after we went and got the leftover slices. Everyone says LSD enhances your senses but as I was eating the pizza I couldn't taste anything on it. I could only feel it being chewed up in my mouth. ", "By this time I was tired, so I laid on the bed. I tried to close my eyes, but they would just open back up. It was like I would control them. Finally about 5.30 in the morning I finally was asleep out of total fatigue. Altogether I would not recommend it. It is dangerous because it seems not real and you feel like you can not be hurt.", "This was my first trip.  I was with my good friend M, who has been sober his whole life and still is to this day. He's the 'bookish' type. He was a good choice to go with since he was gonna be clean, and is a close friend who I constantly rely on and above all, TRUST.", "A little about me: I am currently in a bit of a situation with my family. They push me hard at school and have recently discovered that I smoke weed. I am subject to urine tests now. I am still trying to figure out who I really am as a person. It's hard. i'm not very popular, or very talented, or very motivated. I am probably not the best candidate for LSD. But my mindset that day was one of happiness and comfort. We were at the Furthur festival, headlined by Ziggy Marley and  The Other Ones (remainders of the Dead). I bought the hits in the lot. They were on a little tip portion of one of those garbage bag twist-ties. I promptly put it in my mouth and went in. For about half an hour, nothing happened. It was absolutely freezing and I was underdressed for the weather, and the onset blended in with my shivering. Marley was on and I really enjoyed his set, which ended with the sun perched beautifully in the western sky. I was definitely feeling effects.  Things began to take on a bit of a 'sheen', and I became increasingly talkative with M, who was talking about some boring thing, but i was feeling very entertained. As the sun set, The Other Ones came on and I got up to dance. Now I noticed that every time I tried to keep my legs in any position but locked-straight, They shook with a spasm. I think it was partially the cold. ", "As night took hold, the blankets on the ground spun and patterned in the grass. We went to the bathroom and that's when I really felt it. My walking was messed up, it looked like I was marching. I got under control and watched in amusement as the tiled walls of the bathroom twisted and rolled around me. When we went back up, I smoked maybe 3 hits with the people behind me and things exploded. Colorful fractal patterns danced and spun and seemed to actually coat all surfaces. I saw many repeating wallpaperish patterns, like a wheel with ducks inside, rotating slowly, to name one. As I looked at the stage, it became a fractalesque shape and then took the form of a purple sound wave that coalesced to the music. Then things got eerie. I heard my dad's voice yelling at me. I looked over at M and out of the corner of my eye, he looked like a strung up fish (in body position and facial expression, not actually with fins & stuff) with his eyes rolled back. The band had started its Drums/Space segment, which was totally freaking me out with weird sounds. The visuals had become pure and opaque. I started to feel like people where watching me. I tried to shake off the feeling by dancing, but every time I started to dance, i would get that paranoia. I would look behind me and all around. i decided to just sit and enjoy the music. It was hard. I kept thinking about myself and the start of school, and how I had to become a harder worker and a better person and get in a band and get .... whew! My mind was going too fast. My personality was being picked apart and examined thoroughly. I am a very analytical person, and now I was delving into my own head. I realized my insecurities and weaknesses. There are so many!! ", "Luckily, the band changed songs and this snapped me out of that particular bad spell. Wow, this stuff was SO reactive to my environment. I saw M sitting there, just like me, same position, and this really comforted me. I thought, 'why would anybody be staring at me at a festival like this, c'mon!'  This worked. I sat and soaked up the music. They ended with Sugar Magnolia and I was oh so happy, if not a little shook up. I also noticed that my jaw had been clenched all night. ouch. The paranoia, although very very slight, came back upon exiting the venue, but I was pretty much fine.", "My dad was driving us home. M said 'There's the car, let's go.' and I about pissed myself. I greeted my father, put on a tape, sat down, and prayed. He didn't talk much and when he did, I pretended to doze. The street lights and cars flew at me and the road twisted into bizarre forms. It felt like we were going 200 miles an hour. The tape I put in started to get very onimus sounding. I recognized it as a song, but it sounded like thunder and crashing. I took it out, felt better, and faked sleep all the way home. M left moments later, and it was just me, except...", "When I got upstairs, my mom handed me a bag for my garbage can. Why the hell was she up so late? I stupidly fumbled with the can and couldn't get it on. She gave me a look and walked off. I sat freaked over this little doozy for a minute, but then noticed the posters on the wall. i have lots of magazine sized pictures of bands & guitar players, so the wall is sort of like a mosaic. The people in the pictures seemed to melt within the borders of each poster, fill the bottom of it up like a glass of water, and slowly dribble down onto my carpet in multicolored trails of ink. cool. Everything in my room swelled and expanded (breathing). For some odd reason I grabbed a personal day timer/calculator thingy and got myself into a diary section I had written. The entries were titled 'March 5... march 7' and so on, but i had messed up the text so 'Ma' was deleted and a whole row of 'ch5, ch6...' was left. I interpreted it as channels, like on a broadband radio. I thought the entries were people trying to talk to me through my day planner! I spent a good ten minutes peering at these messages from people unknown until I figured it out and broke into gales of laughter. I decided to lie down with some headphones and I put on (why??) Rolling Stones, Exile on Main Street. I was aurally transported to the basement in which that recording occured. I could feel each instrument like an emotion. In the dark, spiraling rainbow shapes whizzed by and I could only smile smile smile.", "Lots of cool stuff happened that night. I saw a great concert, listened to great music afterward, and watched colorful hallucinations melt my room. The trip ended on a positive note, and I felt good the next day. But...", "Lots of bad stuff happened too. I had to deal with some intense paranoia, and ride home with my dad. I also got a true feeling of who I was. It was unnerving, and I now realize that I DO have to improve myself personality wise. This can be a devestating revelation to have on LSD. Luckily the band switched tunes here, a testamant to how easily I can be swayed by external factors. I think I need to wait until I have a better grip on my world before doing this again. I am not 'unstable', but I am still not fully realized as an individual. Beautiful as they can be, mind altering chemicals should be kept to a minimum for me until I straighten myself out a bit. Also, tripping around parents is BAD. I cannot tell you the fear I felt in that car. I'm very lucky my old man wasn't tired and didn't ask me to drive. So I don't know. was this a good trip, or a bad trip. The answer: It was a trip. nuff said.", "First, let me explain the large dose. I'm some sort of freak, because I had tried LSD five times before this time, going up to a dosage of two good hits without getting any effects other than physical ones. So, I figured I'd try four to see if that would do anything at all. I wasn't expecting much, but I got it.", "I am writing this 8 days after the trip, which was a monday nite on a large cruise ship in the Caribbean Sea. I went to dinner with my family, then went back to the cabin with my younger sister. I had decided I would go ahead and try it that nite. So at 8.30pm, I took the acid into the little bathroom with me into the little bathroom and consumed. My sister and I then left to go met our parents at the theatre on the ship to see a show. The show was a musical impersonater that would have been pretty entertaining even if one was completely straight. My family and I sat in a balcony seat overlooking the lower audience and with a decent view of the stage. I could feel it starting to work physically already by this time, around 8.45 or 8.50, while we were waiting for the show to start. I was actually starting to feel a bit nauseated, with the rocking of the ship and a very full stomach. I reminded myself that I could always leave the show if I got to feeling too bad. The bar service man came by and I ordered a sprite, then headed to the restroom. On my way back from the restroom, The Smilies kicked in. I couldn't help it. I was aware I had a silly grin on my face, but luckily it was gone by the time I got back to my seat where my family was.", "The sprite tasted like blood, but I drank it anyway thinking I needed the liquid in my system. The show was good, the impersonator did a very good job on the singers, so I thought. The show lasted for ever, however, thanks to the time dilation. My sister would look at me during the show and when I looked at her, her form kept jumping slightly side to side quickly. The crowd below.... the crowd looked like someone had taken a picture of it and pasted it onto a sheet that kept undulating. ", "We didn't stay for the entire show. My sister began to feel sick and we left I think around 9.45. I wasn't aware of what was happening, I didn't know the show was not over. When I realized what was going on however, I told my dad that I would split and see them later. He said allright, have fun. ", "Let me just say now that most of the events of that evening are fuzzy to various degrees. Anyway, after splitting from my family, I wandered the ship, getting deeper and deeper into the A. I made my way to a cafeteria on the second highest deck, one with windows for the walls. Luckily, it wasn't very occupied. Only a few other people sat at one other table there, speaking some other language. Hell, I remember it being Spanish, but it really could have been anything, or nothing. ", "I sat down at a table to figure out what the hell was going on. I looked down at my pants and intricate patterns were forming on them and quickly becoming other images. I remember seeing a dog barking at a woman and then these two entities merging and dissolving away. I looked at my arms. The skin was tightening and pulsating, the hairs were being forced out from their pores. I looked out the window. Dark streams of colour were flowing past the window. The other people had left and two crew members were sitting at a table, they looked philipino. I left after sitting there for a few more minutes.", "At this point, I think I went up to the highest deck to sit in the wind and think. I had stuck my discman in my pocket before the show figuring that I would need it later. I listened to the first five songs of Pink Floyd's Meddle. The music sounded better, but I can't remember why exactly. No doubt it had something to do with the fact that I had a milligram of lysergic acid diethylmide surging through my brain. I lied in a reclined chair, listening to the music and taking in my surroundings. When the wind would catch my pants and hold them against my legs in a certain way, it made it look like my legs were wasting away, developing deep holes in them. The stars were bright that night; there were no city lights to deal with or a moon. Every star seemed to have thousands of other stars flowing into them constantly, single stars consuming entire galaxies.", "In the blackness of the sky I saw something that will probably be the most difficult thing to describe in this passage. The image was like a complex geometric pattern of cubes. The cubes were not stacked flat, but were set up so that they had one corner pointing directly towards the earth. Every side of the cubes showed the same design, a design which changed constantly. The design had tessalations of Japanime in it, constantly changing the subject face. I split after seeing enough of the sky show and listening to Meddle.", "At this point, I think I wandered back down into the ship, inside, off the open decks. The next thing I have definite memory is entering the main atrium in the ship, where there are five floors around an open center. As I was walking into the room, a man, probably 30 or so, stared into my face. In recollection, I should have told the guy to fuck off or just ignored him. He held up a camera, wanting me to take a picture of him and his family. However, and this is important, he was Italian. He didn't speak any English nor did any members of his group. I took the camera and waited for the group to essemble to be photographed. However, they just kept standing around in the circle. It gets even more complicated. I had just been walking with my discman in my hand, and now that i needed two hands to take the picture. I had to put the discman in my pocket, but I couldn't find my pockets. So, the logical thing to do at the time was to hand the Italian guy the discman. This caused confusion, he refused to take it and I shook it at him and told him to just hold it for now, which was futile since he didn't speak english. This whole event didn't take much time at all. Also, the guy had small scars on his face and they would jump to whoever I focused on in the group so that they had the scars too. Some other member of their group showed up and took over the job of taking a picture, so I was relieved of that duty. I went up to an outside deck, feeling bad and stupid about what had just happened.", "I leaned over the rail and thought about how dumb that last incident had been. I wished I had a friend there to take care of me, but I was alone, head full of lsd, roaming a huge ship with three thousand other occupants on the middle of the ocean in goddamned nowhere. I watched the waves and continued to think. The waves caused by the ship were entertaining to watch. After a few moments, I stopped seeing waves. Instead, I saw milk. The entire ocean had turned to milk, covered with fruit loops. We were now traveling upon The Cereal Sea. The cereal then turned back into the dark water it had been before, but I was seeing the waves as dark stemed flowers with dark coloured petals. A sea of flowers. I continued to watch the waves, and they continued to evolve into new things. Each stage of evolution was a bit odder than the previous one. ", "I saw huge jellyfish, fuckin' big stinging jellyfish. The boat had come into a herd of them crossing the seas (so I thought.) I watched them swim and noticed something odd: their mode of communication was electricity. They shocked each other to convey messages. A new species no doubt. I remember thinking about jumping in with them, meeting an early and painful death. However, the waves didn't stay as jellyfish forever. Oh no, the jellyfish became dinosaur skeletons before long. Large carnivore ones, white bones. I had had enough reflection while watching the waves and walked to the end of the ship, the very back of the ship, so that I could watch the trail that the wake of the boat left. This was the best part of the trip, probably. I didn't see anything in the waves, but I started hearing things. Wonderful ambient techno was being created in my head, just for me. It was perhaps a bit repeatitive, but nevertheless beautiful. The music lasted for quite a while, as long as I looked at the wake. ", "By this time, I was growing tired of the paranoia and feeling like I should be hiding from people. If I had known about a small deck I found the next day I could have gone there and no one else would have been around. So, a little after midnite I think it was, I attempted to go back to my cabin. However, this wasn't as easy as it should have been. I entered into the atrium, knowing it was possible to get to my cabin from there, but not quite sure how. I felt like everyone was looking at me, and I probably looked confused or lost. People were beginning to look ugly. I thought about just asking someone for help, which would have been a bad idea. I eventually found the hallway that lead to my room and proceded down it. I felt like I should say 'I'm glad we had this little talk' to the universe. I had come up with the idea of Life being a challenge, and god being the thing that gives the challenge. I've dismissed the latter idea as foolishness since I'm atheistic. But anyway, In the hallway I passed a blonde girl that smiled. I remember thinking 'You are Americana, I want to exist within you.' Whatever the hell that means.", "I entered my cabin and went to take my contacts out. In the mirror, I looked near death. I was sweaty looking and just odd generally. I listened to Echoes from Meddle in bed and then went to sleep. However, the LSD kept me from being able to sleep well at all. I tossed and turned for hours. I should have gone back out since I was still under the influence... ", "The next day I felt fine and recounted the events of the previous nite. I felt quite good, actually, like the LSD had put some things into perspective. Was the trip worth doing? sure. Would I do it again? Hell yeah.", "This is a report on the first time I had a really unpleasant experience with psychedelics. Since that experience, I have had a few others that were 'bad' in one sense or another, but nothing quite like the gut wrenching terror of this experience. This occurred fairly early in my tripping career. I was 18 years old, just out of high school. It was approximately one year after my first trip. I had tripped approximately 15-20 times over the course of that year, and thought I knew what I was doing. I was very overconfident. ", "It started off normally enough. A friend called and said she could get me some acid. I went to see her and bought enough for myself and my companions. She told me it was very good stuff, and mentioned a couple of people had flipped out on it. I was unconcerned. ", "I returned home and took two hits. My friends likewise ingested theirs. One girl, a good friend of mine and one of my roommate's girlfriend (we'll call her S) was trying LSD for the first time. Immediately after ingestion, I left to give my brother a ride to the place he was staying. ", "After dropping him off I went to a convenience store nearby to get a beverage. As soon as I walked in I realized I was feeling the acid. This was maybe T+20 minutes. Already things were beginning to undulate and move. A sign for chili looked alive. I grabbed what I was there for and got the hell out of there. ", "The ride home was interesting. It started to rain and I was starting to trip harder. I was a little tense to be driving while tripping but I made it home safely. When I got inside, my roommates were watching the end of Brazil. I sat down and watched the rest of it with them, even though I hadn't seen much of the beginning or middle. ", "This was a mistake. If you have ever seen Brazil, you know exactly what I mean. The end of this movie is very dark, very surreal, and very disturbing. Anyone who knows anything about set and setting would realize that was not the best thing to be watching as a powerful acid trip came on... ", "After the movie we sat around and listened to music. I was really tripping, probably as hard as I had ever tripped before. The posters on the wall were breathing and crawling out over their normal boundaries. S was running around like most first timers, going off about everything. ", "About this time, two girls, A and B, showed up. They asked if anyone wanted to go hang out with them. B was an exgirlfriend of mine. One of my roommates, E, and I decided to go with them. This was my second mistake. ", "We drove around town looking for 'something to do' (a party). We ended up at another friend of mine's house. There were several people there drinking beer and one or two who were tripping as well. We went in and sat down to hang out. ", "There were many people around. I started to get confused as to what was going on around me. In fact, little or nothing was going on, but I was being overwhelmed by the presence of so many people. B left to go get someone or something and M (a friend of both of ours) decided to play a little joke on me. ", "He told me (at least I think he did, I was pretty tripped out!) that B had taken some LSD. This shocked me, since she had always been uninterested in it before. He also told me she wanted to rekindle things with me. Why he told me these things I do not know. Perhaps he thought it would be funny. I think he was tripping as well, so maybe he was just going off on some weird head noise of his own. In any case, it severely fractured my already tenuous grip on reality. ", "I was suddenly very worried about B. I thought she had just taken her first hit of LSD, and I knew she shouldn't be out driving if she had. I started to have all these visions of dying, car wrecks, etc. My mind flashed back to my experience earlier in the evening, driving as the acid started to work. In short, I had myself worked up pretty well by the time she returned. ", "When she came back, I quickly pulled her into another room to talk. I started asking her about her trip, if she really wanted to get back together, etc. She was looking at me like I was a total nut. She was fairly inexperienced with dealing with trippers. She tried to straighten me out, but I seemed unable to process anything she was saying. I was just getting more and more tense and confused. She was able to convince me that she wasn't interested in rekindling and that she hadn't taken any LSD. This took her the better part of an hour, and in that time I somehow convinced myself I was in mortal peril. I was convinced I was dying. ", "I was totally adrift. I had no idea what was real. I was peaking on a good dose of LSD, and everyone was just confusing the hell out of me. To be fair, I don't think anyone realized I was losing it until it was too late.One of the guys there who was drinking was screwing around with a screwdriver, pretending to stab himself with it. This seemed unbearably gruesome to me. All my thoughts centered on death. I felt like I was in the middle of a psychedelic hurricane with no way out. ", "I sat down in the corner and closed my eyes. It was the only thing I could think of to do. People continued to try and talk to me, but I ignored them. I heard someone come in, and decided to open my eyes. And what did I see? A giant snake crawling right towards me and my roommate leaving with my ride. ", "My roommate was deathly afraid of snakes, which is why he left. The neighbors had brought over a bull snake to show us. The guy who it belonged to had thought it would be funny to let it go so it would crawl over to me. I just thought that was the final straw. ", "At this point, my mind overloaded and shut down. I just don't know what occurred for the next few hours. I remember a very few things, and I am still not sure what is real and what I hallucinated. I know I kicked everyone out and locked the door. Keep in mind, this wasn't my house I was kicking everyone out of. I did insist that one of my friends, P, stay with me. I wouldn't talk to him, but I wouldn't let him leave either. At some point, he snuck out (I don't blame him. I was probably scaring the hell out of him). ", "I spent the next few hours in hell. I was certain I was dying, or had already died. I kept thinking about heaven and hell, and lots of Christian religious themes. I was raised Christian, but had rejected it long ago. Not as fully as I had presumed, apparently. I was certain that since I was not 'good' as the churches of the Christian world defined it, I must be 'evil'. I went through hours of agony and terror. At some point, I apparently pissed my pants in fear. ", "People came by looking for the guy that lived there. I refused to talk to them, or even acknowledge their existence. I thought they were illusions. ", "After a while, I started to reform my ego. The reality map I came back with was extremely bent, however. I was convinced I was in some kind of Limbo, waiting to die fully. I thought when I ran out of cigarettes, I would simply cease to be. At this point, the idea didn't frighten me any longer. Death would have been a relief. The thought crossed my mind that maybe I was supposed to do some symbolic suicide to move on, and I looked for a gun or knife to do it with. Luckily, there was nothing like that present. ", "One of the guys (the one who had been mock stabbing himself) came down to check on me. I let him in, but wouldn't talk to him much. I was convinced he was some sort of demon who looked like my friend. He talked me into coming next door where everyone was waiting. ", "The scene over there was normal, but it seemed very bizarre to me. I was convinced everyone there was a demon replica of themselves. Their actions seemed inexplicable. Now I realize that it was my mindset that was screwy, but then it seemed the world was replaced with a dark mirror version. ", "We sat around while I tried to make sense of what had just occurred. I was still extremely uneasy. I thought I was down, but I am certain now I wasn't. My friend M had flies buzzing around his head, and I swear I saw one fly into his open mouth and crawl out of his nose. This obviously didn't do much for my state of mind. ", "An hour or so later, my roommate came and picked me up. Actually, most everyone who was still there piled into his VW Bug and drove over to my house to watch a movie. 11 people in a VW, and I know that wasn't a hallucination. When I got home I went and sat in the shower for close to an hour with all my clothes on, trying to figure out what had happened and what was real. Afterwards I felt better, but not all together. I was tempted to quit using psychedelics altogether, but something told me I had to go back at least one more time. ", "At the time, this was the most frightening and unpleasant experience of my life. It is still the worst trip I have ever taken. I realize now that my set and setting were awful, and that I was asking for a bad trip. At that time, I used psychedelics very casually, for recreational purposes. I didn't take any of the insights I gleaned from them very seriously. I was young and had a lot of emotional problems, most of which weren't worked out until years later. In short, I was the perfect candidate for a bad trip. ", "My next few trips were pretty mellow. I did have a few more unpleasant experiences that year, which led to my stopping usage for close to a year and a half. This trip had some profound effects on my life. It caused me to take everything a bit more seriously. I think that if I had had the courage to really face some of the things that had come up, I would have gained more from it. Instead, I chose to run away and stop tripping for a while. ", "I chose to put this experience here as a warning to novice explorers that psychedelics aren't always fun and beautiful. Sometimes trips can be horrifying and ugly. However, those trips tend to show you where you really need to work, if you have the strength to face the issues they bring up. I hope that someone can learn from my bad experience, and possibly avoid one of their own.", "I am an old head. I have not taken large volumes of LSD, as it's potency seems to revolve around your potency. It is the only drug that is impossible to abuse. Respected, it can be dreadfully strong. It operates on your system primarily as a sensory amplifier, when potent, to the point of distortion. ", "As a professional musician, I can say that it's Inspirational,but to be respected. When used as a tool to gain advantage over booze and other situations, it is at best extra legs. Over-use leads to depression. The power to trip is in you: LSD is only the catalyst. While you are young, you can dig it the most, it uses up the vitamins and enzymes in your system, which are replaced by time and nutrition. Have respect. Do you see God?.....Of course!!!!!! By opening your eyes wide and gaining empathy with His creation! Do you become God???// No way.  ", "You must repent. It is not wrong to experience LSD, it is a privledge, and a joy. How can you get tied up in an experience that is only temporary.? By taking what you've learned to the test. That's Life. Love, Stephen", "Well I've written to this page before and I don't know if you guys have read any of my stuff, but if you have you know that I have had a few wild trips...  But here's the deal, LSD does have side effects, I have found no long term effects, but let me relate to you the short term side effects that I experienced.  ", "I am a very experienced LSD user, I have taken many different kinds from liquid, to geltabs, to paper, to pills.  I started a count when I first started using it and at about that time there was an LSD explosion in my area, in Massachusetts, it was everywhere, I was getting sheets for a dollar a hit.  Making a killing, but here's my point, I ate a lot of it too.", "Once when I ended up tripping 6 days in a one week, (which a slept every night that week) by the end of the week I was having trouble organizing things into the proper order in my brain, I was affected for about a month, in which I stopped all use for that month.  For instance, when I was in a place with a lot happening like an intersection in the road, I couldn't seem to grasp where I was and I was in a state of complete confusion, not knowing what to do at all.", "That is just an isolated incidence, but as I kept taking the drug more and more things kept happening, my night vision was shot to hell, I couldn't really distinguish things in the dark anymore, even at a close range of 5 feet or so.  Whereas before I had excellent night vision, my ability to navigate and sense of direction was completely disorientated.  I had trouble formulating sentences and keeping my thoughts together in my head.  (just to note, this also happened when I was sober, and I frequently took breaks from LSD usually for a period of 2 weeks to month) I also used to have a stuttering problem when I was much younger, that also came back, very badly, I couldn't get two words out of my mouth without stuttering.  (this happened around month 8)", "I felt less intelligent, but at the same time all this 'damage' was happening, I felt like my emotional self was being healed, like all the anger and sadness from my childhood was being released, I felt like I was figuring out the meaning to life, and the purpose of it all.  And so much more I can't explain but is now a part of me, and anyone who's taken LSD knows what I'm talking about here.  So in conclusion, LSD does cause some kind of 'damage' (I use damage for lack of a better word, by the way, hopefully you understand what I'm trying to get at)", "As far as I am concerened all the problems I have refered to have repaired themselves, but it took a while.  I probably won't ever use LSD ever again, because even though it brings you to a holy place there are side effects, and there must be a way to get there naturally, maybe mescalin :).  But it has been a year and a month since I have taken LSD and like I said all these problems have vanished.  But it took about 6-8 months for them to completely vanish.  So I am saying this, to all you academics out there, there hasn't been a study that proves LSD causes damage, but there also haven't been studies that prove LSD doesn't cause damage, so there you go take it for what it's worth.  With any drug, it's good to be careful and use it only in moderation, I did not and had side effects.  So just remember, I know what I know and you know what you know, you may not agree with me, but hey that's life.  Try what I did and see if it happens, I bet you won't...  Because even though you may say it doesn't cause damage, I bet you really do believe somewhere in that 12% of your brain you use.

I smoked Salvia Divinorum about 5 times before, and only had noticible effects once.", "I have spent the last 2 years doing extensive research of drugs, because I never like to just do something, I like to understand it and have an idea of what to expect.  I have hundreds of hours clocked in the research of drugs, and 150 hours of that time was solely dedicated to LSD.  My research consisted of Erowid's resources as well as other web sites, many books, countless trip-reports on both Erowid and the Lycaeum,  I have interviewed about 15 people that have done acid and gotten all pieces of the spectrum.  Such things as, 'The worst experience of my life' 'The most enlightening experience of my life' 'I laughed at the walls alot'  to what I feel is the most accurate description of the effects of LSD, I am a lucid dreamer, I dream very rarely but when I do the dreams are lucid, I know I am dreaming, and I can control my dreams. and this description was very intrigueing 'You're a lucid dreamer, well, I would say acid is like lucid living.'", "None of this, my research, my interviews, my trip report reading, prepared me for what happened a few weeks ago.", "After months of searching, and failed connections and deals falling through, I finally was able to aquire some LSD from a friend with connections in a larger city.  I bought 10 LSD Green Gel-Tabs and sold 4 to a friend, as he had been searching as well.", "My and my best friend decided to do it wed,  I barely slept that night anticipating and giddy from finally going through with this experience, I had a very positive outlook on things.", "Wed morning I woke up at 9 am, and I had a leisurely breakfast and some coffee, showered and dressed, and drove over to Dave's house. I arrived at Dave's house at about 9:45 and we unhooked his phone and locked his doors, so we would not be interrupted or bothered.", "We each took one gel-tab at exactly 10 am, and started watching Titan A.E. to kill time.  After about 45 minutes it started to hit dave, and he was engrossed in the movie. well, after one hour, it hadn't hit me,  Dave had swallowed his, and I had let mine dissolve on my tongue.  after 1 1/2 hours, I was having no effects, so I decided to take another gel-tab, complaining that maybe I needed more because I was so heavy.  Dave took another one as well, I swallowed this one this time, thinking maybe that was the problem.", "The movie finished, and we were watching TV, at the 2 hour mark I started complaining that 'maybe I'm just the only mother f*&^er on earth that this doesn't work on'  ( a complaint I remember making the first time I did DXM ) so I took one more tab, and dave took one more as well, the last of our LSD.  thats a total of 3 green gel-tabs a piece.  I was bored, and a cartoon came on featuring a puppy wearing boots, he was running and stomping in puddles and such in a rain storm, and then a rainbow appeared, and he went to look at this puddle that the rainbow ended at.  A small frog jumped out of the puddle and just looked at the puppy.  The puppy said 'You can't live in a puddle, it's not deep enough.'  And he reached to pick up the frog, and it dissapeared.  Suddenly it appeared on the puppy's head, and the puppy looked up, the frog said to the puppy, 'You'll never catch me, I'm the frog that lives in the puddle at the end of the rainbow.'  This was not funny, or amuzing, but at that very moment, I burst out in a fit of laughter the likes of which I have never known, and kept laughing like a fool for the next 5 minutes, and when I came down, I was definitely 'Tripping'", "Dave, Pleased that things had finally started to happen for me, turned off the TV, and we put in Mr. Bungle. if you have never heard Mr. Bungle, I highly recommend them. So we started exploring his house, dave decided it'd be fun to clean.  While he cleaned the kitchen floor, I watched the shadows from his table and chairs morph and shift into faces and words, words like, 'Chaos' 'Joy' 'Fear' 'Love'  and then into more faces.  and at the back of my mind I had a thought, probably produced from watching fear and loathing too many times.  'We were somewhere around Ogdensburg, on the canadian border, when the drugs began to take hold.'    ", "Let me just tell you that, dave's whole house is very 70's and retro, from the furniture to the wallpaper, his mother hasn't redecorated since dave was born....  The wallpapers were doing all sorts of fun stuff.  Flowing like water and rippling, and then the ever present breathing...  We went to his basement, which was even more 70's than the rest of the house, and just sat around touching everything and looking at everything, and I played with his synthesizer and was totally digging it.", "About that time, 3:30pm or so, Dave's mother came home from her job.  So dave and I made small talk with her and then left, we went to mcdonalds and got some food, cuz we were hella hungry,  The Hi-C orange drinks we got, exploded with flavor in our mouths, and the food was full of amazing texture as we ate.  We parked my van near some factories and watched smokestacks putting off smoke and the smoke danced in patterns and shapes and faces.  Again the smoke formed the words, 'Chaos, Fear, Love, And Joy'", "Overall, I would consider the experience very very positive, with the only downside to the whole thing is that when I came down, I had a headache for 7 hours till I finally fell asleep,  I slept till noon the next day, and then bout 20 more hours when I got home.  And two weeks later, I still have incredibly vivid dreams, even better than before.  ", "Dream Well everyone. There is still alot of beauty in the world.", "My second time taking LSD was my most visual experience, but it was also the scariest trip I've ever had.  Me and a couple of friends wanted to get really drunk before we were supposed to be in a play the next day (which I starred in).  We had a hard time finding some alcohol, but we did come across a large amount of LSD in the form of tabs.  It was about 9:00, so I said what the hell.  It would probably wear off by the time I had to be in the play.  That was a very wrong statement.  This trip lasted even through the play.", "I took one to start with, and my other friends took more than one each.  An hour passed, and nothing was occuring.  We were outside in front of a bonfire, and it started to get pretty dark out.  I started getting worried, and decided to take 2 more tabs.  In about a half an hour I started to feel the effects coming on.  A tree branch seemed 3D as it stretched toward me.  One friend put in some Marilyn Manson, and it freaked me out. I stood up feeling very dizzy and plopped down on the grass to stare at the stars.  They were spinning around in amazing patterns, and sucking me up into a spiral.  This forced me to go back to the fire.", "I started getting very scared; I don't know why, but I was.  I looked over at my friend who was staring at my face awkwardly.  His face started to decay and his skin was falling off.  I turned my head in disgust, and told him what I saw.  I looked back, and his face morphed into a werewolf, then a zombie, and a skeleton.  I told him to stop what he was doing.  He told me to be calm, and think happy thoughts.", "The whole world was spinning around me at this point.  A large tree, looming over me, bent down and pointed at me.  I got up, ran into the grove area, next to the bonfire, and saw a sea full of waving skeletons.  I started screaming like a maniac, and the other guys told me to shut up and sit down.  I calmly sat back down, and totally forgot what I just went through.  I stared back at the same friend again, and suddenly his face turned into Herman Munster from the Munsters.  I started giggling, which caused all of the fryers to laugh with me.  I knew I was still frying hard because the fire was melting into my feet, so I stood up and said that I had to try and get some sleep.", "I went into the tent, and stared up at the inside of the tent.  I saw amazing swirls of color and different colored naked women dancing all around my eyes.  They kept calling my name, but I couldn't reach them.  I closed my eyes, and saw quilt patterns of women's breasts, followed by a hopping bunny, which zoomed off into a trail of psychedelic colors.", "I knew I couldn't sleep, so I got up and sat back with the guys at the fire.  I feel that at this point (about 1:00) my peak had come and gone, but I was still frying hardcore.  From the period of 1:00-4:00, I was in a deep state of confusion, not knowing who people were, who I was, what I was doing there, and why I took the acid.", "When the morning started to make its face known, we all got up and took a walk down the street, looking at the beautiful colors coming from the flowers all around us.  I was still feeling the effects of the drug, so I started to get worried again.  When the other guys got back to the house, I ran over to my house, which is down the street, and ran into my shower.  The walls on all sides of me seemed to be melting down to my feet.  I saw faces popping up on the walls and when I waved my hand in front of me, I saw a million hands tracing off of it.  I felt a deep sense of fright while taking this shower, which caused me to cry and punch myself.", "When I got out of the shower, I quickly ran back to the house where my friends were, and realized that the shower didn't help, because I forgot where I just came from.  The time was now about 7:00, and I had to be at the play at 8:00.  I felt scared beyond control.  Everyone told me that I would be all right, if I just calm down, and not worry about it.", "We all piled into my car, and I drove down to the school.  We got out, and I felt like I had been beat up.  I couldn't look at anyone in the face, and I couldn't do the play because I forgot almost all of my lines.  My friends that were with me the night before helped me out with my lines and, lo and behold, the first showing of the play started.  I did very badly, but luckily, I wasn't the only one.  I rested during the break between shows, and told myself that I would do great on the next show.  I tried to push the bad thoughts out of my head, and the show went on.  It went very good.  After the play, I felt like throwing up, so I went to sleep in my bed, and woke up the next morning, feeling great because nothing bad went on, even though I worried too much.", "About a week ago, I obtained some LSD in the form of sugar cubes, and decided that I would trip on my birthday, which was yesterday. I am fairly experienced with acid, having tripped at least 20 times in the past, and I have taken in excess of 5 hits on multiple occasions, and had never had a bad trip. ", "This night, I dosed 5 cubes at around 6pm, and I expected a fairly routine, intense, yet mellow trip. Around 6:30, I started to get intense body waves and slight visuals, and I knew that this was going to be a big one. I got on the computer and started talking to people until I decided that I couldn't pay attention with all the visuals I was getting, so I went upstairs to get myself in order. When I got up there, I was starting to get kind of panicky, because I felt like I was about to go somewhere I had never been before, so I rolled a joint (with much difficulty) with the hopes of mellowing me out a bit. This was a bad idea, because with each hit, I began to lose more and more control until I felt like I was hanging by a thread. I was getting the most intense visuals of my life, but that was nothing compared to the intense mind fuck that was raping my brain. I felt like I was existing in snapshots, where I would be alert for about 5 seconds, and then I would lose the next 5 seconds, only to return, having to make up for the time I had lost. Does that make sense? If you've experienced it, you would know... ", "I kept trying to think positive, but I could barely think at all so it was a lost cause. I knew I had to get out of my house, so I called my friend and told her I was the middle of a serious tweak, and that I needed help. She said that I sounded completely out of it and that I kept blanking out and slurring my words, and it took about a minute in a half for me to say a simple sentence. I barely remember even calling her. I went outside to wait for her, and as I was standing out in the cold, I could feel all these invisible hands touching and grabbing the back of my legs, and the ground looked like it was shaking and swaying like an earthquake. The only thing I could concentrate on were the cigarettes I kept smoking, which took as much focus as I could muster. I kept forgetting why I was outside, but all I knew was that I could not go back inside. I felt like I was going crazy and losing my mind, and the only thing that kept me sane was the small amount of rationality I had in my mind, which kept telling me that it was only the effects of the drug. It didn't matter though... I wanted out... ", "Finally, my friend arrived and helped me into her car. I kept thinking that it was a bad idea that I had called her, and she was going to try to hurt me. I just sunk into my seat and watched the my surroundings as we drove. The town I have lived in all my life looked so unfamiliar and scary, and I felt like everything was closing in on me. She said she was going to pick up her boyfriend and asked if I would be ok in the car alone for a few moments. I said 'ok', and when she got out of the car I looked at my watch. It said 9:20. While she was inside, I was seeing shadows in the street everywhere, and kept seeing police lights that weren't really there. I kept expecting a swat team to come and pull me out of her car, and I knew that If that happened, I would be able to say nothing to protest because I could barely even think, let alone argue with some nonexistent cops. ", "After several minutes of I got the distinct feeling that I was getting really old really fast, and I looked at my watch again, thinking that I had been in my friends car alone for at least an hour. My watch said 9:22. It had been only 2 minutes since she had left. This really freaked me out, and I put my hands over my ears hoping that the mind fuck would go away. As soon as I did this however, I heard a lound piercing scream-like sound in my left ear. This sound would switch to my right ear and back again, and did so until I took my hands off my ears. Finally, my friend returned with her boyfriend, and we left. Their return calmed me down alot, because it was comforting to listen to their normal conversation, because it reassured me that reality still existed. ", "We drove around for quite a while, until I finally was in the state of mind where I was back in control. She dropped me off at home at around midnight, and I went inside. I was still tripping hard and getting intense visuals, but I had a much higher level of control. I finally went to bed at around 5 am, and woke up at around 1pm today feeling pretty much back to normal, with the exception of some very minor lingering trails, and the memory of an unforgettable night... I guess the moral of the story is NEVER underestimate the power of acid.

Most of the information is taken from a paper I prepared 2 days after the experience. I think about this experience every day, and it's been almost 3 months.", "I went over to my friends house. He was having a party with about 60 people. We were smoking a lot of weed. Then someone brought acid over. I am an experienced user with acid, and it wasn't too big of a deal that I decided to take six, although the most I had ever had was five, which was a bad experience due to being on a camping trip. But I was with my friends, and there was always weed if I started to get tense. But what I've learned from this experience and many others, is that weed intensifies the trip significantly.", "First, everything started to get louder about 20 minutes after I had taken them. I was experiencing a mild tripping feeling, with slight visuals and feelings of the adrenaline flowing. We started smoking out of a gasmask. I had a lot, like about 10 bowls. I was in my friend's bedroom, where there were only about 5 people. I started to quickly loose reality 1 hour after I had taken them. That's when things got crazy. All in a sudden, SMASH! I fell through the bed I was laying on, fell through the floor, and down to the next level in the apartment, in which the room looked exactly the same. (I only imagined this had happened). I was laying there, my friends still there. I looked at my chest. Guts were hanging out. I could feel severe pain. I didn't say a word. Things are slightly foggy from there, but I do remember knowing I was dead. I was thinking, what did I do to deserve to die? I couldn't move. People who I knew from school who were not at the party were looking at me, knowing I was dead, and saying things like, he was a weirdo, I never did like him, he deserved it. I was in total terror. So this is what death is like. ", "The ambulance and police came (in my head). I saw the flashers. The cops came in and looked at my dead body. 'Yep thats what acid will do to you' they said smiling. I didn't understand why the music was still playing. I never looked at the imaginary cops directly. My friends were talking about me, about old times. They seemed unusually happy that I was dead. This thought angered me. I kept thinking, what's my coworker, my mom and everyone else going to think when they find out I died when I was tripping. I was wondering when I was going to be dead completely, like going black or going to heaven, hell, or wherever. I was seeing myself almost in the third person, in a pile of blood. I finally got the strength to get up. I thought everyone would be suprised that I was there. My friend was like, 'Are you ok?' I said what the fuck is going on!!!? He calmly said, 'It's a party dude'.  I repeatedly asked him what happened. He said I was just laying there that whole half hour I was on his bed. I looked at where I was lying. There was no blood. I was now experiencing the equivalent to a basic 3 hit trip. I got reality back sooner that I thought I would. The next day, no one will ever know how happy I was to be alive. To this day I am so thankful to be alive, even though I consider my life shitty. I wonder if some parts of the trip were due to Paxil, which I have been taking for months. The times I've tripped while taking Paxil seem to be more intense for a lesser period of time. My point of this story besides sharing my extremely odd and scary experience is, you can be with your best friends and still have a bad trip.", "I wouldnt classify this one as a bad trip, just a little too intense. Ive tripped many times in the past, and all have been truly beautiful experiences. But something was different about this one. Maybe it was the fact that 3 or 4 different versions of Satan morphed out of a single cloud in less than a second, Or the feeling of having my brain boiled from the heat of a wood stove (lots of audible bubbling and popping on that one) And who could forget my friend Jeff's foot getting stuck to the floor or the sight of a lake moving at a hyperspeed, previously unfathomable to any of us. Universes collided, personalities were distorted, any tie to reality was severed. For christ's sake, Jim, Our world was vanishing and we all knew it. In a nutshell, things got pretty sketchy.", "The night was perfect for a full bore sensory overload frenzy.

I hadnt felt that great in a long time, and it felt like my best trip yet. We basked in the pail moonlight untill Midnight, then simultaneously extracted our second cubes from their little tinfoil homes and feasted on them like a pack of sugar crazed 3rd graders, hoarding free candy. We then promptly went inside and sucked down a jibber the size of a railroad spike, and blasted off into the ionisphere of our own individual conciousnesses.", "I made my way to a couch, collapsed, and began my journey into the depths of my own existance.  For approximatly 2 hours, My spirit(Minus my body) seemed to be floating through an endless sea of white foam. I thought about a lot of things in those 2 hours. A LOT OF THINGS!! Eventually, the depth of my thought began to transcend words, and all was subjective. I couldn't see, hear, or feel a damned thing, words didnt exist anymore. I began using raw emotions, and the abandonment of words to navigate through the foam which led me to a level of clarity I've never experienced. I was still up to my subjective ass in foam mind you, but that didnt matter. Everything was different now. clearer. But, the newfound clarity was a double edged sword. I had encountered both the Good and Evil within me and for a short time it seemed as if they were actually stuggling for dominance over eachother. Luckily I managed to maintain a healthy nuance between the two. I reflected on some of good and evil acts I had committed in the past and was able to Identify the forces behind them. Now I'm more aware of what each side is capable of if they go ignored. ", "As I slowly glided out of the foam, and back into my body, I remember telling myself that I couldnt forget what had happened to my mind. And that things would never be the same. (I was right) I stood up and realized that I was still tripping pretty hard, so I sauntered over to my friend Jeff, who seemed to be calming down as I was. Long story short, we watched TV for the rest of the night,compared experiences, saw Satan a few more times and haulled ass back to our hometown around noon. I tripped until about 6:00pm later that day for a grand total of roughly 22 hours..WEEEEEEEE! ", "It took me a few days to really break the whole experience down and analyze it thouroughly. I'm positive that I dont remember a good chunk of it. But I did bring back a good deal from that foamy void. The whole concept of thought without words has changed the way I use introspect.

This was not a wise idea.  Although I had fried 8-10 before, 15 was a substancial amount more than this.  The first effects started kicking in around 9:20 or so.  First mistake, a movie was being played, a horror movie.  horror movies are not good to be watching while on acid, so in a great deal of fear I asked them to turn it off.  They turned on some porn and this was much more relaxing.  ", "This whole time I was off in my own little world, my friend had left.  This was my second mistake.  One must always be with their ride or their friends on acid.  Being alone while on acid is bad, very bad.  So the acid is hitting me visciously, but I am enjoying it.  The walls are shaking, the patterns are covering my body.  It was quite intense, and I loved it.  Then a guy came to the party.  Someone I'd never met.  Someone told him I was on acid and he decided to 'fuck with me'.  Third mistake, dont be with anyone who will 'fuck with you'.

Fourth Mistake, never go on a walk while on acid alone, especially when frying hard.  I got to the end of the street and was immediately lost.  I had no idea where I was, what i was doing, and the greatest sense of horror I'd ever felt in my life came upon me.

I felt a great amount of love to everyone, even tho there was no one around at the time, except someone sleeping in another room.  I felt that everything was so perfect and that nothing should ever change.  I felt like I would never be unhappy again.  Everything fit together and was unified as one.  ", "This was a pretty moving experience for me.  I don't know if I've ever felt so content in my life.  I'm in the after affects as I write this.  I'm running on about an hour of sleep and am getting pretty tired.  There's still the 'I'm not all here; funny body feeling' all over me.  I must say it was definitely worth the experience.  I hope to have more like this one in the future.  I enjoy going deeper into the trip than just thinking, 'Oh this is cool dude, everything's moving.'  I mean, that part is very cool, but it means a bit more to me than just that.", "I had recently purchased a 100 hit bottle of liquid acid. ", "Preparations: I spent two days fasting and meditating to clear my head of a lot of mental baggage.", "9:00 pm: I dosed my first hit in the break room of my job, it is about half an hour before work is over. I cleaned up and sat on the steps waiting for the store to close down. The acid was just starting to have its preliminary effects when I left the store about 1/2 hour later.", "T+1 hour: I felt 'out there' but not fully tripping, I decided to take a walk up  to an apartment that my two friends live in. We go for a walk to the wharf to smoke a blunt and the sights, sounds, and smells of the city are nearly overwhelming to my acid-addled senses. I find the urban environment is very provocative when I am tripping... there are so many stimuli I can easily become lost. The walk back seems very surreal, we had a conversation with a man walking his dog and I couldn't tell if the dog was real or imaginary.", "T+4.5 hours: I take another hit of liquid. At this point I noticed a peculiar feeling of being a 'pilot in a ship.' That is my mind and body seemed to be separate, I had a sensation of existing within my body rather than it being a part of me. This is not the first time I've noticed this effect, a very dramatic demonstration of the mind/body interface.", "T+8 hours: I leave an apartment with friends after smoking heavily for several hours. My psychedelic effects are at their most intense, everywhere I look I can see rainbow auras shifting and glimmering. We decided to do a walking tour of Boston and set off to explore. We took a path leading through Beacon Hill's historic architecture down Commonwealth Avenue towards the campus of Northeastern. Along the way we admired huge glistening skyscrapers, temples, churches, and all the other idiosynchratic architecture of Boston. I felt my mind was primed to appreciate beauty in its rawest forms. The early morning breeze was extremely refreshing and as the sky began to gradually get lighter all the birds began to chirp. This feeling of nature awakening from slumber filled me with a good feeling, I reflected that after a tough New England winter the glories of spring were nearly upon us. At this point my mind turned inward and the rest of the trip I walked in silence contemplating the simple pleasures of life. I began to go over elements of my life and sifted through what is important to me. It was then that it dawned on me how my life is oriented and grounded through the relationship I built with my girlfriend. This filled me with an intensely pleasurable feeling of peace, serenity, and love. The world seemed to beam with an inner light, everything seemed wonderful. ", "T+10 hours: I returned to my building with my friends and we went to watch 'Caddyshack.' The movie was simply hilarious. I mean, it's a funny movie but the whole vibe of the acid was so overwhelmingly positive it just seemed like everything was extra enjoyable.", "T+12.5 hours: I crawled into bed and took out 'Obedience to Authority' which is a psychology book about an experiment conducted by Dr. Stanley Miligram at Yale. I felt like my mind was devouring the information and encoding it into my brain with ease. ", "T+16 hours: I awoke from a doze to find myself still lightly tripping. There was a slight feeling of things being just different. My carpet continued to have shifting patterns but otherwise there was no more visual element to what had been a decidedly visual trip. After eating a light lunch of salad I felt very good. My mindset was extremely relaxed and upbeat, and all the overwhelming problems from prior to the trip took a new and less dramatic perspective. The trip gave me a chance to really prioritize and think about what makes me happy. I felt it was an excellent introspective journey, as well as giving me astounding visuals at some points, and a greatly enhanced appreciation for the city around me. ", "Well, the effects have more or less completely subsided now at 3:45 the next day. I still have slight distortions in my visual field when I unfocus my eyes, but they are diminishing. This trip was a rare treat and I only wish most of mine could be so wonderful. I've never had a bad trip, but then again I don't always have SPECTACULAR trips like this one either.", "One night I hooked up with some friends to head to a rave.  We had been bored as can be, eating acid all long.  We kept dosing all the way to the party, finally got there and it fucking sucked.  There were like 50 people there, and the music was horrible.  After about an hour of that non-sense in the condition we were in, we decided to leave.  So were chilling in my old mini-van in the parking lot trying to decide what the hell we're gonna do witht he rest of our evening, I had the door open so to let a breeze in.  Before I know it some schmuck in plainclothes and a funny hat comes up to the open door and starts shining his damn flashlight around, asking why we diddn't stay at the party longer.  Needles to say my dumb ass had a small amount of pot in a baggie in the door cubby-hole type thing, that of course, he spotted.  Before I knew it he had drug me ass out the car and was telling me I'd better fess up to anything else I had before he started slashing seats.  ", "I remained calm, until he asked if that was my satchel in the car (which incedentally had a few hits of LSD on sugar cubes within) once he asked if it was mine, I simply said 'I have the right to remain silent, right?' boom I was in the cruiser.  They found the remainder of the 'vial' that we had been feeding on all day, and I was off to central booking.  Oddly enough, with my permission, they let my friends drive my car home once they were thouroughly searched.  The entire time while booking me in, redneck cops were telling me how I was going to be fucked in the ass for the rest of my days and making other lewd jokes about me being a homo-sexual raver who was going to spend the rest of his life in prison being being raped.  Finally they threw me in a temporary cell with a few other party kids who had fallen into similar situations that evening. I couldn't eat my meals and was in all around shitty times for the next three days, until I got bailed out.  Turns out these idiot cops had left a whole 'nother hundred doses and a bag of my friends pot undiscovered in my automobile.  ", "I ended up going to court, got off with a fifth degree felony, and am on probation to this day.  Shot the hopes I had of doing a gap year in Switzerland, and now I am stuck in shitty, miserable, small town, USA, just for one night's worth of fuck ups.  In the eternal words of Homer Simpson 'Do-oh!'", "I went to go see a concert at the Gorge Ampitheater and took some acid that just fell into my hands as I ran into a friend I hadn't seen in years.  It was during the day and I was tripping....I walked to a cliff and sat down on the top of it.....the wind suddenly gusted and I felt it enter my body....all of the sudden I felt the prescence of a friend of mine and then realized that he was there....it wasn't just a thought, but it was a shamanistic sort of connection. ", "We did not say anything to each other, just nodded in the affirmation that this was happening.....I began to cry as I realized what humans have the potential of doing but do not seem to be conscious of....the power of our minds can allow us to go anywhere our imaginations are capable of taking us to, and the presence of everyone you have ever met will always exist in your mind.", "I am writing this report after reading one by Dave, who described the same problems that I am having. Continuing long after last having taken acid there is this feeling of weirdness or 'the confusion'. Anyone else who can affirm this happening should submit a report as it is a very interesting side effect.", "Firstly, the curious thing about Dave's experience and my own are our ages. He writes that he is 15. I am 14. Maybe this has something to do with the haziness that's been affecting us and maybe not.", "Now for some background. Over the course of the past month and a half I have taken a total of 12 hits of acid. This has been an incredibly beneficial experience, bringing out amazing amounts of insight and a very definite motivation to become the most successful person I can be. Acid has played an important role in the course of my life.", "Now on to the side effect Dave and I have experienced. Ever since dosing, I have felt like there is a haziness to my perception of the world. Things seem different and confusing. Nothing makes any sense, even if I have found an answer and I know it is correct. When everything is explained perfectly, rationally I know that it makes sense, but I still don't understand. It is really hard to put this into words. Imagine the way that it feels when you are trying to figure out if there is a god (bad example, I know). No matter what you believe, even if you are sure you're right, it seems like there must be a deeper meaning to what you've discovered.", "I'll try to give a more rational example. Quite frequently I will think to myself, 'How did I get here? Why am I lucky enough to have realized that I can shape my life at such a young age?', to which the answer is 'You simply are. Whether it's random chance, or if you have a purpose, this is how it's happening.' ", "Alright, sure. The problem is that this answer only leaves me wondering 'Why?' even more. Ever since I've taken acid (all 12 hits were done in the space of 3 weeks), NOTHING makes any sense. Everything seems to have a deeper meaning that won't show itself. Rational answers leave me absolutely baffled.", "I feel disoriented. I have no way to place myself and no perspective. Proportions seem bizarre and I feel simultaneously insignificant and completely empowered (let me remind you this is under the influence of no drugs and I haven't dosed in several weeks). Objects won't just 'be'. When looking at a vending machine earlier, it was completely unbelievable to me that it existed. Why does it exist? How does it exist? Well, someone invented it of course. Why did someone invent it? To make money. How is it possible that someone invented it? And so on and so on. My brain absolutely will not stop having questions and I can never feel settled on an answer.", "OK, finally words are coming to me to summarize it. Everything, no matter what it is, seems to have a deeper meaning. No matter how far I analyze it, I still can't figure out why anything is the way it is. I feel infinitely curious. Answers are never satisfying anymore. (if I've been rambling these past few paragraphs maybe you'll understand how my thoughts keep tumbling over each other)", "At this point, I'm not certain what recommendation to make about LSD. On the one hand, it has led me to completely reforming the way that I am and my life will be a much happier one because of it. On the other hand, this permanent lack of understanding is driving me absolutely insane. The possibility of it being an underlying schizophrenia brought out by the acid (my family has a history of psychosis) absolutely scares the hell out of me. ", "What makes me satisfied with my decision to take it is this: If I had not done acid I would still be stuck in another type of haze -- not feeling in control of my life. Like so many other kids my age I was drifting aimlessly down the path of normalcy. Now I have taken first place in one of the largest debate tournaments in my state, have pulled up my grades, and am looking forward to my sophomore year. I will definetely continue to do acid, even if the consequence is this always-unsettled feeling.", "Hope this was helpful... It's important to document underage use of LSD, as there is currently very little on the subject. I encourage any other kids my age to submit their storys. Thank you to the Erowid team for making this site possible. Now I know I'm not alone in this problem.", "This was the first time I have ever taken LSD and it was the worst, and I will NEVER do it again, people say that it is the best feeling, and you can see objects that you could never see unless you are on the drug but what I saw and what happened to me wasn't a pleasurable experience...", "Friday night at a party me and 2 of my friends decided we were all 3 going to trip for the first time. So we were all partying smoking pot, having a good time. Then we we talked to this dude, and he said that he could hook us up with a few hits of LSD. We said 'how many should we take?' and the dude said 'Well if it is your first time, I wouldn't take more than 5' so we all took five a piece except for one of my friends only took 3. ", "So we were all still having a good time after we had taken our 5 hits, we went on partying still having a good time, and we weren't really feeling all of the side affects that everyone said we would. So then we went to go smoke up to try and get a better high. We smoke about 4-5 bowls, then went back to the party.", "EVERYTHING was different.  It was like I was in a different house, we had been gone away from the house about 2 hours and now it felt like I knew NOBODY!! I was afraid until my friend who only took 3 hits calmed me down, after about 5 minutes that seemed like 1 hour I was calm then we all went into the 'Trip-room'.  I will never forget this for the rest of my life. The room was designed for people who were tripping, and the more acid you took the more of a trip you would feel. I was sweating and I had cold chills and I was just so scared but I couldn't move my eyes from all of the lights and movements. My friend had put on a costume dressed as Chucky (from Child's Play). I hated that movie, I was so scared of it when I was a kid! It was him dressed up as Chucky but he was talkin in his real voice, so I thought he had turned into Chucky.", "It seemed so real and I tried getting a knife and stabbing him but nothing seemed to work I couldnt kill the mother fucker!! even though it was my friend behind the costume he had a bullet proof vest on and a thick protection cover underneath his costume so everytime I would stab him he would just come back at me saying 'I am the the devil and I am taking your soul' It scared the shit out of me and I couldn't stand it anymore so I left the room running down the street trying to hide because I didnt want him to take my soul I scared 'shit-less!!'", "I didn't know where to go I just knew that I had to get out of there. I finally stopped running and I looked behind me and everyone was gone I had left the party and walked about 2 miles down the road and I was at a gas station so I went in the gas station and tried to use the phone, but I couldn't remember the number to my friends cell phone, so I called up a different friend to get my out of that damn place. He said he would call the party and tell someone to come get me....well he called the party and told the guy that was wearing the Chucky costume to come pick me up. That was the end I was so freaked out.", "I was at the peak of my Trip and I couldn't stand it anymore.  I went into convulsions, and I started shaking and having a seizure! They all rushed me to the hospital and, the doctor gave me some kind of shot, and just told me to wait it out. It may not seem like that was scary but think about something that scared you when you were a kid and then have some dress up in that same costume. If it doesn't scare the shit out of you, then you didnt take Acid!", "I will never do LSD again and I am not saying that everyone shouldn't do it, just make sure you know how much to take the first time you do it, and be around people you are good friends with!", "one day my friend came back from Madison with some acid (i think like 10 hits) so me, him and my other friend all dropped. I didnt feel anything a few hours afterwords so i figured that it wasnt going to work...how wrong i was.. we took it during the day (it was still light out) and eventually (at night) to made our way outside of his apartment and proceeded to smoke a few joints. It wasn't five minutes later that it hit me. We walked through the hallway to the other side of the building and sat into my car. It was then that i looked at the steering wheel and it turned into a weird lookin funnel. There were black and white rings spiraling down into what looked like a neverending hole. i looked over totally freaked out and then i was like 10ft of in the distance hovering outside of my body with no control. ", "This was the shittiest feeling ive ever felt. At first i felt like i was watching some movie, then i realized that it wasnt a movie at all, instead it was me making an complete ass out of my self infront of my friends. After that i got out of the car (in slow motion) and was talking to my friend(he told me later i said i thought i was going to die) we then went inside where i laid on the floor for about 3-4 hours, every minute feeling like an eternity, thinking i was completely insane. I could see my myself in a straightjacket boucing off the walls in my padded room because thats where i was gonna be come day time when  everybody sees how crazy ive gotten, or at least thats what i thought. I just laid there with my mind racing, totally overcome by panic and fear, thinking i was some raving lunatic, and thought that id rather be dead than feel like that. In any manner it finally ended and i dont think ill ever try doing anything stupid like that again.", "This is one of the worst trips I have ever had on LSD. It is also one of the most important experiences I have had and has shaped the way I look at the workings of the human mind.", "This experience happened when I was 17 years old and I am now 23. At this time I had been experimenting with LSD for a couple years and had many deeply profound experiences previous to this 'event'. I had also had some terrible trips which had given me insight into the realm of true insanity and reality altering psychosis. Most of these other trips had been too chaotic and detached from reality for me to comprehend from a SANE perspective. They were more or less the most disturbing experiences of my life...but this experience brought a new meaning to 'BAD TRIP'.", "At this time in my life I was going to raves on a weekly basis. Me and my very close friends went to a party that was mostly dark and fast techno (hardcore). As far as set and setting goes this is a horrible mistake, but I was a young kid and did not know about safe and comfortable settings. Adding to the dark atmosphere was an overwhelming bad attitude coming from most people. I ate 2 hits of unknown blotter even though my tolerence for substances was/is EXTREMELY low. It turns out this was REALLY potent LSD as well.", "About 45 minutes after ingesting the doses I was in the bathroom watching a crack deal happen. At this point I am beyond the jittery 'coming on' effects, and I am starting to feel extremely altered. Someone selling crack at a party is the last thing I need to see so I go out into the barely lit main room and try to dance to the dark sounds coming out of the overdriven and distorting sound system. Within a few minutes reality begins to crumble in a way I had never experienced and would never experience again. All the sounds going into my head seemed to be perpetually dropping in pitch as well as the rate of the 'cycles' I heard/felt. Then all of a sudden I would realize that it was actually happening super fast but still dropping in frequency. This sound began to effect me physically. Pure terror started to creep over my mind and body. It was like the sound of decay at an unbearable volume breathing into my being. ", "From here on until I came back to reality time was an unknown concept and had no affect on my thought process. I remember wandering around suffering from deep dread and undescribable doom. This feeling can not be communicated in words. I found myself outside of the main room and at a small set of steps which led to a small platform and a lifesized crusified jesus. Turns out this rave was being put on in a community center where church services are held! That still disturbs me because of the type of energy which was manifesting at that party. Anyway, at this point I sort of collapse in front of this statue. And as the world slips further away I feel every part of my being die and begin to decay. ", "To this day I don't think I have felt as overwhelmed with fear and dread as i did then. I felt as though years and then decades and centuries passed within seconds as my physical form decayed into the earth which quickly covered 'me' up. It was almost like I was watching it happen in a time lapse video or stop animation. I look back on this as the symbolic death of my ego. Next, I remember being back at the party, but now all of the hundreds of kids are demonic/angelic entities and their focus is on me.  The music has stopped and a creepy energy is begining to pulsate out of the crowd. I know that they are trying to convince me of taking on a powerful role of some sort which I know is against all I stand for. I now find myself on the stage looking out into the crowd. (It is important that I mention that I was raised Catholic, but I had become a believer in a more chaotic higher power than the god I was taught about as a boy.) ", "Then, I felt as though 'they' were right and I should take on this role. This made me feel exulted and full of power and cosmic importance. The music came back on and it was glorious. Then, quickly I knew that this was wrong and that 'they' were tricking me into some kind of eternal damnation and the terror came back stronger than before. They knew I had changed my mind and the music stopped abruptly and was replaced by the 'evil energy'.I knew that my decision had eternal and cosmic consequence and that the 'wrong' decision would be the end of EVERYTHING. ", "This continued for what seemed like eternity untill I 'woke up' outside in the car we came in with all my friends looking at me, half amused and half terrified. At this point I realized I had been saying the word 'heaven' over and over again. It felt like a mantra that I had to repeat to get 'out' of the place I was trapped in (the darkest depthes of my mind). I came down almost instantly from a peak and being back in the real world was shocking and terrifying because then I understood what I had just gone through in a more 'conscious' state of mind. I told everyone right there to never let me injest LSD ever again. ", "Needless to say I did continue experiments in the world of psychedelics and have had experiences that were quite the opposite of this one. I felt much peace and unity with the universe since that event, but that experience was the most seperated from the 'essence of life' that I have ever felt. ", "This event taught me about how important the mind set and the environment around you are while playing with the chemicals in your head. It also made me realize how much a hallucinogenic experience can teach you about your perception of the world as well as your subconscious struggles. It made me see how much I am a part of the universe and how everything I do affects everyone and everything. I continue on my path to this day (however infrequently it happens)... THE EVOLUTION OF PERCEPTION...", "I will never forget my first and only experience with LSD.  One night after work my ex-friend called me.  He asked if I wanted to come over and go on a trip.  I was very excited and I rushed over.  When I got there my friends (we will call D.B. and J.K. were there along with a boy who I did not know.  D.B. pulled out six hits of an acid called Dancing Condoms, it was a puzzle with little dancing condoms on it.  It was me and the other boy's first time so we only took a half of a hit. I waited about 45 minutes and nothing was happening.  I noticed that the other boy was acting very weird.  I thought maybe the acid was fake so I took the rest of the dancing condom and 3/4 of a hit of white blotter.", "A little later D.B. went to get some bud.  When he got back we smoked 1 good sized bowl.  About a minute after the bowl I was feeling very fucked up.  At first I felt very high and started to laugh at evrything.  D.B. and I went back to his room to get another bowl.  I was sitting on his bed and I dazed off I had thoughts of life and death without even trying to think about it.  Suddenly the whole room caved in on me and I came out of the daze.  D.B. kept talking to me but I didn't even know where I was.  I could not comprehend why I was this fucked up.  I looked at the pot and all I saw was pine needles.  I asked D.B. if that was what we smoked and he asked me what I was talking about. I looked again and It was regular marijuana.", "We went in the living room and sat down.  I kept dazing off and suddenly the room went dark ond colors of neon green and pink were everywhere.  I felt like I was all alone and nobody else realy existed but they were all just images.  I was looking at my arms and they turned into clay and crumbled to the ground.  Everybodies hair was changing color and everyones faces were scrambling around.  I was feeling very scared.  D.B. took me in the other room and he kept yelling at me.  He told that the demons were coming and I was going to go to hell.  Suddenly I saw a flash of light and D.B. became a demond.  The vains were popping out of his head and his eyes were dripping blood and hirns came out of his head.  I started talking to J.K. and he calmed me down he told me it was from the acid and D.B. was just trying to scare me.  In the middle of our talk his face formed into another demon and he was screaming at me.  I was looking at the walls and it was covered with huge pentagrams.  After a few hours of running through the house screaming I finally came down. ", "After that, ever time I smoked weed I saw designs on the walls.  I started to trip one time after 2 gravity bong hits.  The room was melting and I was extremely paranoid.  If I didn't have a bad trip my first time I would probably do it again, but out of fear I will never take it again.", "My most memorable 'trip' is one that now occupies my every thought and action.  It has entirely changed my perceptions of existence, evolution, spirituality, conciousness.  It was an experience at home, there were three of us.  I took only one hit.  We set the atmosphere by lighting with blacklights and candles, and we listened to goa music (some call it psychedelic trance).  ", "I felt the acid creeping on, the giddyness, the happiness, the visuals, dancing and moving with the fluidity that acid provides.  As I was dancing in a room by myself, I was struck with a feeling that could only be described as divine.  I began to sense that inside me there were two selves.  Perhaps it is incorrect to separate the two, but in order to illustrate my point here, I will do so.", "We have a face to the world, we have our personalities, our likes and our dislikes, our ambitions, and our fears.  We have our insecurities as well.  But this divine self in us knows not of insecurity.  It is a feeling almost equal to pride, only it is not egotistical, it is not arrogant, it's not a feeling of 'Look...I'm better than you'...it's a feeling of 'LOOK...I'm equal to you...and aren't we fabulous!!'...it is divine. :)  Each of us is divine, but our perceptions of ourselves become muddled in this world by fear, and prejudice, and society...blame it on whatever, we lose that connection to our spiritual/subconscious selves.", "Once I had discovered this, I had new clarity, new purpose, new focus and understanding.  I realized that this being is my consciousness.  From there, I lay down, closing my eyes.  Exotic patterns circled through my mind, changing in color and shape with the music.  At first it was two dimensional, and then it became three dimensional, and I seemed to travel into the patterns, until I was inside the very 'fibres' of that pattern, and then it was a molecule, and then I was inside the atom, and then inside the sub-atomic particle....until I realized that I was no longer aware of my physical body.  I was like a mind, floating in space...hehe...rather, I was like eyes...exploring.", "I could look out into the vastness and see only energy, see all worldly things, as the same energy.  It was in this vast nothingness (allness), where I realized that my conciousness could travel wherever it pleased.  That one could still be self-aware, without being physical.  That the physical world is only ONE state of being.  I realized that when the physical body dies, if we are in control of our own consciousness, we can still be aware, and exist in another state.  Therefore, there is no such thing as death.", "I saw life as energy, all things are just energy in a different form.  What makes a human different from another form is that we have a consciousness, and we are self-aware.  I realized many things.  I believe that we choose our parents.  I believe that our spirits are constantly evolving.  All these things I don't just believe...but I know.  What is true for me, is not necessarily true to another.  There is a huge difference between believing, feeling, and knowing.  Before, I believed and felt the concepts of reincarnation, of different states of consciousness, of energies.  Now, at last, I have seen.", "I floated back to the physical world, back to 'reality', only to go to bed shortly after.  I fell into lucid dreaming for the first time, which was fascinating.  I woke up feeling rested, yet knowing full well I had been self-aware the whole time, I had been 'awake' and exploring.  The lucid dreaming continued for two days afterwards.", "There isn't much that can make me unhappy these days, as I am more in control of my own reality.  I look forward to my next 'trip', I look forward to expanding my understanding.  Such experiences must not only be recognized, but taken and applied to life.  I can only continue to evolve.", "1995 was the year of acid for me, a doorway into places i am certain i dreamt about in my childhood, crystal dimensions, where i could taste colors and touch sounds and smells  with my hands from the very first trip on, i felt great amounts inhibitions and unresolved issues from my shitty  past leaving me,literally'enlightening' me. i was like a snake shedding skin and slithering into a newer safer place. i stopped being afraid of who i had become. in August i had my most important trip yet. a few weeks after my 18th birthday, my then-boyfriend, D, another friend, G, and Buddha Ben (D's brother) decided we would 'visit other galaxies'. it was Buddha Ben's first trip, so we were excited about the initiation, as we always had an amazing time on acid, even all by ourselves.", "it was a breathtakingly perfect Wednesday night, and already the night was charged with a full moon under the cool jewelled Southern skies.we were set!! we popped a tab each in the evening,and proceeded to have dinner', perched in front of the tube, of course, a hilariously complex fiasco. i had forgotten how to handle cutlery. i stared to tingle a little,then the chicken on my plate was acting up!i had vivid impressions it would start tweaking on the plate and bleeding a la Lynch's 'Eraserhead'. I regarded this vision with much morbid curiousity. next to me, G was staring at D's mom who was eating away with extreme Fascination! i looked to see if anyone else's trip had kicked in and the look on their faces gave it away! I could've sworn G mouthed 'i'm on fire!' (later he claimed it was 'Good UK shit'.no connection whatsoever!!) Eyescheck?? they were glazed and ready to roll! we grinned at each other, a secret code. D's mom looked at us strangely,and sort of yelled that none of us had touched dinner. she became fuzzy,mouth open and shutting, volume fading --i had muted my boyfriend's mom at last, i thought triumphantly! suddenly,i pointed out that we were watching the ballet on TV; the male ballerinas started flying across the screen , lilac tights over monstrous bulges.we collapsed into uncontrollable laughter, which set me flying!! D's mom caught on finally. Sensing a vile nagging , we took off into the night, taking with us the usually  extremely-calm Buddha Ben(hence the name), who was starting to take on a maniacal look in his face, as he hummed the 'wizard of Oz' song. walking into the hills ,we suddenly stumbled upon a poster for a lost gala in the dirt road, which appealed to G and became G's 'quest' for the night. I started to have 'trails' now, and as D skipped around, he morphed into a human slinky before me. ", "we walked aimlessly, searching for the Wizard of Oz and a lost gala (reward:200 dollars,we agreed would be spent on more acid, naturally). i settled into the moment with a sigh...the world became butter smooth.i began to sense the onset of my peak and within minute, i began detaching myself from my body. during the odd reality  i was amazed that we were even walking, it seemed surreal!!", "The temperature dropped sharply and the night turned frosty, the fog trailing all around us in pastels. i stopped breathing for a while so i wouldn't shatter this moment of intense beauty. suddenly, my boyfriend and i mysteriously found ourselves alone! G and BB had stumbled off somewhere in my brief moment of reverence.", "D and I walked to a huge oval field, surrounded by a dense forest of eucalyptus on one side i noticed was breathing softly..there was an electric stillness in the area. I could not register the cold in my body though mentally i KNEW it was freezing!! D and I looked at each other in frozen silence, reading each other's minds. BANG!from this point on, we felt our experience becoming one and the same!", "It hit us at once. Naturally,we both had a quest too.I had lost my pregnancy two weeks ago, and today's purpose was to let go. we approached this seemingly dreary mission  with intense peace and love. Looking up, I saw an overpoweringly large dome of rainbow criss-crossing and enveloping us.. From  the middle of the field, a silver chord leading into the eternal nightsky. i fell in and out of sounds and sights,at some point i had a conversation with the child i had lost, voices whispered from beyond the sphere; it was so sad and elating at the same time. throughout this 'ceremony', D watched me, sitting on the wet grass, nodding occasionally each time a peaceful thought crossed my mind and spoke to me. at this point, time had distorted severely for us, seconds stretching into hours and hours of conversations with the Universe.", "to date, this is the most intense encounter i have EVER had on acid!!!a real rush, not unlike large doses of speed..after i felt totally cleansed, we walked the streets and into a 24-hour gas station, where we met some old friends. I felt like 5 years old and noted i could see AURAS around everyone!!!I paid for a fizzy dizzy Coke and told the gas attendent, with a huge hug, things will be ok!! (i saw so much RED around him.) he looked at me all puzzled for a few seconds(??!) then  broke into a smile and said thanks.", "we glided on  home, agreeing we were both coming down now. when we got there, BB and G were sitting on the caravan roof with beers,in hysterics and howling at the moon. As we sat down and smoked a fat joint, they told us they had gatecrashed some teenybopper party in the next suburb and had a brilliant time dancing and 'laughing their bloody arses off!!!', (even though they didn't get laid!, BB added). we sat there for an hour or so, coming down to Pink Floyd playing from the elderly neighbor's house(which was highly odd since that was a strictly Elvis zone!).", "the cold finally hitting, D and I went into his room,and switched on the radio. some Balinese music was playing. The joint must've set us off because the woodchimes sent colours across the room back and forth. we launched into a lets-pretend-it's-the-doorbell game, sending us into hysterics through an hour long tune. under the covers, to celebrate our 'letting go', we had very emotional, yet detached 'can't feel my dick' sex. I never felt closer, yet never felt further apart from D. throughout sex, I smelt sandalwood all over the place, on our bodies, in the music.. Later,i lay awake for an hour with another joint,trying to join D in sleep. Instead, the sun started to set behind a black cat in a poster on the wall! i closed my eyes briefly, a pleasant shock as i thought the acid had worn off. Obviously not. I spiralled into a rapidly morphing, technicolor world, flowers exploding into colours exploding into spirals and cuboids..infinite images evolving and taking over.I allowed myself to fall into the endless impressions-SUUUUuuuuccCCK!-- eventually 'yen' sleep took over my exhausted mind, a delicious smile fixed on my face.", "A couple of months ago 2 of my friends and myself decided that we wanted to take some acid over christmas break. I have used acid before in higher doses than the one we decided to take, so I was not worried or anything like that. We dropped the acid at about 10:00 P.M. at night. Within 20 min the acid was definately kicking in for me and my one friend (we'll call him N). We were all well aware that set and setting are essential when it comes to tripping so we all agreed that we felt comforatable at N's house. Within an 1 hour my visuals started to become clearer to me. It was a great trip for the first 2 hours. Naturally everything was moving. The walls were breathing , and the ground looked like a huge tidal wave that would always rise higher and higher but right before it would hit me it would shrink down to nothing. ", "A million thoughts raced through my head throughout the whole trip. I remember just wanting the trip to get more intense every second. My friends and I thought that there was no better way to do that than to smoke some dank weed. And to our luck we had just purchased 30 dollars a gram weed. We decided to smoke it out of the basement window. By this time i was totally out of it , but that didn't stop us from chiefing up. The bowl eventually made its way over to me. I remember taking a huge hit and as i went to blow the smoke out the window i lost my balance (because i was tripping so hard) and knocked one of the alarm bars off of my friends window. During that split second I remember getting the most paranoid and fearful feeling in my entire life. My one friend (we'll call him J) reacted quick to the situation and told N about what happened. At this time N went upstairs to turn the alarm off. But he thought it would be funny to say that the cops were on their way. When I think about this now, I realize that he didn't understand YOU DON'T MESS WITH PEOPLES MINDS WHEN THEY ARE TRIPPING BALLS!!! ", "So anyways I was trying to clean up and my friend was saying 'Fuck it we're caught, lets just finish smoking this bowl.' At this time I completely lost it. I almost broke down right there. I saw my whole life end at that moment. The thought of getting caught with acid , and dank weed by the cops terrified me. I thought everything hit rock bottom. Instead of panicking, because in the back of my mind I thought in some weird way this was just part of the trip or something else related to the drug, i didn't scream or run or do anything. Instead I sat in the corner of the couch with the most emotionless faces I have ever conceived. By this time, the smarter of my 2 friends J had calmed me down and told me that it was a joke. After I realized that my visuals of the trip became even more intense. ", "I think that somehow I got so scared it made me flip out hardcore in my mind. The rest of the trip I really enjoyed but I still will never forget that feeling of fear, and I will always remember to trip with only people I trust 100% and who know how to handle themselves with hallucinogens....", "When i turned nineteen (summer of 98) i was a heavy acid user.  i had just found out that i had impregnated  my ex-girlfriend and was somewhat of an alcoholic loser.  However, we were getting really good lsd mailed from out west, and i was eating a fair bit of it.  over the course of the year i ate it about every weekend, usually 3-8 hits.  i would constantly feel someone hovering over my shoulder and whispering something in my ear.  i couldn't tell who it was but knew it was a girl. this happened approximately 5-7 times over the course of the year.  ", "the following summer me and my friend got drunk and decided to injest 30-40 drops each.  it was scary but interesting.  the same thing happened but this time i realized that it was my ex-girlfriend because i could see, feel, hear and smell her. i had gone to visit our child that day for only the second time in 3-4 months. within two weeks i cut my hair, got a job, and started working on getting my girlfriend back.  ", "two long months later we were back together, but the coolest part was about three months after that.  When we had just finished making love on a", "january night she whispered the same thing i had heard those many lsd-induced times before.  we have been together ever since.", "I am by no means a writer and some of my accounts of this story may seem hazy and Chaotic but this is the best way for me to describe this experience. I`d been Joy Trippin for like 10 or 12 years but nothing was ever quite like this. It was February of 1998. The day stared off normal enough as I woke up, grabbed for my pack of Ports and the phone. I made some calls and headed out the door by 2 in the afternoon with my friend Theresa. We made it into Austin at about 3 and went downtown to chill with some Kidz on the Drag for a few hours. Some Kid told us about a party that night so that became our goal for the evening. The party itself went off without a hitch and all was good catchin up with some Kidz I hadn`t seen in a while and doin some doses. I don`t usually make it a point to keep track of how many hits I`ve taken but I`m sure it was somewhere around 50 paper doses. At any rate I was informed before the night was over to come to this girl Heidi`s (R.I.P.)house the next day if I was gonna be in town at around 5 cause my friend Tre had somethin in mind for me. ", "It was on. Theresa and I went on back home and slept for a few hours woke up showered and chilled for a while. We made it back to Austin around 6:30(fashionably late)and no sooner made it in the door as my friend Tre said 'open up Kid'. He dosed me about 10 drops of the Sickest Liquid I`ve ever come across. We chilled there for a while and by 7 were out the door to another friends house. The Trip started to set in a little within an hour but it was a feeling I had never experienced before. I felt really uptight and on edge so I smoked some hydro and tried to relax. No dice. This feeling went on for almost 4 hours and I was feeling pretty sick pretty much just thinkin it was bad acid but not wanting to say anything to Tre to Dis his shit. Tre decided it was time to set his plan in motion and asked us if we were ready to go. I asked him where to and he just smiled. O.K. no biggie,this is Tre...so off we went. Me, Theresa, Tre and his Girl. Our destination turned out to be a Howard Johnson Motel in Austin on the top floor of all places. ", "Like I said I was feelin pretty bad so goin to the top floor didn`t seem like all that much Phun. When we got to the room Tre told me there was someone he wanted me to meet. I asked him who right as the door opened.  I wasn`t sure who this Cat was but I was sure I`d seen him before. He let us in the room and we all exchanged greetings and all that jazz. After a few minutes of chit chat this person that I`ll call F. asked me if I`d like to do some drops with him. I told him I`d taken 10 already and he asked me if I was still sick. Feeling Puzzled I said yeah why?(Thinkin maybe somethin was really wrong with this situation). He asked Tre how long ago I dosed and when Tre told him about 4 hours he said I`d feel better soon and once again asked me if I wanted to do some doses. At that point(and I don`t know why) I said sure. He asked me how many and I got all cocky and said whatever`s clever (big mistake). He came over to me with a vial, bit the tip off and squirted it into my mouth. I instantly started geekin in my mind but held it in to at least look like I was keeping my composure. He then did the same for himself. A few minutes later the sickness was actually going away replaced with an intense feeling of warmth. Tre and F. spoke amongst themselves as I spoke with Theresa who had also done about 30 or 40 drops herself. During this time Tre was tellin F. of how I had always wanted to Spin Out and had never manged to get there even though it wasn`t uncommon for me to eat a sheet or more at a time. F. came back over to me and talked about it with me a bit before offering me the chance I`d always wanted. Put on the spot of it I was a little scared at first but I`m sure it was just the realization of what I had already taken was starting to mess me up pretty bad. I agreed not really knowing what was gonna take place in the next few minutes as I started trying to convince myself I`d be ok. F. pulled out a different batch of vials along with a bottle of 2 fingered tequila (that I later found out was full of Un-Cut Liquid) and carefully put different amounts of (unmeasured)doses in each of 6 vials. Not knowing exactly how much was in each one.He had me sit in a chair, place my hands on my lap and tilt my head back when he started pouring the vials in my mouth and on my face. When he was finished he gave me a hug followed by one from Tre and wished me well on my journey. I relaxed a bit and started to fall into the groove of things for a few minutes when it hit me all at once.", "At first it was very peaceful, I started to drift off out of consciousness a bit and was experiencing visuals at an unheard of level, but about 5  minutes later something went wrong.I fell into a complete panic. I started feeling as though I couldn`t breathe. I looked around the room and not wanting anyone to know I was panicking I closed my eyes and tried to ride it out as with any other trip. No dice. In my head I saw blood everywhere and saw myself losing it and starting to kill people that were in the hotel room with me. I opened my eyes again and jerked my head from side to side trying to find a way out of this mindset. I told myself that I needed to get out of the room before I lost it and jumped up and reached for the door. I made it about halfway out the door when I had the feeling and thought in my head that I was telling myself that I would jump (remember I`m on the top floor). I jumped back in the door slamming it and put my back against the door as I slid down it to the ground. Every bad thing that people had told me could happen ran thru my mind and I felt them all happening to me at that point. Tre looked over at me and asked me how I felt and if I was ok. I told him no. He asked me what was wrong and I told him i was scared. He tried to assure me that there was nothing to be afraid of and that it was just my mind trying to let go and that I was trying to hold it back and should just let it go. I put my hands to my head and started crying squeezing my head. At this point he knew something wasn`t right and grabbed F.`s attention to let him know that I was geekin. F. came to me and sat down on the floor beside me, he offered me a bowl and tried to talk to me a bit. I wasn`t comprehending anything and my heart was racing. He helped me up and had me sit in the chair I had started out in. (This is where it got crazy) He had me close my eyes and started placing peaceful thoughts in my head to help me relax as reality was floating away quickly (all this happened within 10 to 15 minutes from the point he splashed me)", "He decided this wasn`t going to work and had everyone either leave or be quiet.He took hold of my hand and led me somewhere in my mind I`d never been. He was telling me kinda what to look for and when I found it I let him know. He asked me if I was there and I told him I was. All I could see was a tornado of different colored numbers and letters. He talked to me very calmly and led me back to a point where I was somewhat in grips with what was going on.(more or less I`d say this has to be close to being hyptnotized)I couldn`t believe this was happening.It couldn`t be real.I tried to make sense of it in what little mind I had left but it was no good.This went on for about 20 minutes. Just him talking to me and takin me for a ride (I`d heard of this happening but never believed it was real). When he brought me out I seemed to understand alot more of what was going on around me and things were clearer but I insisted that none of this was real. I quickly put it out of my mind just thankful to be feeling somewhat better but it wouldn`t last for long. He had just gotten me thru the onset of it all. A little later we left there on a mission to get some Meth from another Cat across town. I was feeling really mellow when we left not really thinking about things too much. Just kinda goin with the flow of thoughts of peaceful things that F. had fed me.", "When we got to this Kidz appartment I realized quickly that this was a set up. They opened the door and told us to come in but the first thing I saw was a kid hiding in the hall and the barrel of a shotgun barely sticking out. I turned and looked at another kid who had a gun in his pants. As I started to bolt Tre also saw what was going on and started to run also. I took a few running steps and rather that go down the stairs I jumped from the second level walkway. Tre ran down half the stairs before looking back and seeing them start to come after us. I was already in the car and was starting to pull out while opening his door for him to jump in. As we started down the road 2 gunshots rang out and my mind went with them. I don`t know how we made it back to the hotel but we did and right then and there I lost it. I lost all track of everything in my mind. Nothing was real.I don`t really know how to expalin it without sounding like a fool but oh well. I lost myself as a physical being. I didn`t exist. No one did. Nothing was real. No shapes no thoughts,nothing. I was lost in a space of colors. Beautiful colors coming and going from every direction. Not a single thought existed. I was told that what it looked like is that I`d fallen into a Trance and about 20 minutes into it they said I just passed out. Out of fear of what had happened earlier no one wanted to call an ambulance and have everyone all freaked out so F.had some of the people there take off just in case anything happened to me so they wouldn`t be involved. I was that close to death becoming a reality and didn`t even know it.", "I awoke several hours later completely delirious.  Not being able to make any sense of anything. My ability to speak was gone only to be replaced by jibber jabber baby talk. I stayed like that for a couple of hours (while I was told later everyone sat around watching me hoping I`d be ok but not really knowing if I would or not). (I was also told of the baby talk as they called it as I had no recollection of it) After that I passed out again and everyone started to panic a bit. This went on with me waking up and passing out the whole morning, day and half of the next night. I finally started to come out of it a bit when I heard the phone ring. I looked around and asked everyone what was going on. I was still really out of it but I had some senses of things. I smoked a bowl with some help and they managed to feed me a bit when it hit me again. This time I understood things a lot better but was still not in my right mind. By the morning I was able to get in the car to start making my way home. 'Finally' I thought. I was able to drive so I figured I must be ok. Everyone thanked me for giving them the scare of their lives as Theresa and I left the hotel. Halfway home we noticed a DPS Trooper right on our bumper. Not good. I was able to maintain some kind of mindset to keep the car straight and that he was just running the tags to make sure we were all good. Whew!! We were and he went on his way. I had trouble getting used to being anywhere but the hotel for hours when we got back to my friends apt. and by the evening time headed back for Austin still trippin. We hooked up with Tre and his girl and rented a room where Tre and I proceeded to match and raise each other on doses the whole night with both of us passing out and waking up over and over again. You`d think I would have learned something or been afraid but after all I had already been thru nothing seemed impossible. I don`t know what exactly happened to me on that trip but I haven`t been the same person. I lost some of my edge on things that I don`t understand. I can`t explain what I saw. It was religious, it was eternal, it was pure insanity. I learned some things during this time though I`m still not really sure what they were. I don`t know if I would recomend anyone doing this without putting some serious thought into it first. I could have died and it didn`t cross my mind until I was faced with the reality of it.", "Raw Liquid is about as pure as it gets aside from getting dusted from a crystal and None of us are really sure how much I was given. F. isn`t even sure and was upset with himself for not being more careful. I`m alive and it`s all good but I don`t know if I`d ever do it again. It took almost 2 months for me to feel normal and get some of the things I had seen out of my head and to this day I`m still not the same person I was when I got up that day to drive to Austin. Getting Spun is something that can easily get out of hand. This is a very dangerous thing to do. Not knowing the exact Mics you`ve ingested can be fatal, and with Liquid it`s hard to say. Keep that in mind if you decide to venture any further than just weekend Joy Tripping. It`s so much more than that. It`s an Experience. One of a lifetime for me I think. Omega", "It was about 2 months ago. I had just recently bought a vial of acid. Having only a small portion left, me and my friend J decided to take the rest of it. My vial was in a small sweet breath bottle. I dropped 2 hits on J's tounge. Then I went to drop it on my tounge and nothing but air came out. I was extremely pissed at this point. I knew my friend was to soon be tripping and I was going to be able to enjoy it with him. I knew there had to be some acid still on the tip of the bottle. So, I licked all around it and immediately tasted the acid. I put the tip of the vial up to my mouth. I sucked in while squeezing the bottle. What ever acid remained in the vial was now in my mouth. I could taste it! ", "Me and J rolled up a blunt and started to smoke, waiting for our trips to kick in. I started to feel the 'butterflies' within about 10 minutes of my dose. I knew I was about to be FUCKED up!!! I asked J if he was feeling anything yet. He said no. The butterflies got stronger and stronger. I knew that this was going to be CRAZY! I knew this trip was about to blow my mind.", "Now, I was starting to get a little scared at this point. This was the 5th weekend in a row that I had tripped. I was kind of shady about doing it in the first place. I was getting the feeling like I was going to flip out. This made me even more nervous about the upcoming trip. All I could think about was that I was going to go crazy. After all, who knows how many hits I took. I thought I took too much. I have never felt butterflies like that before. ", "All I could do was stare at the floor while this amazing feeling crept up my body. J noticed I was acting a little weird and asked if I was ok. I said yes, I'm just feeling the acid start to kick it. He said ok and held out his arm to pass the blunt to me. Just as I put my hand out to grab the blunt from him, his arm started melting. It looked like hot candle wax, just dripping onto the floor. Pretty soon his whole body melted and was soaked up into the carpet. I was like WHAT THE FUCK!! I could hear his voice asking me if I was ok. I knew it was just a hallucination so I closed my eyes to get back to reality. I opened my eyes once again and it was 10 times worse. All I saw was white. I was in a completely white room. ALONE!!! All that was in there was me and the couch I was sitting on. It was like in the Matrix when Morpheus brings Neo into the computer and they are in the white room. I can still hear J talking to me. I look straight ahead and I see a tiny white light. All of the sudden it just gets bigger and bigger. Then it shoots out at me. Just like in the Matrix when all the gun racks shoot out at Neo in the white room. I felt a thump on my chest and I was back in reality.", "Reality was much more different than what it should be. When I came out of my trance I was tripping nutz. Everything was moving, waving, and jumping around. I felt like I was in a cartoon. I was tripping so bad my stomach started to hurt. I felt like I was going to throw up. I went and sat by the toilet then realized I wasn't going to throw up. My stomach was growling cause I hadn't eaten all day. ", "So, me and J went into the kitchen to cook some food. At this moment he wasn't tripping yet. He told me he was going to eat a left over steak and I could eat whatever I could find. I decided I wanted some hot dogs. He heated me up two. When they were done we realized he was out of buns. I had to make use of what we had. I was so fucked up I took tortillas, spread ketchup all over them and rolled the hot dogs in them. About half way through this crazed idea J had started to trip himself. So, we were both really fucked up. He had a nice steak and I had hot dogs wrapped in tortillas. I looked and my creation and looked at J and said 'what have I done?' He looked at me and just laughed. ", "We went into his room because DragonBall Z was about to come on. We figured it would be the perfect thing to watch while tripping. Believe me, IT WAS!!! The fast motions, bright colors, and intense fighting scenes put us in complete euphoria. It looked like the whole TV was shaking. I saw the fighters jump out of the screen and practically onto the bed. It looked like minature men where fighting on my lap. It was crazy!", "After DBZ me and J went to smoke another blunt. Then we realized we were both tripping way too hard to even begin to roll a blunt. So, we called some homies of ours to come over so they could do it. They show up about 30 minutes later. They roll up a blunt and we smoked it. Then we got our friend D to lick the inside of the vial. This was his first time to trip and it was great to see him that fucked up. He was running around like most first timers do. Amazed at what he was seeing.", "Me and J walked into the garage and found a big bottle of fruit bunch that said 100% vitamin C on it. We had heard that vitamin C increases your trip so we proceeded to drink it. It did increase my trip pretty well. We went outside and everything was wavy. The trees looked like kaleidescope images. I looked at his porch lights and saw rainbow colored streams shooting out at me. The feeling was incredible. I was in such a euphoria. It was the best feeling I have ever felt. I was truely in a perfect world. Surrounded by good friends with a great feeling. I was in a totally different world. ", "Although I don't know how many hits I took it must have been around 7 at least. This was some dank acid too. Really good shit. I could tell right away. Well, that's my story. Be safe and have fun.", "Over a period of four years I took LSD frequently, usually in the company of a close friend , occasionally solo. I was not on a sacred quest for 'truth,' nor did I have any scientific curiosity to test. My motivations were boredom and the desire to be entertained.", "I'd had anxious moments on acid; questioned by police at 3am in the blackness of Snowdonia wilderness, nausea and paranoia, terminal depression at lowly self after backfiring tape 'experiment' ( really exercise in vanity--what did we expect to hear, erudite scholars??!!). Whether belief was actual or deluded, there was always a semblance of 'control.'", "This one time I was working in a deli, finished at 7, summer night, scored some skunk, went to this friend's. Dropped a tab, chain smoked three big fat skunk bombers. Sat there, stoned before I'd finished the first. Put some music on headphones, can't remember what, this was about 9. Thinking, this is pretty strong. Something panoramic kept insisting itself. Felt like a Neanderthal. Felt saturated by the tremendous excitement at the epic scale of existence. The more intoxicated I felt, though, the more a kind of treacle-like animation came to me. Felt like I was sitting in the bottomless universe, not a room. The acid started kicking in--makes my jaw feel anaesthetised. My friend had been tripping for a couple of hours and was ok (we get pretentiously philosophical when we're on acid, possibly a bad idea--like navigating white water rapids on a sheet of sugar paper!). The conversation must have bent round that way; I really forget the details.", "Well into the peak I was beginning to feel dangerously overloaded. I was gripped by something, I could hardly hear the music in the background. I wasn't panicky at this stage, but I was beginning to feel like I was heavily tripping and it was getting stronger and stronger, faster and faster. I started to struggle at this point. ", "Then I looked up. This was the peak of the trip. Orbiting above was  (I was convinced and am still reluctant to deride) an 'Awakeness' --a mindfulness, an empty awake, as indescribable as it was 'unformulated.' A molecular cathedral, not just structural but conscious. It was like watching a vast supertanker come into harbour--silent, majestic, powerful. The Secret tapestry, the first amphibian eye, the algorithmic gristle of consciousness.", "I recall my friend sat at my side, indiscernible, a smudge through a broken lens. He must have stood up and decided to turn on the lights. At the instant the lights came on I panicked, horrifically. I don't really know what happened. In my sensitive state, the sudden influx of visual input...I don't know.  I was hosed down with alarm.  You know the glass chambers with a rubber glove in the side used for handling dangerous materials ? I felt like my existence--my self--had been slipped into something like the rubber glove. Visually everything was two dimensional. Reaching my hand out into no depth, perspective foreshortening seen as literal shapes. Everthing shimmering and changing in a visual soup of colour fields. My friend instantly saw I was in a bad way, and stuck with me and tried to comfort me through it. I found myself drinking water, the sensation just numbness at the point on the painting where my mouth was. He tried to cook something to take my mind off it, but I couldn't eat and I got mildly hung up that he was offended by this. He showed me a photograph of his baby niece; I remember thinking, 'that's just part of the process, nothing to get cute about.' Cycles of panic attack were hitting me, felt like they were going to explode. It was horrific, I felt completely mis-wired, the fit was too tight.", "Come dawn I was still panicking badly, but felt like I could just keep on top. I cycled home at about 7 in the morning, still going. It took me till 3 in the afternoon to sleep, which I did briefly for about 40 minutes. Upon awakening, I sensed something had been irreparably alterered. I didn't feel 'out' of the trip, it wasn't like a comedown. Any comedown I had was like the abatement of a swelling after something new has been grafted on. I remember seriously thinking, 'I can't live like this.' For the next six months I was plagued by panic attacks--they'd seize me anywhere, and anything would set them off. If I stared at anything for long enough I would panic. I cannot touch anything that is mildly hallucinogenic, even weed,  otherwise I start tripping again for hours, and it's always horrific.", "Thinking about acid now. Surely, it's a tool, a means to reveal that there are other ways of thinking and examining perception. But what are we going to do with that knowledge? Brains are going to change. Maybe acid won't affect them one day.", "It had been a typical night, one which had started off as usual. Many of us huddled around the bong, waiting for the LSD to arrive.  Every person who entered who was not 'Junior' our dealer was a complete disappointment.  After endless bongloads and beer, he finally walked in the door. The evening had begun.", "  I am not a rookie to LSD, but this was definitely the most interesting experience I have ever had. After taking my first two tabs (paper) i sat down and we began to watch 'The Cell,' a movie we had been told was 'awesome when you are tripping.' After about a 1/2 hour, everyone was getting a little antsy and beginning to feel the effects coming on. We were in awe at the movie, but i was really wanting to hear Led Zeppelin the entire night.  I requested it to be played, but 'ssshhhh! we're watching the cell' was always the answer. After a few more fans arrived, we eventually started with the boxed set. Our hippie friend Christine had brought up her color changing flower (the kind you buy at spencers), and we turned off the lights and the tv and stared at it, and watched the colors change with the music. To this day, i wonder if the colors of the flower actually change with the music. I was extremely intrigued at the flower, and began to have mild hallucinations. ", "  I thought the flower was a mailbox and was delivering this beautiful music and visualizations to us, and when i explained it to the rest of the friends, they seemed to agree. I was getting really freaked out because of the similarity of the music to the flower and decided to go outside and look at the sky. After i went out, i heard people saying 'what's wrong with greg? he wanted to hear zeppelin and now he's gone.' Outside i started to freak out. I looked at the sky, and saw a church in the distance which was not a hallucination. Hmm...the mailbox, the church? A similarity? It was too weird. Until i realized the night sky which the church inhabited. Near the church in the sky, was a pink cloud being colored by the sun, near what looked like the west--and there was a black cloud in what looked like the east.", "  This is where i had my revelation...i envisioned that the east was hell, being the direction of the coke dealer where my friends had gotten into lately, and the west was heaven where my girlfriend the angel was at. I could not stop looking at the clouds and thinking of metaphors to describe it. When i went inside to tell everyone what i was thinking about...it was at the part of the cd, where it says 'there's a feeling i get, when i look to the west, and my spirit is crying for leaving.' It was all too eerie for me to deal with and i began really getting freaked out. The west, with my girlfriend, where i want to be (like in the song), and the east where i don't want to be, with the coke....it was interesting.", "  This was all peaking in my trip for about two hours so i decided i should go to sleep and wake up in the morning and everything would be better. this is where the psychic moments happened. the apartment where i was earlier, across the complex had some people on the porch which i could see through my shut window. but not only could i see them, i could actually hear them. They were all, 'what is wrong with greg? is he ok? he was being weird and deep.' this all freaked me out even more so i began to wish that my friend melissa would be at my side, and i thought that if i thought of her enough she would appear in my doorway. as i thought and concentrated all my energy on her being there, i could feel her materialize in my pillow, her head, her mid-section, and her legs. It was almost as if she was there beside me, but at that moment, when she was almost fully complete in my bedsheets, the door opened and it was her. I started crying. It was unbelievable, and for the rest of the night we sat up talking about how weird LSD was, and how it takes you to a place that makes you understand consciousness. ", "  This may seem really far-fetched and unbelieveable, but it is %100 true.", "I took acid on a friend's recommendation. I first took ecstasy with him, which was fun so I thought that I would trust him with LSD. I took 2 dots which are apparently quite strong. After about an hour, objects began moving and things seemed to take on great symbolic value. Although the room was utterly silent apart from the music, I remember thinking that we were all still communicating on an incredible level and having each other's thoughts. Soon though we went on a walk and BLAM, the trip went bad. This was after about 2 hours. Everyone was scheming against me; my parents were about to arrive and get mad, the house was full of slugs, time had stopped and I would be like this forever; worst of all, I had no control over my chain of consciousness or thoughts.", "Eventually I got out of the house and I have been having awful flashbacks since. These often come as I am trying to sleep and I have been having nightmares for about 2months now. I feel that the acid has changed my personality also; I cannot get away from the feeling that everyone is plotting against me. Before taking LSD, I think I was friendly and outgoing. Now, though, I have become introverted and neurotic. I find it difficult to meet people (unless I am on ecstasy) and as I have just started at University, this is very bad for my social life.", "I do not know what I did wrong; I can just suggest that you think hard about the setting before you take acid. I wish I knew suggestions about controlling the flashbacks or nightmares.", "i woke up at 6:40 am on a friday and promptly ate three blue blotter. at approximately 7:25 i was walking to a coffee shop in my home town when i began to notice how exceptionally speedy this dose was. i have tripped several times and never before or again have i had such a strong amphetamine feel. ", "i went to my high school and started band at 7:50. a pleasant body buzz came over me about half way through the period as i was marching outside, and everything gained a very ironic feel. several people asked my why i was wearing sunglasses, but that was the least of my concerns. i noticed that a member of the band's head was a flag, and i began to wonder what was going on until i realized that i was on drugs. this puzzled me. ", "at 8:40 i left the high school in a friend's car (he was driving) and remarked at how incredibly beautiful the fall leaves on all the trees were, and how amazing it was that my legs were at rest, yet we were obviously moving. i then went home and called a friend, asking him to meet me at the library while admiring my insanely dilated pupils. i went upstairs to my computer and wrote the following:", "'I have saucereyes shining back at me from every reflective surface. ", "my mind is filled with a dim green golw of benevolence, washing forward and backward through my suddenly open consciousness.", "waking.  Everything is moving quickly with that speedy shimmery trainride feel, sweeping and lifting me, funnelling through a spiral of forgotten thoughts and fragments, transcending this state of smiling idiosynchrisies and uncoordinated floating chaos. In this sea of collisions and orderly creation and destruction I have made my home beyond words. This is bliss.", "screams and quieted notions greet me from the seas and mists of forgotten lores and empty passages unbeknownst to me now. Sssstirring from the cabin of this vessel has infringed upon my trainride awareness.", "Someone has lost this place.  Laughing and bursting and climbing through the walls and opening their lives back and forth in a cycle quick and precise,  we're all running back and forth through the fire searching for order in frantic wide-eyed notions of mobility and so we break down into pieces.", "Incoherent warblings and buzzing eminate from the semiconscious subconscious subhuman followers of an outdated order of life. This is a cycle of things. A feeling of familiarity. family. liars.", "And a bright white climax of fire and emotion, a shower of lights, a dawn of perception, an awakening, and then it passes back into this disconnected bunch of insanity. It's funny that i'm prompting this schizophrenia in my own mind and looking to it for so much support. irony. blindness. We hide from ourselves we run and run and hide from ourselves. ", "the words on this page have gained a sentience.  I'm going to go soon.'", "After having written that, i went to pick up my paycheck. It was close to ten o'clock, and i was peaking.  It should be noted that at nine o'clock I experienced a psychological peak, which plateaued for about two hours. At about ten I experienced a body peak, and around ten thirty  I experienced a visual peak. This was highly unusual.", "After a lengthy conversation with my employer, i went to the local bank to cash my paycheck. While waiting in line, I noticed a large mirror on the wall and admired the reflection of a young lady in it. At that point i had some confusion over my identity, and whether i was in fact me, or the girl in the reflection. I thought to myself, 'what's going on here? is this some kind of plot? good god man, get a hold of yourself!'", "I nonchalantly reached down and put my sunglasses back on, and pondered the idea of using lsd as a supplement to everyday life.", "At about eleven, I waited at the library and noticed a fog appearing from around the corner of a nearby building. I then wrote the following in my sketchbook:", "'The calm cool mist of impending destruction has taken a centre stage in today's glorius activities.", "there are a lot of crazy things going on here. i wonder whose plot this is.", "ten city blocks from ground zero and the world goes crazy.", "By eleven thirty I had met up with two friends and made my way to the city park along with two bottles of orange juice purchased in a nearby carry out. We were contemplating the nature of our hometown, seeming like a post-industrial wasteland in the middle of a life-sucking suburban community. When we reached the swing set, I downed a bottle of orange juice and decided it would be an appropriate time to contemplate the many questions i had set aside to ask myself during this trip, all relating back to the nature of a closer connection between my subconscious and conscious mind.", "I looked down at my obscenely long hair, the fallen leaves, trees like veins in the empty skies, and the people I surrounded myself with and felt an immense security. The beauty of the breathing ground and ancient collective consciousness of the nature around me infringed upon my perception in a sensory onslaught, leaving me immersed in a million thoughts moving too quickly for my brain to grasp. ", "Being overly satisfied with this situation, my friends and I departed, walking downtown to see that the trees had all been cut down months before, and the pavement ripped from the earth, leaving gaping holes and dust in the air (the fog of impending destruction). We picked up a hammer on the way, thinking of it as a valuable companion and tool in the journeys that lay ahead of us. Soon afterward, things became far less surreal. I was beginning to come down.", "My two friends and i walked to the local dairy queen in search of food, and we left the hammer outside.  After we ordered, we went and sat down, and one of the dairy queen employees went outside and picked up the hammer. A few minutes later, he brought us our food and began to walk away when I stopped him.", "'hey,' i said, 'just what the hell do you think you're doing? did you steal my friend's hammer?'", "'uhmmm... yeah, it's in the back... i'll... uh, go-'", "'Oh, that won't be neccessary. you can have it. just take good care of it. i'm sure you'll take it to where it belongs.'", "I quickly noticed that my body had no intention of eating this ice cream. whenever i put my body on autopilot, trusting it to continue consuming the ice cream, it would stop, holding the ice cream in front of me. Finally, I coaxed myself into finishing it.", "At that point i went home and listened to a lovely album by a perfect circle on my still relatively new stereo system. It was incredible. the third track has a distorted bow bassline that made me feel very light, and like i was riding some sort of twisted roller coaster, bounding from side to side. I often wonder what effects of lsd are psychosomatic, because the nature of the drug lends itself to giving you complete control of the trip with a little practice. ", "It should also be noted that the body buzz associated with lsd is a 'light' one. Alchohol and marijuana are slightly heavier than one's own body weight, dextromethorphan is like having a house on top of you, and lsd and mdma are like floating. ", "At around 5 o'clock, there was a marching band practice for the football game at 7:30 that evening. a friend of mine informed me that my pupils were still noticably dilated. This particular football game was band senior parent's night, and being that I was a senior, I got to walk down the fifty yard line escorted by my parents.  I informed them that i was feeling just fine. They never suspected a thing.", "One final note is that the next day i had the worst amphetamine comedown i have ever experienced. The whole day before i had felt speedy, but saturday morning i worked for six hours, and it sucked. a lot. One rule I think most people should follow and that i almost never break is to set aside a day after tripping to recap your days activites and to recover from excessive walking/moving.", "I've been telling this story for awhile now. I think i want to write it down too.", "It was a hot Friday night in July, and my friend Victor had a connection for good acid. I had tripped more than four times prior to this, and Victor and our other friends were fairly experienced as well. It was me, Victor, and a third friend, Benny, with 11 sugarcubes of acid in front of us. This was the beginning of a night that was amazing and yet very unnerving.", "I recommend using far more caution with large amounts of unknown-potency acid than we did. Yet it was one of the most profound, life-altering experiences i've ever had.", "At about 8.30pm or so we ate our cubes. I ate 3. Benny ate 2. Victor ate four (victor, please note, was also on anti-depressants at the time of this trip. zoloft, i think). We decided to go to a friend's graduation party. We picked up Victor's girlfriend and another female acquaintance and headed out. ", "At T+30 min. Benny ate another sugarcube. I, on the other hand, was already feeling effects of the acid. Whoever dripped these cubes must have had no idea what they were doing, becuase these things had to have been soaked. Anyway, i was driving, which was stupid to begin with, so i had to pull over and let Victor's girlfriend drive. When we arrived at the party it felt neat to get up and walk around. I looked over the fence and some hedges and saw a huge property with an olympic swimming pool and horses. 'Look at the horses', i said to everyone. wow. When i entered the yard, it was nothing more than an inground pool surrounded by concrete:) and this after not even an hour! The party, unfortunately, was terrible. There were parents there and a terrible band was playing dave matthews songs and old friends from high school whom i didn't want to see were there. i was 20 and my friends were in their mid teens. It was terrible. ", "i stumbled back to the car and waited for the others. When everyone came out of the party i demanded that Victor's girlfriend (Donna) drive us back to Victor's place. I proceeded to crawl into the passengers seat and lock my seatbelt. That party had scared me, and i was very small and afraid. As everyone piled into the car it was so hot that i rolled down the window and leaned out babbling 'we have to go, we have to go'. So Donna puts the car in reverse, and instead of backing out, slams on the gas and plows into a huge bush, which smacks me in the face. I cannot describe the terror i felt. I began to cry. i was so lost and afraid. I balled while Benny and Victor laughed and Donna apologized. Later on, in the car, Victor was describing how as a child he couldn't pronounce the letter R. I immediately began to laugh hysterically, completely coming out of the hole i was in. We decided that the other girl, Kim, would stay with us for the duration of the trip. We had no idea what we were getting into.", "When we arrived at Victor's house i sat on his back porch. Spotlights were shining down from the sky and i could see monsters and spirits in the leaves in the trees. I was still afraid. When i entered the house the tiles in the foyer shifted and gave way beneathe me. I did not regain my composure until i was upstairs on the couch, Mark Farina on the stereo. This is where the most amazing experience began for me, a complete 180 from what had just occured. ", "Kim was laying on the floor, and as i stared at her (she was very attractive, young with incredible breasts) she morphed into a little girl sitting in her room, who shifted into a black girl with an afro listening to a record player. The entire room around her shifted right along with her through different time periods. She had an incredibly tight shirt on and it had a picture of a ninja turtle on it. Victor and i laughed for at least twenty minutes, because the turle seemed to bulge and dance on her shirt. 'God i love being a turtle!' we screamed:) I stood in a corner of the room, and found that by pressing down with my foot i could bend the room. I made dust levitate with my hands and spun it around in mid-air. I lay down on the floor, and i found myself instead lying on a creek bed, looking up through the water at the sky. There were clouds and blue sky and a bright sun, no ceiling at all. I could see reeds jutting out from the river bank. Fish swam by. Kim threw her leg over the edge of a chair to my right, and the chair morphed into a long wooden dock, with kim dangling her legs down into the water. I felt so cool and relaxed. i felt at peace there underwater. i could breathe normally and watch everything without the least bit of fear. i began to play with kim's feet, rubbing and massaging them. I began to see planets orbiting around her toes, tiny meteors and stars and her feet became the universe and i got closer and closer and closer.", "I began to feel as though i needed to be alone. so after convincing everyone that it was fine i went out onto the second floor porch. I looked over the railing and saw a hole dug into the garden below, a body in a sack curled up next to it. At first i was afraid, but then i realized what was going on. That was my old self, my old body before this amazing trip. I had reached a new level of awareness and this old self was being cast back to the earth. it was a very beautiful moment for me. I watched the body enter the grave and plants grew up over it. A river appeared before me and i washed my hands in the river. AS i had experienced this, a shaft of light had flashed in the sky repeatedly. I am not religious, but i reached an inner peace with part of myself because of that vision.", "After retreating to the computer room and chatting online for a bit, i found a pen and began to write. i was still touched by my experiences outside, and i began to write 'thank you' all over the desk with a purple marker. Soon i could see tiny fuzz balls spinning on a grid inside the ink, and i flew down close and close as the ink swirled and formed patterns. I cut up a board game, producing a piece of cardboard that read 'the original memory game'. Kim came to visit me and after flirting with her for a bit we went back to join the other two. I hung my sign on the wall, where it remains to this day. Victor and Kim went off and Benny was watching Fantasia, so i sat down on the floor with Benny and we started to analyze the film. I have never seen anything more amazing than 'fantasia'. Never. 'A night on bald mountain' blew my mind. Benny and i bonded and began to get philosophical.", "I should mention at this point that time had no meaning. I know the experience began about 9pm and only truly ended at 2pm the next day. We were lost in a globe out in space, our experience was completely detached from human convention. I really believe that now. ", "It was then that we learned from Kim that Victor had taken a fifth sugarcube (remember that extra one?)while we were outside smoking. Its amazing how little impact that had on us. we figured that he was having as good a time as us. Benny went into Victor's room with Kim while i squeezed myself behind a chair and began to fantasize as 'some things come from nothing' began to play. The music that entire night became a perfect soundtrack, following our moods to the letter. It is a beautiful song and i saw tiny people on the tops of the chair throwing things down to me on the floor. Benny came out and laughed, then changed the cd to medeski martin and wood (combustication). ", "Victor emerged from the room and sat down with a cig while we bugged him about taking the last cube. He was acting weird. Apparently he had been in his room with the light off, headphones on, and the door shut. He had been trying to hook up with Kim as well. He would only say 'oh'. we couldn't get him to say anything but 'oh'.", "yes, this is where it got bad. Benny began flipping out, demanding that we tell him in detail what had happened during the night. I was completely cool by contrast, saying everything was fine. I didn't trust Kim. I was convinced she had taken some acid. I was fucked up but had convinced myself i was rationale. I told kim to take benny out of the room to talk. Meanwhile, Victor had curled up at my feet (i was sitting) and was stroking himself through his pants, chanting 'oh' in rhythmic patterns. i couldn't help but laugh. it was repulsive yet so brutally stupid that i had to laugh. Then the worst thing happened. Victor raised his head and plunged his hand into his mouth up to his wrist. i pulled it out quickly, but to this day i still don't know if that really happened. he says he was trying to kill himself because he thought he was insane.", "Victor had a true bad trip. We had to call his brother, who arrived and brought us all down to his house five minutes away. We watched 'the big lebowski' and gradually Victor came back to us. He grabbed my leg and said 'douglas is that you? are you really there, right now?' i assured him that i was and he laughed out of sheer relief. we stayed  for a little longer and then made our way back to Victor's house to collapse from fatigue. At 12.30pm saturday i awoke and went home still in a daze. I went back to sleep.", "There are two things i will say about this experience. ", "1/ BE RESPONSIBLE!!! despite my good times, alot of bad shit happened. best to be prepared. Have a COMPETENT sober aid if the trip is a big one. Have an emergency plan, like someone you can call (luckily we did). and above all PLACE YOURSELF IN SAFE, COMFORTABLE SURROUUNDINGS. also....if you are taking an unknown amount of acid, try a small does first or ask around about the hit you got. I have never had sugar cubes as completely potent and saturated with LSD as those. I had tripped at least four times prior to this experience. had i known better i might not have taken all three at once.", "2/EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE ON SUCH A HUGE TRIP AT LEAST ONCE. with the right environment and support you can completely expose your soul and rearrange your life in a positive and real way. i became much more sure of myself and socialable than i had been. many of my burdens from the past were lifted from my shoulders and thrown away.", "While i was tripping on that back porch i had believed that i would never come down and that i had reached a new and permanent level of conciousness that would stay with me forever. Sometimes i really do believe that is true.", "My girlfriend and I elected to have our own little New Years 2K party by tripping our brains out in a nearby hotel. We succeeded, using a total of six hits of acid, splitting them between us. ", "I had tripped a few times, but all at lower dosages (one or two hits), so was pretty prepared for an interesting experience. We downed one hit, with 1000mg of Vitamin C (I still don't know if it more greatly potentiates an experience, but it seemed to help.), waited one hour, and then downed hit #2, with another 1000mg of Vit. C. During this time, we had turned off all the lights in the room, lit a number of candles (most in hurricane glass - highly recommended) and relaxed.", "About an hour later, we were feeling the first two hits, VERY speedy, but OK.. and elected to imbibe the third hit, too. This particular batch of LSD-25 seemed to hit after about two hours, peak after about 4, and fade around 9 hours.", "We were already having very trippy psycholitic [sic] reactions (breathing ceiling, weird stucco, 3-D effects from the wallpaper edging, aural distortions from the Enigma and Deep Forest we were listening to), and proceeded to have delightful but not overly ecstatic sex. :) ", "Time passed, first watching VERY awful but amusing porn on the hotel Spanktrovision, then with her painting watercolors and me waxing philosophically. The third hit was coming along well, and, after she showered, I was feeling frisky, so we had sex again.", "Oh my god. :) We had complete ego dissolution, and the best sex I've ever had. I came five times, something I hadn't expected was even physiologically possible. She was getting fantastic synesthesia, seeing splashes of color with every touch and caress, while I was in the midst of watching our loveplay sort of in slow motion, floating between being in my body, and loving her, and climaxing, and floating back out of myself while we continued to make love very swiftly and ecstatically.", "There was a lot of teeth clenching and a fair amount of paranoia (on my part), but the latter is normal for me with more than one hit. Teeth clenching seemed most treatable using 'Mixed Fruit MENTOS' -- but they taste awful. 'You think you want one, and you put the Mentos in your mouth, but by then, the Mentos has used you for its' purposes.' But they crunch well. I had massive synesthesia on one, with sounds happening, instead of tasting the Mentos 'goodness'. (yecch) ", "Star Trek: The Next Generation 'The Best of Both Worlds' was on, and I mused how cheesy the Borg costumes were -- but still kind of spooky. I mused 'That must be when they know to stop spending money on effects. 'Don't spend more, sir -- it's good enough to fool the acidheads.'' ", "There were some setting issues, due to a recent death in her family, but I was feeling very empathic, and we talked, and cried, and it was a very wonderful, bonding, and flat out fun experience. Sleep was VERY hard to obtain, even 17 hours after the first hit, but it finally came. ", "Now if only LSD weren't so hard to come by here lately :)", "I was at a rave with a few friends and we all decided to buy some felix blotter acid. I dropped both hits around 1:15am. I had a great body high. I had an amazing amount of energy and i couldn't sit still. At this point, i wasn't hallucinating yet. I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off. I couldn't stop dancing, i had to keep moving. The dj was spinnin' a creepy trance track that made me think psychotic. I was nobody's friend, not even my own, but i was still moving. I didn't want anyone to touch me. It seemed as though everyone was against me and nobody cared. I didn't understand the whole scene, questions like...Why do i do this to myself? Why do people enjoy LSD? Why would anyone like to not be able to tell the difference between a dream and reality?", "That's when i stopped myself and tried to figure out who i was, why i'm here, what did i take and things like that...but i just didn't know. Right there everything hit me. The bad trip started to take over. I felt as though i couldn't control myself, but i just kept moving. After thinking like that for about 45 minutes and dancing, i sat down next to a huge brick wall. I lit up a cigarette and looked at the wall. The bricks were spelling words out, like Death, End, Over, and i closed my eyes, shook my head, looked at the wall again and there were 6 bears dancing in a cirle with sharp teeth just grinning at me, and then i realized how fucked up i was. I jumped up and ran over to a fence and grabbed onto it and just stood there. That fence seemed to bring me to reality, like when i was holding that fence, nothing could hurt me. It was like that fence was sobriety and reality - it was really there, it was the only thing that i knew was real. I looked around and everyone looked like crazy fools running around. It seemed like a riot. Through my eyes, it was total chaos, but it was really a bunch of people just enjoying themselves at a party. I was horrified when people would try to talk to me. Their skin would look disgusting, their voices would give me chills. Then the psychotic thoughts came back. I was thinking to myself, maybe all these people are in a cult and this is a gathering. Maybe they just advertised this gathering as a party to get people to come here and get all fucked up and then eat their brains or some shit. I would look around and everyone seemed to be watching me. I couldn't handle it, i had to leave. I stood up, lit a cigarette and started walking. I stared at the ground while i was walking. The grass looked like a bunch of pins waiting to prick me. It was a horrible night and i still don't remember everything or what happend after i stood up. I don't remember where i went or who with, but i guess that's something you should expect when you take a psychoactive drug like LSD. So, if you're gonna trip, know what you're in for and be careful.", "I have tripped about 9 times total in my life, and have also combined LSD with ecstasy, marijuana, and amphetamines at various times. I have found that LSD can be a misleading and deceptive drug to some extent, and I believe that accurate reports relating to the clinical effects of LSD should be read by the possible user before dosing.", "My first trip took place over a whole day. Me and 3 other close friends, two of which had taken LSD before, dropped our acid at about 9:00 in the morning and set off for a trip to the beach. I could not feel the acid kick in until about one and a half hours after we had dropped it. I went swimming while waiting for the acid to hit, and it was a fairly exhilarating experience. In retrospect, it was also incredibly dangerous.", "That first trip left little side effects (so it appeared) and I did not feel changed or altered to a noticeable level.", "After taking progressively larger doses of LSD (up to 2 T's) brain alteration became significant.", "At a rave (dance party) I dropped 2 tabs of the strongest acid I have ever touched, and this completely changed my life. The LSD was obviously in control of both my body & my mind, and this was quite a disconcerting experience. I can remember talking to people I did not know, and being looked at with mystified looks because they could not understand my unraveled chain of thought. The loud techno seemed to work its way into my head, and took control of my soul.", "I started dancing after the second tab of acid hit me, and I was actually quite scared by the realization that a man-made chemical could be so in control of my entire existence. I can still remember the rush as I melted and merged with the music, as I danced harder and harder in an attempt to work off the endless reserves of energy I seemed to possess. While I was dancing, a girl I did not know walked up to me and calmly stated, 'I believe you have lost this', and handed me a small piece of paper. On this piece of paper was printed, in capital letters 'THE PLOT'. This freaked me out so badly that I could feel my brain and inner consciousness balancing on the brink of insanity.", "The next day the post acid depression was so acute it was close to an acutely tiring head pain, and I was physically sick from my experience. I did not take acid for close to twelve months after this trip, and have only tripped once since then. I am not going to take LSD any more simply because my body can no longer handle it without suffering horrible after effects.", "This one is a real kicker, and I'm not sure where to start, so I'll start from the beginning.", "Every year, Cleveland, Ohio holds a St. Patricks day parade through the streets.  Two friends of mine  take this opportunity to drive to Cleveland (2 hours) and drop acid.  The reason for this is that everyone in Cleveland is drunk in the streets on St. Patricks Day, and we can act goofy and messed up and it's not that unusual.  This year, I decided to join them.", "I'm not a heavy drug user, but I tend to experiment with a great variety of substances.  I've done weed on many occasions, nitrous on even more occasions, PCP once by accident, Salvia four or five times with wonderful effects, abused prescription pills by eating, snorting, or smoking them, drank a couple times (dont like it), huffed ether and glade once each, and taken morning glory seeds once (EXTREME POISON).  ", "A couple days before the trip, we all went to a friends house to aquire the lsd.  This went off without a hitch, and we each bought one geltab.  The day of the trip, I woke up at 8:45, and had a light breakfast of coffee and doughnuts.  I was anticipating a wild and fun day, so I was in a really good mood.  I then got in my car and picked up my friends.", "I decided to take dose as soon as we left.  This was about 10:15.  Being my first time, I decided to take only half the acid at first.  I let it dissolve under my tongue, and then went on with the car ride as usual.", "After 45 minutes had passed, I noticed a slight effect.  Sort of like when I've been awake a long long time and my thinking all funny, but without the sleepiness and other bad effects.  After an hour, we were half way there, and I was definatly tripping.  It was nothing like I had imagined.  I thought of tripping as like being on weed, but with hallucinations.  This is wrong.  When I smoke a lot of weed, I get paranoid and scared.  Not with acid.  The feeling is so incredibly strange, It's really a bizzar high.  At this point, I decided to take the other half of the dose.  We stopped at the McDonalds drive through, and all got O.J.  But it wasnt just oj, it was O  J !!!  I felt so good, I couldnt wipe the smile off my face.  Acid is not scary (but I see how it could be in the wrong situation) its a beautiful, strange feeling.", "After arriving at cleveland, we decided to go to the flats.  This is an area with lots of bars and night clubs and craziness.  By this time, I was peaking.  Everything looked so strange, and all my sences were distorted.  We stopped half way there, in the lobby of some law offices to warm up.  The brick wall was made so that the borders of the bricks were uneven, some were square, some pentagons, ect.  I stared at the spot where the bricks met the carpet, and lo and behold, the bricks were moving, and sinking down, pulling the carpet along with them.  ", "When we got to the flats, we pretty much wandered around the streets for several hours.  It was great.  Colors seemed brighter, patterns on walls moved.  The greatest thing about acid, was that the hallucinations were an extention of my mind.  If I concentrate on somthing moving, you can get it to look like its moving!  It's kind of like living in a dream world, where anything can happen.  Everything around me was strange and unfamiliar.  Acid is definatly nothing like I thought it would be.  It's very bizzar, and strange.", "That night, I couldnt sleep until 2:00 AM.  I was still feeling funny at this time.  The next day, I still felt funny, but it was managable.  It's been about a week, and I have noticed that the acid has changed me.  My perception of the world is different.  Colors look better, music is more intreuging, and I generally am in a better moodI'm so happy I did it, it's really an experience to think about.  The only word of caution I have is make sure you have ALL DAY AND NIGHT to do nothing but trip and recover.  Personally, I wouldnt want to deal with authority figures even for a good 8 hours after it wears off, it lingered for a LONG time.  Well, thats my experience, so be careful, and have fun!!", "This happened awhile ago, I'd say in about the summer of 1998 or so. I was 22 and I'd just moved in with my boyfriend (now my husband), and his psycho little brother had moved out. So I was very relieved and happy (that the psycho was out of my immediate life). Our apartment was a crapheap, a former crackhouse, and they were remodeling it and the rest of the building for the entire year we lived there. But it was Sunday, and the workers claimed they'd have the day off. So me and my man took two hits of acid each.", "I was feeling great when it started. I was happy and looking forward to painting, drawing, talking...just hanging out. For some reason I strongly needed to get naked as I was born. My husband started making out with me, then there was a knock on the door. The construction crew had been called in to work on the plumbing and to install our new sink. We of course told them it was a very bad time, so they set to work on the apartment directly below ours. I hid in the bedroom closet with the cat in my arms, scared out of my mind. My was heart was racing and I was afraid of being found out, and everything that may have gone with that. Arrest, parental disapproval, being abandoned by a severely judgmental friend. Basically, the trip was sent on a permanent negative course. And it lasted at least 12 hours. We ended the night by seeing an Aphex Twin concert and those giant bears really freaked my shit out.", "All day I could hear the pipes being banged and I could never tell if the men were in our apartment or not. We actually checked the bathroom several times. I could hear everything all at once, and I couldn't tell where any sounds were coming from. People outside may have well been standing right next to me and whispering in my ear for all I knew. After awhile we went into the front room to listen to music. I believe it was Beck. He sounded so real. Like I could feel him. I don't know how to explain it. It's like I decided I knew exactly who he was just by the sound of his voice, and I dubbed him one of the few genuine good people on the planet. I watched the wood grain of the floor dance in sync with the music, and was quite amused for awhile, then I was horrified. We shut off the music and just lay on a futon by the window, watching the swaying branches of a huge tree outside.", "I heard a woman yell at her kids, I heard a slap, screeching tires, swearing...Everything all at once and from everywhere again, but this time I all I heard was misery, evil, and pain. But when I looked outside I saw the beauty of the clear blue sky and the vivid life of the tree. The contrast between the evil of us and the beauty of nature seemed wrong and sick, and then I started crying for all of the idiots that make themselves and others miserable on purpose. I decided it was on purpose. There was no need for this diseased society after all. After my crying jag I followed my husband into our bedroom. I curled into a fetal position on the bed and starting whining, 'Make it stop. Make it stop.' Over and over. I held my hands over my ears but I could still hear everything. The cat jumped up with me and lay right against me purring as I sobbed uncontrollably for at least fifteen minutes straight. Then I looked at her face. It seemed concerned and confused. This somehow struck me as hilarious. I then proceeded to laugh hysterically and loudly for twenty minutes straight. Then the cat became frightened and ran off. This spun me back around to sobbing.", "After awhile my husband decided he needed to have sex with me, I didn't really want to, but I just let him. It was horrible. I felt bent to suit someone else. Like I was being bent to unnatural shapes, like putty. I felt invaded, like a deflating balloon, like I was shrinking inside of myself, and being turned inside out. Like my muscles were shrinking and shrinking. Like I would sink into the mattress and drown in its fabric. I kind of wanted to. Then I heard footsteps. I paid them no attention, because I'd lost all ability to discern where a sound was emanating from. But I'm sure the front door opened, and I heard a man yell back up to someone. I heard laughter, and him amusedly inform someone, 'They're out of it.' Then the door closed. When It was over my husband was very clingy and apparently had a completely different experience from me. Later he said it was beautiful, close, almost ephemeral. He really doesn't like hearing my side of it.", "I was starting to feel myself again. But I was still far gone. We for some reason we closed ourselves up in his brother's former room. I think because there was nothing in it really. The least stimulus available seemed the best amount. I leaned against the window. Suddenly I was afraid of falling through. I thought I was very fat, but I wasn't. Then I saw a drug dealer and I wanted to fall out and on him. It seemed funny somehow. I actually had to exert mental will and pressure on myself to not do it. I forced myself to the floor and away from the temptation.", "Then we just stared at each other. We never said anything, or we did but didn't realize we were, and we had a conversation. We were convinced we were on a telepathic vibe. Finally it was subsiding to something very faint, and that's when we went out to the Aphex Twin concert. Afterwards some guy was talking to my husband. He congratulated him on having acquired 'someone like her.' And I was very confused. Mostly because I'm filled with quite of a bit of self-loathing. Which I now know, means I shouldn't do acid.", "Well, this experience wasn't the first time I'd experimented with psychedelic drugs by any means. In fact, the weekend before this particular Saturday, I had eaten a tab on Friday and a tab on Sunday. I had gotten the acid that weekend from someone I ran into completely through random dumb luck, and on the spur of the moment I bought 10 hits. I have very different standards of self-control than most people and that actually made Tom, my sidekick and friend, very nervous about my mental/physical health. He was opposed to doing the LSD and told me that on Friday.", "When I woke up on Saturday I was expecting a fairly boring day. Tom had slept on my floor and at 11:30am when I finally woke up and kicked him awake, we set out for coffee. Over coffee and cigarettes we decided that we wouldn't do the acid, we'd save it for later when we'd appreciate it more. He had tripped with me last Friday (not Sunday tho, that was all by myself) and thought it better to wait. Besides, we had plans to go see a few bands in downtown Boston that day at 9pm and we could easily kill 8 hours with grass. ", "When we got back to my house, however, we found we had a situation on our hands. I still live at home at the age of 19 (taking computer programming classes - my brain isn't rotted quite yet) and I'm pretty absent-minded, and this time I had forgotten my keys. Worse yet, no one was home and we were locked out. So of course, we ended up eating a tab of acid and heading out into the huge park across the street from my house.", "We wandered around the park for a while with nothing exciting to report. We smoked a joint and waited and walked. We left the park and headed for the huge graveyard which is also pretty much right next to my house. At this point, the acid was having subtle effects on me. The grass of the graveyard was greener, the sky was bluer, the sun was brighter. This is something that usually happens to me under psychedelics at first and I was used to it. I was also not too taken aback when we passed three or four signs that said 'WATER' very strangely, or so it seemed. The letters were white, on a green background. The font that was used for the sign seemed to have millions of imperfections that I was only then able to pick up because of the drug. The sign seemed to stand out to me, as if WATER was something I should remember and think about. ", "As if reading my mind, Tom suggested we go buy something to drink from the store. 'Why not?' I thought. At this point the LSD wasn't doing very much and I figured that this was a good time to test myself in public. I asked Tom if he was tripping yet, because it had been over an hour now. He wasn't really. Right about then, Tom suggested we eat another tab. I had to agree with him. We decided tripping was worth doing, so it must be done right. We went back to my house (my parents had gotten home), ate the tab, and headed off to the store.", "We decided to smoke another bowl to set us off. We headed towards the baseball diamond, past it, and into a part of the park where people tend not to go, through a hole in a fence, and we were on a high cliff overlooking an authentic train yard. We smoked a bowl and walked along the cliff, and nothing was happening. We left the fence and I got my first real hit from the acid. We were standing on a hill next to the fence overlooking the baseball field and suddenly the green grass and the brown dirt of the baseball field all seemed to be bleeding into each other. The baseball diamond had grass seeping onto it and the sand from the baseball diamond was mingling with the outer reaches of the grass. The metal backstop was gleaming and glittering and hard to focus on. ", "I looked at Tom. That was a horrible idea. One of the oddest things about my trip was that during the entire time, whenever I looked at my companion, I would see his face in about 10 different perspectives all flashing and changing very rapidly. I had to strain to figure out what kind of looks he was giving me. It was very odd. I'm used to looking at people and seeing strange things when under the effects of drugs, but this time it was just a bit too real. I couldn't see people for what they were during the trip. Children passing me by or playing in the playground all resembled aliens from some Spielberg movie. Most of the adults I dealt with that day looked normal, but they had an aura of evil around them that only I seemed able to grasp.", "Had I done too much? How could I really be sure? Four tabs in under two weeks? Was that an excess? Now, it doesn't seem like such a strange thing, but at the time, the thought was running through my head like a marathon runner. It was everywhere in my mind. When I tried to think of something else, it worked its way back into my head, like a virus. ", "The visual hallucinations had started early and I felt robbed of the laughing hysteria phase that usually overtook me. In place of that, I found myself on a rambling kick. I'd start talking and keep talking and then I'd look over at Tom and he'd be staring at me. I explained to him that my inner conversings had come out to play. He seemed to accept this answer and I was glad about that. One less thing to worry about, but Tom was worried. He was rightly worried, because less than 10 minutes later we passed a mother and a kid on a bicycle and suddenly I starting jabbering about being a kid and all my childhood memories from this very same park. After we got out of earshot, Tom made fun of me for a while about scaring the lady and the kid. I hope I didn't scare them too much. ", "About this time, the trip was coming on full power. I felt a rush all around me. The world outside of my line of perception seemed to me to be very much irrelevant, and the only thing that mattered was right there in that park. Beforehand I was worried that I would start obsessing over my personal girl problems. I soon learned that those thoughts melted away, and I couldn't have been happier.", "Time was also very distorted. Neither of us had a watch nor any way to keep track of what time it was. We had to go back to my house at some point to prepare ourselves to get on the train (we decided not to drive; multiple felons maybe, but responsible people). At what must have been 4:00, we had a huge discussion over what time it was. We were sure that it was nearly 7 and we had to go back soon to get ready for the show. We smoked a bowl and headed back to my house. Well, it turned out that it was 4:30 when we got back (meaning we smoked up at 4:20 - very cool, very cool; we can never make 4:20 unless it's accidental for some reason). After we realized it was early still, we headed back, but the entire rest of the day, time kept doing odd things to us. ", "We decided to go back to the store, because we had smoked all of our cigarettes (we went on chain-smoking mode once the trip started) and we wanted to buy some candy to eat as an experiment. I found, however, that being in the store was more then I was prepared to deal with, so I told Tom I'd be waiting outside, gave him money to buy me cigarettes, then went outside and smoked the only cigarette I had left from before. Once I was alone and outside, the world changed gears. It went from being extremely small and centered around me to being very large. I suddenly became aware of every single person who walked by me and what they were doing. Then they all seemed to be looking at me. I decided it was all in my head - all paranoid delusions. I tried to find Tom in the store window, and I succeeded. I watched him pay for the gummi worms (our testing material) and cigarettes, and noticed how he avoided looking at and talking to the clerk. I found it very amusing apparently, because I started laughing hysterically. At that point my brain reminded me I was all alone outside and I said, very loudly, 'Oh shit...', turned around, and saw some guy legitimately staring at me.", "Bad vibes overcame me, but they were soon gone. Tom got out of the store and tossed me a bag of gummi worms and a pack of cigarettes. Bliss. Usually when tripping I find eating is generally out of the question. When I think I'm hungry, I get a ton of food but then I can't eat it, or something goes horribly wrong in the process of getting food. No matter. Gummi worms aren't exactly food, more like fun, weird, strange globs of chemicals not entirely unlike the ones I had in me causing all these effects in my brain. The gummi worms were great. I puzzled over their movement, their taste and texture, and had a very long conversation about it. ", "The store is across the street from the park on the other end of the park from my house, so we went back into the park and sat at the end in an area that was circular with benches around it. In the middle of the circle was a tree with a fence around it. We each sat on our own bench and stared at the tree in the fence. Suddenly, in my brain Tom was gone. He was out of sight and out of mind. I checked my limbs for a status report but I couldn't really control them that well, so I gave up. I started to hear my heart pounding loudly and then the tree started to seemingly dance. It was skinny, small, and without leaves. It was twirling and rippling and the fence surrounding it was bobbing up and down. The rush I spoke of earlier intensified. Suddenly, there were church bells. The church bells played a strange, enchanting sound. I can't be too sure how long I sat there watching the tree and fence, listening to the church bells in my own little world. Suddenly, though, I realized Tom was sitting on the next bench over. I had actually completely forgotten about him, but I didn't want to break up what was happening. In my mind I explained it as a pure trip, that is, what was happening to me right then at that exact moment was everything that acid should have been. Of course, this was probably just the drugs speaking, but it sure felt that way. The combination of sight, sound, and taste sensations had overwhelmed me with goodness and I was lost. I wondered to myself if Tom was experiencing the same things, but he looked bored when I finally looked over at him. I made a really quick attempt at explaining it to him, but it didn't work at all.", "Anyway, eventually 8pm did come and we had to leave for the show (after smoking some more pot). At this point I was still tripping, not as hard as earlier, but the acid was taking its toll. All the people on the train seemed to be detached from me and Tom, and they also seemed to be staring at us. More paranoid delusions. I had a quote of HST's running through my head all during the train ride, trying to keep myself grounded:  'ignore this terrible drug.' Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. Everyone I looked at had big, buggly eyes and was leering at me. I had decided that they all knew there was something wrong with me. I could pass it off as being drunk tho, and that's not that bad for 8pm on a Saturday evening. ", "We got to our desired T stop at 8:30 and that left us half an hour to kill. We wandered around with no particular direction, half strung out and half still tripping. Now, Boston is not a town for psychedelic drugs by any means, but I've survived peaking in Boston so there wasn't much in the town that could throw me off, or so I thought, but instead, out of the blue, two people offered to sell Tom and me two different drugs (one was e, and the other was called 'charley,' which I think is heroin but I can't be too sure). That got me extremely paranoid and anxious about going to this club, because i have spent a lot of my life in Boston and I find it incredibly hard to find anything around here. Odd. ", "But, by the time doors opened and we got in, the acid was pretty much completely gone and the dope had worn off long ago. I had a slight headache from dehydration but I danced my ass off anyway. All in all, a fun day and a great trip, maybe the most intense I'll ever have. I got home and passed out first thing. Woke up and went to work for some overtime to pay my way through next weekend.", "It was ritual really... every weekend, Kaylie and I 'take a trip' and temporarily leave reality.  Its our thing.  Usually 2 or 3 hits... no more. Maybe its frowned upon and what not... but we do it religiously.", "Last weekend, there was some hard-core RAINBOW acid goin around.  My friend Barrett had a bought a vial.  The guy he got it from had said, 'you really don't want to take more than 3 at a time or your ass will fry.'  ", "Regardless, B. dropped 5 on my tongue, as well as Kaylie's 4. (2 pm)  At the time we were all at John's house.  He had eaten 6 directly before we did. Kaylie and I decided to go the mall and grub at Chik Filet before it kicked in and then we intended on going back to John's.  I wasn't really feeling anything like anxiety prior to eating it.  I was actually pretty casual about it and tried not to think about it so it would hit me hard when it 'snuck up on me.'", "I was hungry as hell.  It was 2:30 when we sat down to eat.  In a couple of minutes I felt alot of tightness in my jaw and my fries looked kind of... glossy?  A damn 35 minutes- it hit me hard... I wanted to hit it back.  We threw away our food, unable to eat.  I was so f***ing giddy and I was laughing uncontrollably.  Leaving the mall, Kaylie and I ran into my friend Amanda.  I gave her a hug and whispered, 'I'm tripping my balls off.'  She goes, 'yeh, I can tell. calm down.'", "I don't remember the drive back to John's house. [Erowid Note: it is extremely irresponsible to plan to drive while high.]  When we got back, there were about 9 people and everyone was on the same shit.  I felt much more comfortable then.  I laid on the floor in front of a fiber optics lamp.  Kaylie suggested we find some Ecstacy and 'candy flip.'", "B. said if I rode with him he could hook us up with some killer X.  I really didn't want to.  My mind was racing, I was skipping words in my sentences, and I was not too swift on my feet because I was visualizing piles of sunglasses all over the floor and I did not want to step on them.  For some reason I didn't think I could function unless some one else was with me, telling me what to do- so I didn't want to leave Kaylie.  All of that in addition to the fact that B is a terrible driver and sweat was rolling down his face after dropping 7 hits in his eye.", "Being a damn fool I consented.  He drove like a f***ing lunatic.  B. had to make a few stops to sell and pick up a girl.  The X fell through.  It pissed me off because I didn't want it to wear off and by then we were claiming it the 'best acid we've ever had.'  I sat waiting in the back of his jeep and convinced myself  to take more.  (6:30 pm)  He sold me 3 more hits (I took them promptly) and I got 2 more for Kaylie.  We all went back to John's and smoked out in his garage.  I was light headed, dizy, and I felt like I was watching myself.", "The most random and distorted thoughts ran through my head about myself, life, and everyone else there.  I kept slipping in and out of reality and sort of having dreams with my eyes open and I was unaware of movement and sound around me.  Barrett stumbled into the garage...'Theres a f***ing house on fire!!'  No one paid real attention to what he had said.  A couple people ran out to look.", "::I'm drawing a blank right here.::  I remember riding in the back seat of Matt's car with Evan and Kaylie.  I saw it.  I saw the house.  Masses of cop cars, firemen, and people taking pictures grew around it.  It depressed me.  I stood alone watching it.  It was sad, but we couldn't turn away from it.  I was confused... I wasn't sure it was acctually there.  My thoughts were interupted by a gas explosion.  Some one grabbed my arm and escorted me back to the car.", "From then on I could barely clear my head.  Schizophrenia took over me.  I spoke when spoken to -- which was not often.  Most everyone kept to themselves.  It was about 11.  Kaylie and I pulled ourselves away from the party.  The drive home was silent.  The road turned into a steep cartoon road with a smiley face sun.  It was a short ride home.  When we got there my uncle was there.  I didn't ask why.  Kaylie and I went upstairs and my whole body was shaking and going into mild convulsions.  Within a few minutes my uncle came upstairs.  I didn't move.  (I thought maybe he wouldn't see me.)  I couldn't look him in the eye.  He began talking about something... I don't know.  I saw him speak... but my thoughts drowned out his voice.  He left.  The rest of the night was a blur.  ", "The next morning I was confused and scared.  I wasn't sure if the fire had acctually happened.  Kaylie told me that I scared the hell out of her and I was rambling about waffles and cops.  ", "I don't know exactly what triggered my 'bad trip'.  Take it for what its worth.  I will probably not trip again, and if so it will be a long time.  And everyday I'm reminded of it when I drive by the burnt-down house.", "This is the story of my latest trip, which occured tonight and continues as I write this. I am 16 years old.", "I went to a friend's house this evening at about five o'clock. There, I dropped three hits of white blotter that remained from 20 I'd bought a few weeks before. I went with two of my friends to a restaurant, where I drank water and had nothing to eat.", "At around 6:30, I started getting the familiar queasiness in my stomach, but decided not to tell my friends yet. I went into the bathroom and looked at my pupils, and they were really big by this time. We wandered around a while, and they had a cigarette, before we decided to walk to our high school football game. We paid, went in, and sat down with some of my other friends. I immediately noticed the full moon, and the clouds that sometimes covered it.", "Throughout the game, I would notice the moon and its position in the sky. I talked to my friends for a while, and they still did not know I was definitely feeling the acid. I talked to one of them about the fourth dimension, and how difficult it is to comprehend something like that, even though it must exist (for reference, look up 'Flatland' and read it...insane).", "The moon, meanwhile, crawled across the sky, and it sometimes appeared as if someone had taken a huge eraser and smeared the moon's color across the black sky. By 8:30 or so, my friends knew I was tripping, because I said something about the huge dragon around the moon. We started discussing the Pillsbury Doughboy and how it would be funny if, instead of saying 'Whoo-hoo!' when you poked his stomach, he said 'Fuck you!' This conversation lasted until halftime, when the two friends I arrived with left (one has a curfew with his probation, and the other wanted to go home). I found a glowrod lying on the ground. I played with this and talked to some other people, and occasionally watched the game. The moon continued to creep and bleed across the sky, and shine its bright yellow light through the clouds.", "At around 10 o'clock, I went with a different friend to the dance, because the game had ended. I took my trusty glowrod, and took off my shoes. In the gym, I talked to many people and continued to twirl the glowrod. Its mystical green light entranced me, and my friend decided it was time to leave. I had thought we had been there about five minutes, but it was actually more like 45. We left, got in the car, and cruised around looking for a party. I was content to sit and listen to selected tracks from Tool, Sublime, and some other groups I can't recall now.", "We found a party: unfortunately, it sucked, so we left. I don't remember whether I even got out of the car or not, but we went to Wendy's and three of the five people got Frostys. We then drove back to the same party, and saw some people we knew, when some old guy told us we had to leave because we were blocking the cul-de-sac or something. Once more, we got into the car, and drove to one other place where a party was supposed to be. There was nothing there, so I was brought home at about 11:30. I talked to my mom for a while (which is always cool and scary at the same time), and then I watched some television. I had a Hotpocket and a Coke, which was the first thing I had eaten since about noon.", "I am now sitting here writing this, and I enjoyed my evening thoroughly.", "After reading on the internet and talking to people who've done it before, my girlfriend and I decided to trip for the first time.  We picked up 2 hits of blotter for free because I ran a couple errands for the kid I was supposed to buy it from.  So, we went back to her house and ate some McDonald's and ingested the paper.  About 20 minutes in, it began to feel like we got ripped off, so we smoked a bowl and began to watch 'The Green Mile.'  About 1 hour into the experience I began to feel very, very anxious about something, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  Everything seemed weird, out of the ordinary.  So, we continued to watch the movie and I caught my first visual in the part where the black prisoner coughed up the bee/wasp things.  It looked like they came right out of the TV and flew past me.  It was quite cool.  I also noticed that the color on the TV, mainly people's skin, was extremely bright, glowing even.  After that it seemed like I stopped tripping until about three hours later, when a friend came over.  He saw the size of my pupils and decided to play with my head for a little bit.  He kept lighting a lighter by his face, and it was extremely amusing.  Then he tried to make it look like he was going to kick me.  He was across the room and I swear I thought he was going to hit me right in the face.  I freaked out and started jumping around covering myself screaming!  When I realized what I was doing, I found it extremely hilarious and cracked up.  I laughed so hard that tears were streaming down my face.  After I calmed down, I got kinda hungry.  I was leaving at 10:30 and it was 9:00, so I wanted something quick and easy.  I don't remember how it happened, but somehow we ended up making spaghetti.  After I ate, my mom came and got me and I went home and just slept.  I remember I couldn't concentrate on one thought the whole night.  I felt if I did I would go insane.  I also couldn't keep my fingers out of my mouth.  ", "Overall, I wouldn't say that the experience was a waste, or a disappointment, but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  Still, really cool.  I loved it. I plan to try it again in about 2 weeks with a stronger dose.  I'll do a follow up on it.  Maybe I'll even do a comparison.", "After a long night at work and a few shots of Jaegermister my 18 year old sister came home to a house full of friends. We all had decided to talk her into tripping with us because it was going to be such a pretty day. After about an hour of coaxing she gave in and ate the cubes. ", "After about another hour or so it started to kick in. We were all sitting outside in the sun trying to see whatever we could move. I was starring at a rock and for whatever dumb reason I started moving my head back and forth to make the object seem trippy or whatever. I told my sister to try it, it was cool.", "That was the beginning of the most horrible drug induced seizure I ever witnessed. After she moved her head up and down a couple times she began to black out. None of us knew what was going on. She began to wave her hand in the air and kept saying 'woah, woah' we all thought that she was swatting at a bee since there was a nest nearby. She then fell into the side of the house and began convulsing. ", "I could hear her teeth grinding together and I will never forget the way it sounded. We all ran to see what was going on when she started shaking almost in slow motion. Her arms were stuck straight out and turned upside down. We took her into the house and sat her under the air until she became concious again. I kept asking her what her name was and she just looked at me like she didn't even see me. I was horrified and will never, ever trip again.", "I recently had a chance to find myself switching roles in an experience I had had on LSD.  I had some younger friends over, who were relatively inexperienced on LSD.  Only two others were on LSD, the other three were just drinking for various reasons.  We had acquired the LSD from a reputable source that evening in liquid form dropped onto sugar cubes.  The two novices took a double dose there and then another an hour later after returning to my house, which I like to think of as a good chill space.  I took one double dose about the time they took their second.  I set up a series of music that I knew would be enjoyable and mind bending, particularly in the acid head space (Orbital, Banco de Gaia, etc).", "The LSD was very clean and high quality.  It snuck up behind us slowly and then wacked us over the head, sucking our brains into the spirals that wouldn't stop for the rest of the evening.  When I felt mine come on, I just let myself go.  Being slightly off timing of the other two, I settled more into an observer state than trapped into their spirals (tho that would ensue later).  I found it quite humorous to see them trapped in the mindset that we (and they to each other) were 'fucking with them'.  It was funny to me because I remember one trip I had where, even being somewhat experienced on LSD, I felt like the people I was tripping with (whom I had only known through online communications) were messing with me and we were all messing with each other.  In that case as with this, it was never anything malicious or disturbing, but was well summarized in the quote 'Ok, who's fucking with me, is it you or me?'", "It just made me realize that one shouldn't always try and define or explain the acid head space.  It often leaves one confused.  I enjoyed just observing and letting myself go.  Having come to many interesting understandings in Aikido recently about spirals, shapes, energy flow, and the like, I was able to fit these same thoughts and identify with the same concepts affecting the flow of the LSD space.  The ever elusive point (singularities are a bitch, always gotta remain on the tangent), circular thought patterns, infintite spirals (they're the same whether they are spinning in or out), movement of body, mind, and energy, etc.  It was difficult to explain or put them in a rigid framework, so I just let myself experience them as they came and manifest them in whatever form may be at the time, whether it was dance, thought, manipulation of others (like I said, there wasn't neccessarily any fucking with others, often it just seemed like it, but that doesnt mean it didn't happen, cause it's fun when you get it right), or Aikido shapes/forms.  ", "It was just interesting to see the same strugglings that I have been through, evidenced in these two, and to provide the chill space where one could just deal with it. I'm not trying to sound like an elitist bastard (albeit I am one), but I take the lessons from LSD to my heart, and they do help me integrate my reality and how I interact with it.  My presence of mind is greatly aided by a dissolution of self and the reconstruction of intent and structure. It was refreshing to see where I had come from, and where my mind and self have developed since then.  Not to say it's not possible for me to get caught in the same spirals, they're always there.  It was just fun to play the observer.", "The experience was proabably one of the terrible trips of my life. I took acid thinking it would just be like weed, where I would be tripping and laughing, little did I realize that acid can take you into a different world where your not in touch with reality, nor your body and soul. Shortly after I consumed acid I was seeing the world in a new view, like another dimension. Though objects did look cool, I was in miserable hell, I felt like a lost, extrememly lonely girl who has fallen into a deep dark hole and no one was there to help me.  ", "Also while I was on acid I had a reality check, I hated all my friends and I felt like everyone was out there to get me, all my thoughts were negative and I wanted to  inflict my pain upon everyone. I was in complete paranoia and my false worries turned into reality, I was in ultimate hell and i could'nt get out. Though I did regret the experience I wish I would have done it around someone I really loved and trusted, becuase even though I had a bad trip I can see how drugs sometimes can be a beautiful thing if done right and with the right person. It can become a magical substance that can give you an experience out of this world.", "i have been visiting this site for quite some time now, as it is an extremely valuable source for info that i believe should be required to know before one ventures into the vast world of psychedelics.  Lately ive been noticing a lot of reports dealing with 'bad trips' or bad first experiences. i thought i would share my freakout story which is a pretty good one, in hopes that it can help another in understanding a similar situation.  ", "well it all started one fateful friday night when a hippy friend of mine brought over this blotter with a picture of timothy leary imprinted on it.  i thought hey cool an acid guru ill buy 10 (price was another factor in this decision as they were extremely cheap, 10 for 20)  the plan was to eat the cid the following day and head to the aquarium and look at the fish along with various other light hearted tripping activities to take place in the big city of seattle.  ", "i think i should make it clear at this point that this was the third time i had ever tripped on acid and that the first two times yielded barely a threshold experience.  a close friend of mine suggested that since it was blotter it was probably weak and so i figured id eat as much as he did. 7 hits total of the best acid that has come to this area in a while. needless to say it didnt take me long to realize how horribly i screwed up.  we started the day out by 'racing' the acid to the aquarium. (we dosed and then drove down I5 at top speed as the acid very quickly kicked in) we got to our destination and discovered that the aquarium was closed. a panic and terror i still have troubles describing to this day swept over me and everything and everyone looked how id imagine them to look if the world had just ended.  we wandered aimlessly to a park where we sat for maybe an hour maybe four i cannot say as at this time i became lost inside my head in a world where time did not exist. it was as though i were experiencing all of time from the begging and it was all leading up to what i much later have realized was the death of my ego.  at this time in my life i was very depressed and their were many wierd tensions within the group of friends i was tripping with. both of these factors played a big part in what happened next.  ", "we left the park and some how found our way to our car (i managed to cross a busy city street without the aid of a cross walk by merely timing my way through traffic, much like playing frogger) we got into the car and as we drove from the piers to the freeway both my two friends and i had what i later found out were simotanious hallucinations, our car had turned into a spaceship of somesort, upon realizing that this was happening my friend m began to puke up a dayglow orange bile that was the consistancy of gack or runny jello. i was convinced that she was an alien and that i had been somehow at the park shifted into another dimension.  we made to my friend j's moms place where i suddenly was struck by the fact that we must have all died and were now in pergatory. at this point i had said very little, infact nothing for several hours, but everyone else was in seemingly good spirits which confused me a great deal as we were all dead, and that scared me deeper than anything.  ", "i began to lose it, i thought that both my female friends were my recently made x girlfriend and tried to make out with both of them. i thought for a time i was a god of this pergatory and then that my friend r was god and he was going to kill me for trying to kiss his girlfriend. i then made my way to j's moms shower which had one of those heat lamps in it. this combined with the neo hippy hicus about cleanliness and spirituality lead me to believe that the shower was the way to heaven. of course i did not ascend and so i ran about the house naked and began to seriously freak, my friends took turns (and no offense to them but poorly so) trying to calm me down. my friend k decided it might be a good idea as he put in his not really that intelligent psychoanalytical terms, to 'help me die' of couse this only furthered my freakout and i know realized that all my friends were demons taking my life from me and that the only way to get to heaven was to simply let go of my life on earth. i did and then i lost conciousness.  at this point it was as though i was drifting between worlds, i would gain conciousness in one world where my friends j and k were pounding on my chest and opening my eyes for me in an attempt to get me to as they put it 'snap out of it' then i would fade into another where j's mom was soothing me and telling me that i had just eaten some bad acid and that i would be ok.  of course this all was happening linearly in time but at this point i had no real concept of linear time which was very cool but very strange as well. needless to say j's mom knew what was up (shes an old hippy) and she calmed me down. but it took four days for me to get my mind straight and to stop believeing my delusions. ", "the point of this story as i see it to emphasize set and setting as well caution and knowing what a drug is all about before you jump in to it.", "This experience took place early in the year 2000 in a small town in north central Florida. The night began with my attendance to a keg party consisting of a near-full keg, an apartment that I had never been to, and about 25 college aged people (about one-third of which I knew). I had already consumed about 4 or 5 beers, but I have a high tolerance for alcohol, so the effects were not overpowering. ", "Not long after I was at the party, I was engaged in a conversation with a friend-of-a-friend that I had heard of, but never actually met. We talked about music and the local drug scene for about 15 minutes or so, when he brought up the subject of acid. Not soon after, he sold me 5 tabs of paper that he said were quite potent for a cheap $10. I was suprised at the low price, but split the tabs with my close friend Eric, each of us eating 2 and a half tabs.", "We soon left the party to go to our friend Jennifer's house to listen to some new house music Jennifer had bought and to play her old, original nintendo system with classic games (tetris, etc). I rode with Eric.", "We got there and played Legend of Cage and listened to Jennifer spin her house records. I soon started feeling a bit strange, but I had tripped many times before this, and it was not anything new. I smoked a few cigarettes and kept playing nintendo, noticing that no one had said a word for quite a while (at least 10 minutes). Two new people soon came by, bringing with them burgers from Krystal's (a fast food chain). Justin, one of the newcomers, announced directly to me that he was tripping pretty hard (and wasn't particularly happy about his trip), but that he was 'always up for eating krystals.' I was familiar that the chemical composition of LSD was crystalline, and it made me a bit curious of his statement. He then repeated the statement a few more times and laughed a scary, demonic-type laugh. I had seen Justin a few times before this, but I was not his good friend, and had never seen him like this.", "Not soon after, I began to trip extremely hard, and I got a strong feeling that the people I were with, even my friends, had an evil nature to them. I concluded this based on the things they said and the looks they gave me. It seemed that whenever I would think this, whoever I was thinking of would look at me and give me an evil, knowing smile.", "I became more and more frightened of the people and situation in Jennifer's house, and I had a strong feeling that I needed to leave soon or I would start freaking out. I looked at Eric, and mentioned the idea of leaving soon. Immediately, Justin asked Eric where his keys were. It was then that I realized Eric had lost his keys, and I was stuck in this house with these people. The situation was now elevated, and I was soon so freaked that I fled the house alone without anyone noticing.", "I found myself under the street light outside. I looked up into the artificial light, wondering what I had done and what on earth I was going to do with myself. I looked back to the ground, and saw something I will never forget. There were three small black kittens circling me and meowing silently. I bent down to touch them, and they kept circling, not affected whatsoever by my petting. I began to really freak and I started running in the direction of my house, which was about 5 miles away.", "I soon found myself in the middle of a mid-high class neighborhood at about 5:30 Saturday morning. The sky was beginning to take on a reddish-pink hue, yet it still retained it's dark-blue night shade. I wondered how I had gotten there; I was supposed to be in my own neighborhood. Yet I felt like I wasn't in a neighborhood at all, but in another dimension or reality. After staring around intently at this interesting new place, I lost all previous fear and anxiety, and things began to take on an unexplainable mathematical clarity. I was not visually hallucinating, however. I was just able to look at the road, the blades of grass, the gentle breeze, and the trees, seeing them all as extremely complex mathematical equations and expressions.", "I was overwhelmed by the sensations, and I collapsed into the yard of an unknown resident. As my body hit the grass, I suddenly felt as if I had lost my mortal body and my consciousness had elevated into the afterlife.", "And then it happened. The colors and shapes of everything around me turned into giant fractals. MY history and existence was an entire world of chaos math and neverending, intelligent fractals, expanding and developing into infinity. My mind was at a peace I can never describe - to this day, I honestly believe that equations, fractals, and math govern our universe and compose the afterlife. Is it my own personal LSD psychosis, or had I seen the afterlife?", "I have not and will never eat LSD again, for fear of my own sanity. I still attend the University of Florida, and I maintain good grades, but I frequently think back to that strange, revolutionary experience, and I always will. I honestly believe it was not just a giant, drug-induced hallucination, but was an actual glimpse into further dimensions and realities.", "I had been working at a new place for about a month and had made two really good friends, becca and jon, who had been dating for about a year. I had had numerous conversations with them about variuos trips they had and each one they told me made me more and more interested and curious about the drug. So one weekend they had invited me over to their house to party with them and I asked if they could possibly get any tabs for us to do together. Well they called around and at about 11:30 I got a call and they told me to come over because they had got the stuff. ", "When I showed up there were a few of their other friends who weren't planning on tripping that night, but it was all good because I knew them pretty well too. The kind of gel tabs that we got were yellow and we cut them with an exacto knife. I let the two tabs dissolve on my tounge and then went outside and joined my friends for a cigarette. They then told me that the stuff they had gotten was extremely good stuff and they had gotten it from a friend who had tried it and really liked it. Once we were done smoking we just talked for about 45 minutes until we started to feel a little weird.", "At first I felt stomach pains and I asked becca if that was normal and she said yes. I also felt the urge that I was building up to some sort of explosion inside my brain. I expressed this to becca and she looked at me quietly and said, 'I just exploded!' I was caught off-guard by this and by the time I returned to reality I could feel a sudden rush of thousands of thoughts and images floating around in my head all at once. ", "I was able to interact on a personal level with everyone at my friend's apartment, but my two good friends who were on the drug were on a seperate level with me that only we could understand each other. I layed down on a carpet that was on the floor. It was blue and had waves on it. As I lay there I began to feel as if I was in an ocean and started to swim around on the carpet. This rug felt as if it was the most comfortable rug I had ever layed on and I lay on it for at least an hour and a half just soaking up the texture and colors of the material. ", "After I got up and sat on the couch my friends, who are big ravers, busted out some glowsticks and we played with those for hours. They taught me how to dance to the music with the sticks and pretty soon I was better than some of the ravers. We then had a great idea and taped all the glowsticks to the fan and layed up at it with the lights off. All the different patterens that were made from the simple circle motion was amazing. There were hundreds of different things to pick out and follow. ", "After that we started to comedown, but the drug was still profoundly affecting me so I started looking around their house. I was combing the carpet when I saw a piece of a granola bar and had jon and becca come over and look at it. We were all throughly amazed by this piece of food and marveled about how it possibly got all the way to the floor. We then stayed up the rest of the night and watched the beautiful sun rise and I went back to my house around 7:30 A.M. feeling the best I had ever felt in my life. This is definitly an experience I will never forget.", "My experience last night on LSD was amazing.  My second time tripping, the first of which I had taken a red gel-tab which I had later felt expanded so much of my mind, and was very visual-oriented.  Last night...I felt GOD.  I was GOD.  See, in my 'clique' of friends there has been a lot of turmoil. So two of my closest friends and I decided to have a free night of fun.  We took the acid aware of the possibility that it could be fake, because one girl we were with during the purchase freaked out about it being a 'cheap hit'.  For the first hour, and almost the second, we were in extreme disappointment.  I've been taking Philosophy and doing well in it, and well...wanted to experience the insanity from last time, in my newly philosophical mind.  ", "Anyway, we end up driving on the New Jersey parkway (for no reason and with a designated driver) going 65 mph, in a rain storm.  My one friend and I ended up with our heads and naked upper torsos out the windows...experiencing first hand what we had stayed indoors and missed last time--NATURE!!  It was INCREDIBLE!   The air pressure was like a vacuum out there, the lights, the water, the speed, the power!!!!  I held my hand out in front of me, i felt rain going down my throat (my mouth was uncontrollably open) the rain hit my skin! OH MY GOD I TINGLED; I orgasmed mini-orgasms all through my body!  ", "The universe then, 'versed' beyond the back of my hand, and it flowed naturally, chaotically through my fingers and then--it shrunk.  I held all that existed in the palm of my hand...and I SCREAMED!!  The universe roared!!  The fact that I was holding all that existed and knew I was in the presence of God, showing me his power...the fact that the bottom half of my body was in the car did not even exist.  I was free.  I was flying.  I felt the universe in my hand, and I can't explain through words what I felt.  The power.  I was screaming out in this storm, out in this 65mph+ wind, in pure ecstasy.  My mind and body were in bliss.  I felt God's power!  In my hand!!(still outstretched from my soaking wet face as I'm screaming to the top of my lungs to my other 4 friends in the car what absolute, what orgasmic, POWER I was experiencing.)  ", "I heard my friend from the other side of the car in the front seat (I was in the back) screaming my name, and I knew she was experiencing what I was experiencing! Can't explain...a new reality, raw where I exist in ecstasy!  (effects similar to those of the drug, EXTASY). Normally due to the extreme wind, I think my hand would have buckled, and my lungs unable to take in the air, forcing me back in the car, but Now I was getting off on it!  I was defying it!  I was smacked right in the face by God himself!  I went into this trip, as a strongly positioned ATHIEST, and came out a touched man.  Touched by God himself.  Maybe you think it's the lsd?  But I felt Him.  I can't even begin to describe...It feels like millions of lifetimes have passed by in just these few short hours!!!  I feel as though I have experienced EVERYTHING!! And how foolish I was to be existing with all that exists and not KNOW in my heart that He exists too. God, OH GOD.", "I first became interested in LSD when I accidently stumbled across an LSD article in the dentist's waiting room.  The article told briefly of the commonly experienced psychadelics of LSD.  I had never really given LSD a second thought in the past, but after cross-examining it I felt as if I was missing out on something.  I decided to start researching the drug and also contacted a few individuals that I knew had used LSD.  ", "I've always been a very careful person when in comes to foreign chemicals.  I would always research a drug thoroughly, seeking both users' and non-users' facts and opinions. After about 3 months of bi-daily research, I had decided I had read virtually every information-bearing LSD website I could find. Thus I decided I was informed enough to ensure safety and enjoyability in my experience.  I went about obtaining some LSD by contacting a friend that I knew had used it in the past, and we planned a trip.  My first LSD trip took place at his house, in which I ingested one sugar cube, and acheived somewhat of a trip.  I was extremely giddy, and the experience as a whole was extremely positive. Unfortunately, the more cosmic, psychadelic effects that I'd expected were absent.", "The only hallucinations I experienced, besides the shadow of a branch that I saw as Medusa, were images I conciously manifested with my own imagination.  One of such images were a 'lizard man', a velociraptor with knee joints as humans, that was cloaked and squatting in the corner, flicking his tounge fiercly at me.  Once I manifested the image and it was in my vision, I felt an evil presence.  However, I quickly snapped out of this by reassuring myself that the drug had surely induced the vision. Even though I'd say that the hallucinations were enough to tell about, I didn't experience the complete alteration of time, space, matter, and thought that I hoped for.  I wondered if I didn't take enough LSD, and I presumed that perhaps I was more resistant to the drug than other people.  I decided on trying it again, this time from a different person and in a different form.   ", "I decided that the way I could acheive the trip I wanted was through more potent form of LSD.  Many people have told me their non-convincing experiences with paper-form LSD, and I decided I had to investigate for myself.  A few months after the first experience, I obtained 4 paper hits, and with my friend, took 2 each.  The effects were very familiar to the first trip.  Once again, I was giddy but no significant mild-alteration was present.  Just when I was ready to give up the quest for psychadelics my friend found another form.  He had met somebody, and he had obtained a few geltabs, thin squares of gelatin spotted with LSD.  I was given another hope.  We called another friend, and planned a trip.  It was to take place in some campgrounds we were to soon visit, a nice place with all the conveniences of the city (fresh water, heat, air condition) and all the wonders of nature.  It was surrounded by woods and a nice pond was nearby the house area.", "When the time came, it was me and my two friends, D and F.  I chose not to use their names because I haven't informed them of my plans to document the trip.  We had 4 yellow geltabs, and decisively distributed them among us.  Since F had never done LSD before, he would take 1, and me and D would take 1 1/2 each, us having some LSD experience.  We decided to go inside and play cards while waiting for the wonders to come.  After about 30-45 minutes of cards, I began to feel the same effects as my first two trips.  I looked at the clock, thinking at least an hour had passed, but was wrong.  I was roughly 35 minutes into the trip, and already was lost in thought.  It was if every thought would start a chain reaction in my head, activating more and more thoughts to the point that I was pondering several very different topics at one time. About 1 hour into the trip, playing cards became extremely difficult, as I was being bombarded by abstract and fragmented thoughts and ideas.  With all that was going on in my head, the last thing I was thinking about were the cards in my hand.  Giving my hand to F, I decided to sit and try to calm my brainstorm restfully.  ", "I was only resting for about 10 seconds before I caught some movement in the corner of my eye.  I saw the ceiling moving, taking on a flowing form, as if it was silk being blown by the wind.  Being the first visuals I had ever experienced, I was awe-stricken.  I sat and watched the movement spread onto more surfaces, noticing that the movement was stronger whenever I looked. I could see movement in the corner of my eye, but only when I looked directly at something would it shift and dance. After staring at the floor for several minutes, I decided to return to my friends.  'D,' I said. 'Are you feeling anything?' He gave me a blank look and cracked a smile at me.  His pupils, almost completely dominating the blue of his eyes, were all I needed to see. ", "It had only been a little over an hour, and we were all tripping.  We decided to take a walk outside, to see the newfound wonders of the surrounding area, despite the fact that it was around 10:00pm and very dark. We walked through a dimly lit path in the woods, and each tree we passed seemed characterized.  I felt as if I was walking among strangers, but an easy, relaxed feeling took over.  Despite the fact that I was walking into the dark woods, under the influence of a drug I had little grasp on, I didn't have an ounce of fear in me.  'Is it just me, or are these trees covered with a dark blue fog.' D said. I stopped and looked up at the treetops.  Among the almost pitch black treetops I saw beautiful patterns forming and changing, becoming more complex every second.  D was talking to me, but I didn't notice. I was awe-stricken.  ", "A tap on my shoulder got me out of the trance.  I turned around, and looked at D and F behind me.  It was extremely dark, and I tried to focus on their faces, but it was not their faces that I saw when I squinted at their extremely dimly lit heads.  As their faces came into view, they started taking on an evil, monster-like characteristic. I immediately thought back to reports I've previously read that described panic attacks upon seeing drug-induced and negative hallucinations. I told myself that it was impossible for them to be anything other than D and F, and despite what I saw I disregarded this and suggested we go back inside. We walked back inside, and upon arriving at the house I was overcome with another relaxing sensation.  I sat down on the couch, and was put into a  kind of a trance. ", "As I sat and pondered the situation, one thought branched into a chain of thoughts, followed by another branch of thoughts, and was thrown into a series of mental visualizations that simply blew my mind. I had a similar experience after eating 225 Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds and smoking cannabis about 3 hours later, 2 after my stomach rejected the seeds.", "'Lets go to the pond.' I suggested.  A quick walk through the woods would get us to our destination, a shining mirage of paradise in the moonlit night.  I visualized the pond. I saw the bright moon shining on the water, its sandy, beach-like shore (only on one side of the lake), and benches on the sand to relax on.  I smiled. 'Let's go.' We skipped over to D's care and extracted a few bowls of cannabis from his bag and headed blindly into the woods. We made our way through the woods, and upon doing this I noticed patterns on everything, and forming out of everything.  The leaves on the ground formed patterns, and the clouds in the sky formed patterns.  It was amazing.  I was busy staring at the pattern, and we got there quicker than I expected.  ", "I looked out at the lake, and sure enough, the moon lit up everything.  The reflection of the moon on the pond was shifting and moving. We walked over to a bench and sat down. D pulled out an 'irish' pipe and a bag of pot, and lit it accordingly. I took a couple of hits, and it wasn't until about 1 minute later that the peaking effects of the LSD returned in full effect.  I noticed the colors of the leaves on the ground melt together, the intense and rapid thought process returned. It took me by surprise, for part of the reason I wanted to smoke was that I suspected the LSD was wearing off.  I was mistaken however, because now I realize that they effects hadn't wore off at all, as if I was still on the trip's plateau.  I was only getting used to effects of the LSD... becoming accustommed to the moving surfaces and not thinking of it as abnormal.  I recognized how this could potentionally permanently damage my thinking process, and paid more attention to the psychadelia.", "I stood there for a couple of minutes, trying to remember the sequence of events preceeding the present time.  It was then I remembered I had a few 'Sparklers' in my pocket.  Sparklers are fireworks... you light the end of the long metal stick and sparks spew out of it for about 1 minute.  I pulled a Sparkler out, and lit it.  It took a few seconds to light, but once lit immediately exploded into a rage of sparks intensified by my hallucinations.  As I moved it around my vision, tracers followed it in a very flowy motion, and the path of the sparkler in my vision was revealed until the sparkler went out.  When it went out, my heart was racing.  I was amazed.  I turned around and looked at D and F, who were also left silent by the beautiful display of colors.  I lit a few more, and we smoked another bowl before heading back inside.", "The walk back was similar to the other treks through the dark woods. Everything I could see was a part of a beautiful pattern. D and F also saw patterns. Upon returning to the house, we all agreed that 4:00am was a reasonable time to go to sleep.  We went to bed, and though I'm still unsure whether they managed to go to sleep, I was in a complete state of insomnia.  I laid in bed for an hour or so before the effects of the pot took its toll on me and I passed out.", "I hope this report shines some light on the LSD experience, as reports submitted before mine helped me to better understand something I had no knowledge of. I believe that knowledge and preparedness are essential when it comes to hallicunagenic experimentation.", "Setting: The apartment of a pair of my friends, whom I'll call Sing (a woman) and Song (a man, her boyfriend). They were both experienced with LSD, Song especially taking very much an active interest in entheogens. The apartment was pretty nicely kept, not cluttered or anything like that. Your average college kid apartment. I arrived at about 10.30am, and didn't leave for 12 hours.", "Mindset: Pretty relaxed, but excited as this would be my first time on any hallucinogen. My previous experience was limited to THC, alcohol, and ephedrine. However, as I discovered, anything you've been thinking hard about in the past week or so will have a chance of making an appearance. Additionally, I had only smoked weed in the past week; no other substances besides maybe -- but I doubt it -- alcohol were in my system. However, I have a history of mild mental illness, mainly dysphoric depression, for which I'd been prescribed the antidepressant Celexa about two years previous.", "Preparations: I showed up, and we had some breakfast -- some pretty shitty biscuits that Song made with too much salt, which we ate drenched in honey to try and disguise that fact. We had drums at the ready, and paints and paper. The paints play a pretty significant part in this, actually. We ate, and then after clearing the table covered it with an expendable cloth in case we got wild with the washable paints: watercolours and this bizarre glitter stuff in numerous pastel shades. I also brought over some headphones at Sing's request, and some music I enjoy -- 'Dead Inside' by the Golden Palominos. I carried with me as well a small notebook and a pen, as I intended to do my best to transcribe the experience.", "Dosage: Imprecise. I suspect we each had 2-3 hits of indeterminate potency at first and then about an hour later we took 1-2 more as a booster. We dropped by simply swallowing the tabs with orange juice.", "After we dropped and were waiting for the effects to begin, I felt giggly, but I think that was only due to being excited. Song put on some music -- Radiohead's 'Kid A' -- and got online, looking for things to entertain us. We found various pieces of pattern software and eventually settled on WinAmp's visual interpretation of the music, which I think would have been pretty mesmerising in the best of times, but then, I am by nature easily visually distractable.", "So we sat around staring at this, and looking for other craziness online, we then took the booster, and got the paints out.", "It was then that things started to get funny. I discovered the joy of tracers, waving a paintbrush handle through the air, and then my hand, I was enthralled. I painted with the watercolours then, idly smearing colour across the page to no especial end. Song had gotten an old furniture magazine out and was amusing himself to grand heights by painting all the curtains and furniture and such in the interior design photos red or yellow or green. Sing was very quiet, intent on her painting of some interminable blob, cast in hues of pastel glitter-flecked yellow.", "I didn't realise it at the time, but the trip proper was beginning. I percieved things as strangely kindergartenish, as 'little-kid' in a distinctly unholy way. I dismissed it as a perceptual flashback to times past, when sitting at a table painting actually was a small child's activity. But this was not the extent of it.", "Song put on a new CD -- he had since changed Radiohead to REM, which he now changed to Tripping Daisy's 'Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb.' The trips were arriving in force now, and we were sprawled around. Song was glued to the CD player, Sing was lolling in a chair, and I was scribbling furiously in my notebook.", "So what was happening to me? I was regressing. I found myself entangled in strings of pink bubblegum, which gave the impression of being too sweet to be really that sweet -- like a corrupted, poisoned candy our parents used to warn us the Satanists would hand out at Hallowe'en. Entwined in that bubblegum was a creature, a thing whose name I could hear in my mind and which I desperately tried to spell, but was impronouncable by human tongues, as was the concept that some things would have to remain in this trip and never come to light while lucid. Now, I call the thing the Mouse-King.", "It was rotting amid the sea of gum and candy, corruption and decay falling off of it like bark from a dead tree in a swamp. It had a mouse's half-rotten head on which perched a crown, but it would also change into a massive tongue studded with eyeballs and festooned with gaping, tooth-filled mouths. It presided over a playground on which children cavorted, but the playground was false, a cover -- beneath the sugar-coated surface lurked something hellish, dark. The overwhelming sense was that nothing is as good and innocent as it appears.", "This gave way to a tormented sense of loss and regret, that my own innocence had been tainted this way, that it was happening to children all over and I was powerless to protect them. I then sort of... devolved, into a protohuman state of consciousness, in which the ego has yet to develop and the id reigns... and yet, I was still in control, and indeed, quite self-conscious. Dust from the floor seemed to soil me incomparably and I was terrified I'd say something out loud that would betray my state and ruin the trips of my friends. But it was like being granted a look through the mists of evolution, both macrobiological evolution and the moral development of individual human beings. I knew what it was to be a child, to be unfettered by social mores -- now that I think of it, that may also be what it's like to be a sociopath.", "I went to the bathroom, which was an ordeal -- trying to make sure I had not already wet myself while going is not easy on this stuff. Looking in the mirror was unbearable.", "I came out and talked to Song, who was on about music -- he is a musician, and so is very exicted about music when he trips -- when I caught sight of the back of the Tripping Daisy CD. It features a circus parade where all the animals and people have cuts of meat superimposed over their faces. This was terrifying and confusing. The music was not helping, either -- heard lucid, it's very happy stuff, but in my state all I could percieve was the darkness of it. The whistling, chanting children on some of the songs became a demon choir heralding the loss of all goodness to a world that eats its young.", "Poor Song... he had to go and sign for a package, which contained some miscellaneous amplifier cord or some such. He was traumatised. ;)", "This continued... we went back to the paints and I painted in tortured blobs of pink. The word 'help' is scratched into the layers of it in one of them.", "We began to come down. The tracers continued but we were lucid again, although unable to communicate very well -- Sing and Song had been reading Sartre, so the inability to get one's point across was fresh on their minds, and mine as well -- the impronouncable words and concepts were recurring every minute. We ate pasta, and it was the best goddamn pasta I ever had.", "Hours later, I drove home. I was so tired I collapsed immediately, and my mind refused to dream.", "This is the story of the first time I had acid. It scared me incredibly, as I had no knowledge at all of the strength of LSD.", "The first tab of Acid I had was called a '3D Parallelogram' which were going around Sydney in 1995. These were reportedly (in hindsight) extremely strong tabs. I was in Year 9 at high school at the time. I bought it off a friend who had never used acid before who told me that acid was similar to marijuana in it strength level. Therefore, about 10am I preceded to drop 1 whole acid trip. This would commence what was one of the scariest drug experiences of my life.", "At approximately 10:30am I started tripping in history class. The teachers face started morphing, and I just prayed that he didn't ask me any questions. At morning break, around 11am, I went up to my friend who sold me the trip and explained to him how fucked up I was. He told me that he had licked the plastic bag out which the trip came in, and he was even tripping off that! ", "So, after morning break I decided to go for a walk out in the city to try and stem the increbile psychedelic visions going through my mind. Luckily, one of my closest buddies had also dropped acid that day for the first time so we stuck together. Venturing into a cafe to have a coffee, and hopefully to try and get my head together, I suddenly had the feeling that everything was in 'fast-forward' mode. It was like a 20 minute period would pass in a matter of seconds. Sounds, and images, were sped up to a blurry pace. It was only when I dropped a little sugar on the table in front of me in the cafe, and I noticed the little pieces of sugar talking to me, and then running away from me, that I realised how messed up I was.", "Upon returning to school I went straight to the sick-bay with my mate and we stayed there until school finished a 3 pm. In this period I had some incredible journeys into my mind. Tunnels of psychedelic patterns engrossed me. I also had hallucinations of snakes tunneling around the room underneath the carpet.", "Once the bell at 3 pm went off we were free to leave. Being paranoid, I approached the secretary and asked her if I was in fact, free to leave. She told me that I was so I took a moment in front of her desk to put my school jumper on. Before I put the jumper on I noticed the clock read 3:01pm. I struggled for a little while to put the jumper on and one I had completed this task I looked again at the clock and it now read 3:15pm. I looked at the secretary and she gave me a really funny look!!", "I made it home in one piece, but along the way experienced a few stange encounters with strangers with whom I got paranoid with.", "All together it was a good warning about the power of acid, and the conclusion was that it should be taken rarely, and only with a great deal of care. I have taken a great deal of MDMA since, and I have never experienced anything so 'bone-shaking' as this LSD experience."], "mdma": ["It's so funny how there are such drastic differences between 2 people with the same drug.  I am a very experienced person with ecstacy, and I've had well over one hundred hits in the last 4 years.  I have to say that at no time has ecstacy lost it's magic for me.  I just recently (last weekend, 9/16/00) dropped 2 hits of blue tweeties in one night and I rolled harder than I've ever rolled before.  And 2 hits is the most I've ever done in a night, my regular dosage is 1 hit per night when I'm partying.  I do sometimes take a month break between binging for months, so maybe that's why.  But I have a friend who has dropped with me several times, and he has reported to me a loss of effects after maybe 10 hits during this year...", "Other than some pot, I lived a drug free existence.  A close friend, over several months, talked me into trying E.  The first time was terrifying, mainly because of my own fear.  Instead of trying to act tough, I should have had more trust.  Upset stomach, confusing visuals, rise in body temperature, etc, scarred the heck out of me.  After that I did my research. I would have been more relaxed if I research before I did it.", "I now party about once a month, usually taking 2 pills about an hour apart.  I have a meal at least two hours before ingesting.  That will leave no food in my stomach.  I've only gotten sick once since my initial trip.  On party day, I take 500 mg of vitamin C in the morning & 500 more with an evening meal.  I also load up on Magnessium - that helps reduce jaw clenching.  I take one tab of 5HTP in the morning also.   I take two more 5HTP capsules about 30 minutes before ingesting E.  For me, it makes the trip last longer and is more intense.  Oral doses of E are easier to ingest.  Snorting ground up tabs is nasty, intense burning.  Would never inject anything into my veins.  The most intense trip I've had was taking it rectally.  A little bit of lube and pushing it in about an inch & a half.  The rolls lasted twice as long and it came on really fast.  The music pleasantly pounded my chest and the lights were fantastic.  Hang out with trusted friends and learn to party responsibly.  Know when to say no'.  People get hurt mixing a lot of drugs together -avoid that and you'll be OK.", "It was the long awaited night of my first rave, I have always wanted to go to one because all my friends constantly did but I never had the time to.  Then came the night, everything was organized, we got the pills beforehand and pre-sale tickets and everything.  I arrived at about 10:00 and walked around and got used to the atmosphere and I was having a great time without the pill and was thinking that I didn't need to take it but around 11:00 I just swallowed it for the hell of it.", "I asked around about the pill I took (Octagon) and everyone was giving me the same answer and it was a great pill.  I got my mind off that I just took a pill and started dancing, when the main DJ came on the main room was crowded and we were all having a great time, then I remember I blinked and it looked as if I had water in my eyes because everything was all bright, then I took a deep breath and I thought I was having an orgasm.  My knees went weak and I fell to the floor in pure bliss, never has anything in life come close to the feeling I got.", "I pulled myself up and this girl came up to me and looked me in the eyes and hugged me and rubbed my back and it was incredible.  Every step I would take would send waves of pleasure through my body, I started talking with new people and they were all so friendly giving me money for drinks and candy to wear.  It was truly heaven, pure peace, what man has been striving for so long, inside of a club.  I couldnt help but dance wildly whenever I moved because it became such a delight.  Every minute that passed the feeling became more intense like a warm massage from the inside.", "I was so energetic yet so relaxed and in such a perfect mood, around 11:45 I just couldnt stand up anymore and fell into the middle of a cuddle-puddle. I felt hands all over my body and the smell of vicks all around, I closed my eyes and drifted off.  Nothing could compare to what I was feeling.  My eyes started rolling into the back of my head but I was feeling so good nothing mattered, the night flew by with nothing but positive things happening, when I started to comedown around 6:00 I reflected what a wonderful experience it was.", "People know what goes on in these clubs, no one is hurt, people just go to have a wonderful time and everybody does.  I didn't see anyone fighting or getting in a drunken rage like so many other clubs I've been to.  This was truly a Utopia.  Ever since then, nothing has come close to the fun factor that I had that night, I havn't taken E again at the other 4 times I attended Raves because I want the greatest night of my life to be as special as possible.", "I can understand how this can be habit forming, next to Heroin, there is no other pleasure in life this great, it is the true pinnacle of the human psyche, ultimite happiness for 5 hours, but like everything in life, it comes with a price.", "A few monts ago I decided that I wanted to try extasy, should the opportunity present itself.  I wouldn't go searching, but I would be open to it.  My boyfriend had a week off this week, and suggested that he get some pills and we have an art day.  I made arrangements so that I could disappear for the day and turn off the phone.  (I've discovered with pot that I internalize alot, and didn't want to be thinking about ANYTHING else other than the experience.)  ", "He insisted that I research experiences on the erowid vaults, and I was really glad I did.  My nerves were calmed by having some sort of an idea of what to expect.", "I took the pill at 10:00AM and we decided to go get coffee and sit and chill for a while.  I was STARVING and ordered a bagel (despite the warnings that I wouldn't want it in another 15 minutes).  We were sitting on couches, chatting, watching people and I kept waiting.  But it wasn't anxious, it was just a soft feeling of 'I wonder when it'll happen'.", "I kept looking at the people, and all of a sudden I knew it was coming.  (This was about 10:30) A few seconds later I felt a washing feeling of warmth over my body.  I felt a slight vertigo as if I was falling gently backward in a semi circle.  But it wasn't a surprising feeling at all, I felt that the feeling was extremely familiar. He asked to see my eyes and asked how I felt, and I was aware that I felt GOOD and very giggly.  Just happy and giddy and REALLY excited to be sitting on a big comfy couch.  He put his arm around me and just rubbed my hands and my hair.  It felt so content and mellow.  And I sure didn't want that bagel.  I got really cold at one point, but a sweater cured that.  ", "After a little bit he suggested that we go somewhere else.  Which was good because I was VERY stuck on that couch.  As soon as we were outside I was excited to be moving on the street, as the movement felt more like floating and really fulfilling.  But once again I felt that this was a place I had been before...I have felt that excited at life before, but this time it seeemed like it was more pure.    ", " Then he pointed out a siren and I stopped in the middle of the street and listened and looked at him, and I felt as if we were the only two people on earth and it was spinning around us.  But it was if the way I feel about him on a regular basis was suddenly free of the bullshit of daily life and I was suddenly allowed to just love him freely.  I just wanted to stop and be there together...I wanted him to be where I was at but I felt that he wasn't so we kept walking.", "We walked but it was really hot, and so we decided that we should go somewhere.  I really felt a strong desire to lay in the grass and people watch but he wasn't there with me.  (We would've had to drive and find parking and it was way too hot anyway).  I was bummed for about 3 seconds.  I just didn't want to be in transit.  I wanted to be somewhere.  So we got in the car and I layed in the seat all the way back and he put on electronic music for me.  (It all of a sudden made sense).  ", "We went back to his house and just got naked, mostly for comfort.  The skin to skin touch was amazing, We started playing with our bodies, and eventually started having sex.  OH MY GOD.  People supposedly say that sex and extasy don't mix.  I totally disagree.  Perhaps it's because I'm an extremely sexual person by nature, so to go to that place is very comfortable for me.  We had sex continually for over 2 hours.  It was amazing.  I kept feeling like I would have an orgasm, but never did, but didnt' feel bummed about it....I just wanted to feel the way I was feeling.  It was unihibited and animal but at the same time tender...Uhhhhhh.  We had music on and at one time I realized that I was moving my body with the music, but not to the music.  I wasn't even aware of it.  It was as if the music came into my body and moved it around.  ", "But every once in a while (and I think it was when I was rolling in) I would feel like I needed more than just physical affection, and really longed for him to be tender and loving.  I would feel myself becoming a little preoccupied with being in a different place than he was, or feeling more intense feelings that he was.  It was a softer version of the paranoia I get from pot, and instead of feeling nervous about it, I just felt aware of it.  I just wanted to look in his eyes because the love I felt inside needed to be reciprocated to be realized.  I would start to internalize but it didn't upset me.  And I knew that emotions were running high because of the drug, so I didn't get too preoccupied with it.  Then it would pass.", "We smoked some pot and layed around.  That really mellowed me out even more.  It dulled my extreme feelings and made me totally content with touch and sleep.  I kept drifting in and out of consciousness, and I just felt soooo relaxed.  We eventually got up and showered although I was very hard to motivate.  I felt like I wanted to be in the couch forever.  (And I felt aware that on a regular basis I would get up if he said so just because, but i was too relaxed to care and definitely made him MAKE me get up.)", "We went and picked up a friend and drove to our respective activities for the night.  Was I mellow.  It was rediculous.  I was so zoned out, and really felt completely wiped out.  But I drank a large coffee and went to my rehearsal.  Now at this point it was definitely way over, but I still was very aware of those feelings.  Not the physical affects, but the feelings.  My rehearsal was very content and I loved talking to the people there that I didnt' really know very well.  And it was a very touchy rehearsal, and I was still digging that.  (Although I very much enjoy touch on a regular basis, but suddenly I felt very aware and unapologetic for it).  Afterward, a friend and I sat outside and smoked some more pot, and it just felt good.  But tired.", "I woke up today and didn't feel bad.  A few times yesterday toward the end I felt down, but it passed quickly.  But I'm realizing that what seems to be most affecting me is my interactions with him.  When I realized that I wouldn't see him all day, I got VERY down.  But being very self aware and knowing that depression can follow, I'm not going to let that disappoint me. But what I've kept with me is the amazing way that I felt walking down the street, and talking to people, and that seems to keep picking me back up.  And since its something I've felt before, I feel like I can definitely recall it without extasy.  (That's not to say that I'm done with it.....)", "After 4 previous sessions with these same lovely pills and each better than the last I was indeed excited about this one.  This time I was going to take two and make it a grand finale before I take a good two month break as to not overstress by body.  ", "As usual I was excited and got home immediatly and was so anxious that I took the pills without plans.  I was hoping I could get out the house before they hit with my parents around.  I called around, surely I could go somewhere, but no luck, I tried for 30 min and began to get really worried that I would be stuck at home.  This is what scared me, I was in a real bad mind-set, which has never happened before in my 40+  times rolling, I have never had a bad roll in my life.  I figured I could just listen to music and have fun, but I was just so lonely, and was sitting waiting for the pills to kick in and make me 'happy'.", "After an hour, nothing, I was getting worred now, I looked in the mirror and my pupils were normal...I just sat and waited, an hour and 30 min later I started to feel a little twinge and thought this was it, but it just stayed like that and dropped down, I looked in the mirror and my pupils were huge, but I felt nothing, then I just thought about how much fun I could be having if I was out, and I got real depressed.  It was really horrible, I tried to get into a good mindset with the music and closing my eyes but I just got more and more depressed, I was feeling so very tired and cold, I started shaking and and got under 8 layers of blankets but still I was cold.  I didnt want to get up and drink water because I was so tired, I have never felt like this on a roll before, I closed my eyes (it was about 2 1/2 hours after ingesting the pills) I just layed and drifted off and then I started to open my eyes, my cd was off and the sun was coming through, it was 11:37 in the morning..this was horrible, how could I fall asleep...I knew these pills were MDMA as they were tested and were the same kind as before, but could my mood could of changed it that much, I am now worried about my next roll, if my bad mood could make two pills so ineffective.", "It was the week before new years, a mildly cold friday night. Only a few days ago on the tuesday a good friend and I who had been together awhile before had sex while drunk. Given the situation in which we were, this was the last thing we should have done. R, as I will call her, turned up during the evening, and it was obvious there were tensions between us, the idea of my invite was that we could work out the situation. We had planned to do the MDMA the next day together with some other friends. I had not ingested any substances in the past two weeks before the experience.", "I was feeling rather tense and quite anxious to try and resolve the issue before us. We rented a video, a slap-stick comedy which I had heard of, but neither of us had seen.", "We watched a documentary first, The Mushroom Man, Gordon Wasson and other eccentrics. R had never seen the film before, and this had inspired her as to the appropriatness of altered states of conciousness. R felt it more correct to take the MDMA that night, where we were alone, the night was calm and the setting was familiar without too many novel distractions, to her it was the perfect time for an experience of more than pure recreation.", "I found it hard to agree simply due to the fact that two other people were to attend tomorrow, a point where we would all get together and have fun. However I took to her opinion and we ingested 100mg of MDMA powder each.", "We decided to turn on the next video. Initially I felt good about watching it, relaxed, but quickly anticapation got the better of me. I felt anxious about the experience, giddy in the stomach.", "Intellectually unmoved, I feel uncomfortable and strange, the feeling is not new, but it is getting in the way of my focus of thought.", "Anticapation disappears at an undefined moment, the window opens at no point in time. Am I always here? Why am I here now? Intellectually it makes no sense. Time is undefined, it is purely a learned concept. Everything changes.", "The rest of the events are blurred in bliss. We talked, we understood. We kissed, it was right. We solved the problem by telling each other what we felt without fear of repurcussion. Truth may sometimes be inappropriate, but if it is so inappropriate, why did it feel so good?", "The feeling is still there, so much emotional energy, an ability to communicate like never before. With the issue we had before us resolved, R and I turned on some Mozart, it was however not energetically moving enough, instead I put on some dream trance. The music took us to another realm of celebration. The moment that we shared, the abstract concept of the energy we exchanged on a wholistic level cannot be explained intellectually. The experience will forever remain with me, the life and love that was spent through this experience with ripple through reality forever. I am grateful to be.", "We continue to dance and enjoy each others company. The observing mind is beginning to return. ", "With the effects fading we begin to go to bed, unable to sleep I go for a run. Upon returning, as I drift of to sleep strange thoughts creep into my mind, the creepy thoughts continue to pervade. I try to resolve the intellectually, but thoughts of death and anger boil deep within me. I leave those thoughts for another time, falling asleep without too much effort.", "In the morning I ingested some 5-HTP and other minerals and supplements, as usual appetite was none, but I still ate well.", "I found this to be the most profitable and appropriate drug experience I have ever had, along side a LSD experience three weeks later, but that is another story.", "R also noted she had strange and creepy thoughts after the experience, an interesting side note.", "I am fairly experienced with e, but this was a particularly enlightening roll.  I was at a three day rock festival with a group of friends.  It was quite enjoyable...very bohemian--no electricty, minimal plumbing, and best of all, no family matters to worry about.  A couple of people in our group had been rolling non-stop for the entirety of our stay.  I had been trying to get my own, but alas, it seemed to no avail. On the third night, I began talking to people at the neighboring campsite and found they had a few buddhas to sell.  Joy!  ", "I took the roll at about 11:45 pm, the same time as my boyfriend.  I started rolling about 30 minutes later and just kicked back beside the campfire.  I ran my hands through the dewey grass and was in heaven!  I was a little upset, however, because my boyfriend (who had gotten his roll elsewhere) wasn't feeling the effects after 3 hours.  ", "At about 4:45 am, I began to get chilly (the fire had long since died out) and went into our camper.  My boyfriend followed, as he was still not rolling, and had given up on it.  We laid down on the mattress together and just cuddled.  It was incredible!  (Now I should preface this next part by explaining that I'm of a pagan religion.  I believe that I have spirit guides.  I had long been searching for my spirit guides through meditation, but none were specifically clear to me.)  As I lay in the sleeping bag next to my boyfriend, I let my vision wander to the window of the motor home.  I saw great big butterflies in all shades of mauve, pink, and purple.  I started giggling around the pacifier that was planted firmly in my mouth.  I then looked at my boyfriend (who after 5 hours, had finally started rolling) and smiled and touched his cheek.  I then looked down at my pillow case (blue in color) and saw an ocean with dolphins playing and leaping.  At this point, I heard a whisper say to me 'Your free spirit is much like that of the dolphin.  Take it's nature and incorporate it with your own.'  ", "I've never cried while on e, but this was an incredibly moving experience.  My boyfriend looked at me and asked if something was wrong.  I just shook my head and smiled (around the pacifier) at him and gave him a huge hug.", "I now have a necklace with a dolphin pendant that I wear when I feel tied down by things (school, stress...whatever), and when I touch it, I feel the same warm fuzzies I got from the e that night.", "Divorced in my mid forties and living in Asia. High stress position in University setting. On vacation in Batam, Indonesia.", "Took an invitation to experience Ecstasy (for the first time) with a beautiful young Indonesian/Malay woman in late 20's about 10 p.m. at the local club. One hour later...Erica and I are tracing the beauty of her high cheekbones with both of our entwined fingers. I was only drinking water.", "I felt mounting insight just after the drug 'rushed' palpabally into my extremeties. I had friends visiting with me on this 'boys' weekend in Indonesia from USA and our mutual love for each other became quite easy to express. I individually told each guy how much I appreciate and care for them and two of them..not on MDMA..kind of shrugged me off. My other and closest buddy (who took MDMA) smiled and allowed me to hang physically close to him without any reservations and it just continued to grow as an experience of pure love.", "Then I hit the rave floor! Whoa! Danced up to assorted women and Indonesian men and touched foreheads and rythymically and synchronously moved our heads back and forth. I would just look at a person and their smile back seemed to be a conversation of deep and spiritual insightful processing.", "Shared an Ecstasy pill with Erica about T + 4:00 Hours after first ingestion. The half took me to closing at 0630 a.m.", "In our hotel room. Turned off all lights,lit candle and got the baby oil. She is a strong Island girl from Aceh and I weightlift so we just took our mutual knowledge of deep muscle massage and touched for hours, but with incredible force and torque. Before I would 'bust a move' and pick her upside down to force blood to her head so I could deep massage her skull and brush her long black hair...she would shift her body as if knowing my plan. Quite incredible.", "Later...after lovemaking which inevitably followed..she indicated that she has insight with jungle animals moods and desires and learned to 'talk' to them in her native village as a girl.", "'I hold snake and tell him I understand and he stops hissing and accepts me.'", "Hmmmmmm. O.K. But knowing the Indonesian culture, it felt that as a 'bule' or 'white ghost' (Caucasian)...I was gaining insight into things that previously were hidden from my American culture.", "Whatever. Rested could not sleep. Had psychic closed eyes conscious hallucinations or 'brain movies.' Felt unburdened by all that had burdened me but in a way that gave me hope to deal positively with what I would face tomorrow. Ordered room service and massaged and touched all day. Went out that night again at 10 p.m. and did it all over again.", "But this time stayed at Erica's side and we both swayed and stayed extremely physically close, with the same level of MDMA..but with an added half hit as we left at 0630 am. But that extra hit put Erica in great need of having her hands deep massaged in order to lull her to sleep. Slept till noon and we parted.", "        I took around 1/3 of a crown and dissolved it in warm water. It dissolved rapidly without even stirring it... wonder whats in the pill besides MDMA? Anyway, I took it down at 1:56. I'll probably need to supplement, and I'll probably take more at 2:30, enough to leave me with half the pill. I don't know if I'll take a hit of MeO, but its an idea. It's 2:17 and I've had a warm feeling for a few minutes, the first signs of effect. I plan to write alot this trip... thats my primary motivation this time, in fact. I'm going to go prepare the booster dose now.", "        I went to make the booster and noticed some powder I'd spilled, so I added it as well. I put in about 1ml of 70 proof vodka to help speed absorption (just a guess). I took it at 2:30, so I've got about 1/2 of a Crown in me now. Since the amount I spilled was pretty big, I probably won't feel alot until this second dose hits me. Guess I'm going to be up pretty late!", "        Definately beginning to feel effects! There is a pervasive body warmth. Sound has a different quality to it... Sort of as if drifting by. In a way its a lot like the way sounds seem at the tail end of an acid trip. Colors are much more vibrant than normal, and there is a sharpness or crispness to things. Depth perception is dramatically enhanced. I'm getting the beginnings of mild nystagmus (eye-wiggle) as well. I hear wind chimes outside, other than that things are quite silent. The come-on from MDMA is very different from traditional psychedelics. With LSD for example, its a steady gradual climb. MDMA seems to come on in steps. First nothing. Then physical sensations. Then the stage I'm in now, with visual and auditory changes. Then the full effect. And of course the sensations are pretty different. This stage reminds me a lot of the tail end of LSD, before I fall asleep. There's even a strange sort of almost-tiredness that usually hits right before the peak... the desire to lay down and curl up - but not to actually sleep. I'm starting to feel it now, actually. If I lean back and close my eyes, I have an undefined sensation of motion, as if flying ot maybe falling. I'm going to lie down and turn out the lights and let the peak come on.", "        Damn! A lot more time passed than I expected. Almost half an hour since I turned out the lights. I've been in my peak for a while. Laying in bed, I was having a pretty entactogenic trip. I thought about alot of mundane things, examining a lot of things going on in my life right now, nothing that's unusually interesting. Eventually it shifted into thoughts about various women in my life, mostly ones from long ago, and oddly, a lot of them girls I never had any real romantic interest in (consciously at least). MDMA has a very feminine nature, so I guess its only natural...

I've got 2 1/2 Crowns left, and I don't want to waste them. I've done it 4 weekends in a row, and I'm not getting near as much from it this time. Taking a hit of MeO feels like it would be a waste, but if I smoke some pot, I'll be in a nice, mellow place for writing. Right now, though, I'm almost kind of bored. Well, no, that's misleading. It's more just the realization that this E could've been put to better use another time.", "        Pot definately helped some... I mean, I like where I'm at and where I've been tonight, its just not the full potential of MDMA. (4:20, toke!) This is purely recreational, not psychedelic.", "Actually, the pot's helping *alot*! Pot and MDMA have a really good synergy. There's a very noticable visual enhancement and physical sensation. I wonder if my lowered reation to the E is due to lowered serotonin levels (well, besides just plain tolerance)? I should probably take steps to increase my serotonin after doing MDMA 4 weeks in a row. High tryptophan foods and all.", "I've got a strong desire to write, but I dont know about what.", "        Fuck! It just hit me... I was thinking 'What should I write about, I'm just sitting here writing about the effects.' Then I realized I'd fallen for a trap for novice trippers, and felt dumb. I've been trying to control or direct it, wanting things to go one way when it wanted to go another. I should've let things ride with the initial entactogenic phase... I wanted to write though I've got nothing to write about. You can't force an MDMA trip to go a certain way, any more than any other psychedelic. Fighting it is counterproductive. On acid, it can make you have a bad trip. On E, its like the E just gives up and you get a feeling of wasting your time. I took a half hit, with some sort of tolerance from doing it every week, and it should be a mild introspective trip. Realizing that, and letting go of my internal resistance, everything instantlly got better. Tonight's not for writing some long psychedelic revelation. It's for chilling out, thinking about life and friends, and good things, and just relaxing and being. It's not too late, and I think this in itself is a revelation.", "I am 39 years old and have avoided drugs, save for times smoking pot and one line of coke about 15 years ago.  People assume that I so conservative that I would freak out over any drug use.  ", "   My business partner and I have been very close friends for many years. He is 29 and far more liberal than I.  Last June he began several conversations about ectasy.  Because of my responses - 'anyone would have to be nuts to fool with any of that stuff' - he dropped the subject.  Following several more attempts to introduce the subject, he finally admitted in September - 'Don't flip out' that he tried MDMA.  He also convinced me to at least try it.  I did.  Like many the first time was terrifying, 'Oh God, why did I agree to this?'  Vomitting, total lack of control.  I now realize that the discomfort was caused more by anxiety than by the drug. My partner never left my side, even when I had my head in the bowl.  He was very reassuring.

I have witnessed girls exhibiting bisexuality in clubs & at parties.  Within the past two months, my partner & I, both straight and married, have become physically closer.  Two weeks ago while our wives were aways we went 'skinny dipping' and ended up achieving erections.  There has been no oral contact, just touching.  Neither of us are awake of homosexual tendencies when not rolling.  Now there seems to be a whole new element to partying. It feels good, it's enjoyable, there's no shame even though it's not discussed when sober.  I have no sense of switching sides, we just enjoy the experience.  I'm wondering if I discovered a side of me that I didn't know existed or is it just an extension of the touchy-feely nature of MDMA.  In the past we have shared girls, but this is new.  I am a very secure person and confident of who I am.  While I wouldn't share this with associates, I thought it may be helpful if someone else has a similar experience.", "ok.....most of the time I wouldnt really comment about anything I read on the internet, but the write up about the loss of magic of mdma was way too familiar to me, to not comment about. Me and a couple of my best friends broke away from the traditional party scene about a year and half ago to enter the after hours club, heavy drugs scene. For a period of about 9 months is a total blur to me now. All I remember is going to a dirty old afterhours club, hanging out with other club rats, and getting fucked up beyond belief a couple nights a week from around midnight to eight AM. Since then, I moved away to go to school and only go back about once a month to try and reenact those FUCKED UP days. Its just NEVER the same, the vibe is different, the drugs are WEAK, and I just have mysef questioning what the fuck I was doing. Hangovers from tabs are hell now, from just taking one or two.

Completely unlike myself, I just go sit down with her and her friends, start taking to them, and talking her into massaging me and rubbing her bunny on my head and face.  Nothing could match the way I physically felt.  I was clear headed, but every sense was x10.  I could feel the bass, I was in a trance to the music, any completely touchy-feely.  I would have been completely content touching everyone and everything around me.

After that night, I knew exactly who my true friends were - it was a startling discovery.  I always thought of them as friends, but never as the people who would take a bullet for me.

Waves of pure excitement and joy rolled in and out and through me. As they did, a thought came to me. All of the depression I had ever felt about the sickness and conflict in the world was lifted, and I lept up onto the hood of my geo metro and said, 'Guys, listen. I just figured something out! I don't know why I never knew this before, but all the evil that is in the world, is just because of misunderstanding. People think they are not loved, and because of this they are hurting.

I have had the chance to have 3 very good strong trips with a large group of beautiful, energy filled people.  I thought it might be a good idea if I tossed out some of the things that came up on our last trip, which happened this past friday.", "All 18 of us arrived at the campsite at about 7:30 or 8:00 pm.  After some setup and initial minor problems we finally dropped at 9:00.  We were camping at Honeyman Camp grounds, right next to the sand dunes, 9 miles south of Florence, Oregon.  Once we dropped, we grabbed all our stuff and headed for the dunes.", "After the first dune we had to climb from the road in the campground, our hearts were pumping.  We sat down just at the top and rested for a bit.  One of our group walked off to a higher point and begged all of us to follow.  Upong getting to the spot he had found, we saw in the western sky the full moon just beginning to rise.  It was colored a deep yellow orange. As it slowly/quickly rose (as you stared at it, it took for ever, but if you looked away and looked back it had jumped up), the feelings in me rose.  I got my first real taste of the trip when I felt some tingles and decided to run down the dune we were on.  Oh the rush!", "A particularly interesting thing I noticed and have noticed the other two times is the initial period of discomfort that some people feel just at the onset, particularly novices (I got it for a minute or two on the first trip in the beginning of April, though my second MDMA trip altogether).  The discomfort would last no longer than 10 or 15 minutes, then the person would suddenly feel better, charged, and eXtatic.  My theory on this discomfort is that as the drug begins to take effect, the mind and body are not prepared for the new sensations and energies that are flowing through them, and a discord is struck until the mental patterns harmonize with the X induced waveform (if that makes any sense).", "Anyway, we ended up breaking up into small groups and running back into each other for a while.  At one point, I searched out three others who were two dunes away.  As I crested one dune and made my way into the valley of the next, something was nagging at my brain.  When I stopped in the valley between the two dunes I noticed what it was: silence, absolute silence.  At the crest, you could here the ocean rumbling, some birds, some frogs, and some talking in the distance.  But in the valley, there was nothing.  It is really rare in this day and age to experience pure absolute silence and it was beautiful.  I proceeded to find the three others, whereupon two of them initated a bout of singing 'Wish You Were Here' by Pink Floyd.  I love to sing normally, and singing with the two other guys was such a thrill!", "We were keeping perfect time with each other, and it sounded (and felt) marvelous.  The girl that was with us at this time was feeling a little discomfort, and I needed some water, and one of the guys needed to ramble, so we split, with the lone guy wandering off, and three of us walking back to the moon spot.  After getting some water,and mulling about I decide wanted to ramble too.  At about this point, me and a friend realized that we were soon apporaching the point where those who were going to take supplements should be taking them. The friend who wandered off alone was taking one, but didnt know.  So three of us set off to find him.  When we reached the spot of splitting up, he was not within hearing range (we have a HEMP call that we use to find each other).", "So two of us decided to press on while the other went back to take his and inform the others (us two weren't taking the supplement).  We proceeded on, over a couple of dunes, calling now and then, talking to each other (this was the guy's first MDMA trip, so great time to open himself up and connect with each other).  We passed a pool and proceed up another dune.  About half-way up we decided to stop, rest have a cig., and that we would call at the top of the dune, and if we couldnt find him, go back to the others (we knew the wanderer would be allright, he likes to ramble off a lot, experienced tripper, done X a couple times, all of the three in the last month with me).", "We turned around and sat down and were at the most BEAUTIFUL spot.  There was a little fat-bannana shaped pool of water, with a little hump in the middle-curve of it, with some forest to the right, moon reflecting of the pond, wavering in the ripples, sky full of stars (perfectly clear night), frogs croaking in their oh so trippy way.  We sat there for awhile talking, looking at the stars (at one point we saw a star moving, then stop, thought it might be a ufo, but I was having star waverings all night).", "At one point we were laying on the dune, and I felt totally pure, clean, and comfortable.  My mind was an absolute blank.  I didnt have a thought in my head.  I was just lying on a huge dune of sand, absorbing the energies of the stars.  I turned and asked my friend if his mind was just totally clear like mine and he replied with a really mellow 'yea...'. We continued to kick it there, where he confessed some cool out-of-body dreams he had had to me, when suddenly we heard in the distance: 'heMP!'.  ", "I let him finish his dream talk when I proceeded to  bellow out my reply.  The wanderer followed our voices to The Spot (a good thing too, he was heading in the wrong direction).  We went back, met up with the group, and proceeded to drag them to The Spot (which took like half an hour :) ).  Of course they loved it, took off their shoes and walked in the water, tried to catch frogs, etc.  We trudged on to find some huge angles to run/jump down (most of us would fall, but it was worth it).  Mushed around here for a bit, started getting really cold (were off and on cold through the night, movement helped a lot), so most of us proceeded back.  Slowly but surely made it back to the warm fire (which we had thankfully started before we left).  We smoked a bowl or two and got REALLY tired (my lids were already drooping on the walk back).  We found our appropriate spots and went to sleep.", "I left out a lot, as per my hazy memory, and much of it would have to be taken in context.  On the whole it was an incredible trip.  I highly reccomend taking MDMA with a LARGE group of friends.  Each time I trip with these people, I feel we get closer and closer.  I have a piece of every single one of their hearts residing inside me know.  We have tasted each others' energies and loved it.  One of the fun things about a big group trip is that it is inevitable that you will break up into splinter groups, but keep meeting back up in the whole, and get stoked every time :).  And of course, the more hugs you can get in a row, the better :)!!!", "I tried E two times, the first time was GREAT and most of the second one was too, but I think maybe I did them a little to close together, and fear I may have permanent long-term effects.  I took 1 pill during a christmas party and then 2 and 1/2 the day maybe week bfore christmas, maybe a week or two later.  During the second one (the same pills)  I started seeing trails, got cold sweats, got really pale, and thought I was gonna pass out.  Then resumed normal experince.", "Then about 2 weeks afterwards I started getting EXTREEMLY anxious every time I smoked weed.  Now I have horifying panic attacks 3-4 times daily, thinking of suiside sometimes, and wanting to cry but can't.  Whenever I talk about it people get mad at me for saying what what happening, I feel so alone.  I've since given up weed, which I totally blame E for, but the panic attacks still happen, not to the extent that they had though, which I'm glad, but I think I'm gonna have a heart attack every time it does happen.", "I also get very light headed, and sometimes forget to breath.  They happen a lot at night when I'm trying to sleep, and sometimes I wake up and everything's fuzzy.  I'm 20yo and already going gray and balding, I don't think it's from the panic but I'm sure it's not helping.  I'm having an absolutly TERRIBLE experince of the after effects, I URGE you not to try E!!!!STICK TO WEED!!!, it feels good when you do it, but wait a month and the side effects just don't go away.", "I better share this experience with Erowid comrades. I heard some people say it lowers down the immune system in your body, mainly due to its tendency to make you tired, not because of the nature of the drug. However, I guess it may not be correct. I used to be very healthy and I still am. So is my girlfriend. Getting to the point, after E experience, I got so sick and had multiple illness, which is very common among people with poor immune system( just like old folks ).  So, here is my story, and I hope you can figure out whether that is a nasty side of this drug or just elaborate coincident. ", "Having learned its aphrodisiac side from previous experience, my girlfriend and I decided to try this while we have sex. I took half pill (due to my heart discomfort with any kind of stimulant) and she took one pill. As normally it is, after 30 minutes later, it started kicking in, and we both agreed on that this is good shit ; ) ", "Just as any guys with high on the drug, this ex- cheerleader girl looked so erotic and gorgeous then she usually was so I instantly start kissing and taking her shirt off, and ? mum,mum,mum? Despite I had hard time making & maintaining erection because of its side effect, the sex was somewhat between okay and pretty good, but not as we expected (so, we will try foxy methoxy next time). ", "Now, this is the beginning. It was okay at that night. After sex, we just talked and talked and had light dance at the living room. Next morning, I found myself being totally fucked up beyond recognition. I had runny nose, soar throat, headache, sneezing, you name them.  I managed myself to take Tylenol cold but it made things worse. It effected my heart and made me feel very uncomfortable. The flu (presumably?) lasted about seven-fucking- days and now I am still on the effect of it. Making things worse, I just found that I just had a swallowing glands on my upper jaw( massive amount of inflammation stored on near saliva gland and it fuckin? hurts like hell. One day, when I was young, I had to go to the ER because of that). Fortunately, she didn?t get sick after the experience( but we both crashed at end of the trip ! ). ", "Please keep in mind that I was very healthy college dude who spends lots of times in gym and so she was. .  There was no way I got sick because I was very exhausted or something like that, because as I mentioned, I was ?proudly? very healthy and we didn?t even dance that much. In fact, we spent most of the tripping time by talking and sitting on the couch, touching each other in the warm place I never had this kind of sickness in recent days, and back then, I have some flu experience, but these were never intense as one happened this week. ", "Are these just coincident or dreadful effect of the drug? I am not sure since I?m not a doctor.", "I have only rolled four times, but I still thougt it would be beneficial to others for me to share my experiences of 'the day after.'", "Mindset and setting, preparations made for the experience: Each time I rolled, I was at a rave club with my best friend and one or two of her friends.  The first two times I rolled, I made the decision to take ecstasy on the spur of the moment, though I had thought about rolling before and had researched the drug, so my actions were not completely spontaneous and uninformed.  The third and forth times I rolled, I had been planning on going to the club with the intention of rolling.  I only ever rolled if I strongly felt the desire to do so at the time.  One time at the club, I had been planning on rolling, but upon arrival, I did not feel the 'magic' in the air that night and so decided to not do ecstasy that time.", "1st experience--One E pill (fish), almost certainly pure MDMA.  Five hours later, one half E pill (unknown type).  Two hours later, one Adderall pill, one other unknown pharmaceutical pill.  Two hours later, one Adderall pill. ", "2nd experience--One E pill (unknown type, but almost certainly pure MDMA.  I rolled extremely hard and felt all the characteristics of an E trip.)  I had hit a blunt about an hour before I took the pill.", "3rd experience--one E pill (euro), almost certainly pure MDMA.", "4th experience--one E pill (luner, or russian moon).  I felt the MDMA, but I also felt rather smacked out and I wonder if there was something else in the pill, though people I know who took pills from the same batch said they never rolled so hard in their life.  I think the smacked out feeling may have been a result of my best friend having a bad encounter with another friend and unloading her problems on me.", "Experience: Obviously I rolled the hardest the first time, feeling all the effects that are associated with ecstasy: increased empathy, love, unity, and acceptance, a desire to touch and be touched, an overall optomistic view of the world, a desire to talk openly with complete strangers and make new friends, being able to see beauty in everything, etc.  I felt these effects each time, though to a lesser degree with each new experience.  But I do not want to focus on the trip in this report, but on the after effects of the drug.", "Constants: Each time I've rolled, the day after I have felt rather tired and worn down, though not unable to function.  The 'hangover' was little more than a feeling of being tired from a long night out.  However, this worn down feeling is always accompanied by a complete loss of appetite, and though I try to force myself to at least eat a slice of bread, I've never, ever wanted to eat ANYTHING the day after I rolled.  I never really experienced any depression in the days following my E trip, but I have noticed a mild pain in my jaw that lasts 2-3 days afterward from clenching my jaw while I'm rolling.  This is pretty common I think.  I'm back to my perfectly normal self two days after I've rolled.", "Unique to the first experience: The day(s) after the first experience had the qualities listed above, but they also had some additional features that were unique to the first time.  This may have been because it was my first time rolling, or because I took more than one E pill, or because I took other pharmaceuticals, or some combination of the three.  Also, the fact that I did not sleep at all until the night after I rolled (I was awake for at least 36 hours) may have made a difference.  I had a slight headache and slight naseau, and as pointed out, I was very alert and had no desire to sleep, but I suspect that this was from the amphetamine in the Adderall.  What was unique about the days afterward was my difficulty to break away from the dream world I entered on the night of my first roll.  It was an incredible experience and I was reluctant to let it go.  I did not feel depressed, but I did have extreme anxiety for about 5 days after the experience, worrying whether the guy I had met that night would call me or not, etc.  I remebered the events of that night as if they were a dream, an event that had passed long ago, yet it had only happened 1 or 2 days ago.  My sense of time was completely screwed up and it gave me a feeling of loss of control.  Extreme anxiety, a sense of being out of control, and being unable to comprehend time--these characterized the next couple of days after my first roll.  They were not always on my mind--I was able to function and think perfectly well--but they nagged me from the back of my brain.  These negative effects passed after a week though, and they in no way outweighed the wonderfully positive experience of rolling for the first time.", "I hope this helps anyone who is curious about the after effects of ecstasy.  Like I said, I'm not super experienced or anything, but I thought I would share.  I would be curious to know if anyone else has experienced the screwed up time symptom I described.  It was very confusing and a little upsetting!", "When I started taking ecstacy, I would experience the most beautiful and fullfilling things --from the simple, connecting conversations with strangers, to expanding my already incredible relationship with my husband of 6 years. ", "But, the very first time, I entered a nearly debilitating 2 month depression afterward --the massive serotonin dump was total, leaving me with little ability to cope with life in general. I am back to fully functioning, and I would even say that the extended Dark Period helped me to confront things inside myself--making me an even better person. (Dose: 1 pill/tablet MDMA *small, smooth, unprinted pure white tablet, high quality cannabis on the back end. Had a great 'tour guide' who supported me and was always there for me and my safety/health.", "Last night was an all-together different experience; instead of taking it in a small group with a positive, 'controlled' environment, we were at a party of 250+ people. I hadn't done E in over 3 months, and was looking forward to whatever the experience offered me. Generally, E makes me 'more' of what I already am naturally, so I am very comfortable with the Experiences I have had.", "This party was 50% people in their 30's, the other 50% were under 22 years old. I mention it because it was interesting how the two age groups stayed separated, even with the E-mpathy.", "First, the E was delivered 3 hours late....and I was frightened how many people weren't waiting for the E they talked about taking, instead proceeding to drink a great deal of beer/cocktails, smoke pot, do meth, etc. I chose to wait for the E, drinking only orange juice and water, even refraining from cigarettes. I hadn't eaten in about 6 hours, but was feeling great. Bottom line on this Trip: onset varied from 35-50 minutes, Roll lasted 3.5-4 hours, back end 'speed' lasted nearly a day, with small E-like surges throughout the day.", "My preparations for the evening were (two weeks prior to Rolling); reading the books '5-htp' and 'Mind Boosters' (both by Ray Sahelian, M.D.), and doing as much research on E and all its permutations, effects... I started a daily program of 5-htp in the morning, with Gingko Biloba or St. John's Wort, followed by 5-htp and Valerian at night before bed. ", "Not only is 5-htp an OTC-available precursor to serotonin production, it also helped add 2-3 hours of deep, quality sleep to my (usual) 4 hours of sleep, increased my mental acuity and emotional stability, it even helped curb my sometimes overly ambitious appetite. This is a supplement that should be taken only by people who read these books, not for people prone to mindless pill-popping. Also, it can affect SSRI's and MAO-inhibitors, so be INFORMED before you take it. ", "I took one pill/tablet, and within 30-45 minutes felt the first glow of the Rush. This was slower, more subtle than the other E I had had, and to some extent I was spending more of that time trying to help people who had been drinking and taking E, and helping lonely 1st timers who had no idea what to expect/do to enjoy their Roll. I was saddened that many people there had NO CLUE how E works, why it does what it does, and what mixing their drugs might do to the Experience. A small group of us was concerned about what first aid emergencies might crop up because of this, and kept aware of those people. Luckily, nothing awful happened to them. Equally disturbing was the number of people taking *2* pills, and they didn't even test them first. From what I have heard, one DXM pill is enough, much less two! and no one here knew for sure what these pills contained. A large percentage of Rollers were 1st timers who were scared, and a little frantic. I was all about Respecting how they wanted to roll, but I was really concerned for them, and it almost hurt me to watch them do this (unwittingly? uncaringly?) to themselves.", "I continued enjoying my Rush, I was elated and had an incredible mental acuity throughout the experience. I did notice this E had more of a speed-y character to it than other batches. Still, I loved touching and feeling, being touched and felt (sometimes in sensual/sexual ways; feeling up and being felt-up), dancing...I was even reveling in my clean sweat from the initial Rush. I was all about Giving and Caring, and had some incredible opportunities to indulge in my bisexuality, with and without my husband. (We have an incredible Connection, and have been 'threesoming' for a while now...) I was in love with women's feet, and one woman had her shoes off, her boyfriend was rubbing one foot, so I sat down next to them, smiling and Loving. They invited me into their experience, and there we sat on the couch, rubbing her feet....she was so Blissed. I am a massage therapist, and quickly became popular *grin*. I remember looking into her eyes as I brought her foot up to my mouth and gently, languidly ran my tongue along her arch, sucking her big toe, we looked INTO each other as my satin-gloved hand slowly massaged up her ankle to her knee and inner thigh. She was definitely into all the attention, and I was just glad that we offered each other something unique and pleasurable. ", "I was having so much fun talking and listening, touching and feeling, and I realized that my Roll was all about unconditional acceptance, and open appreciation, of people I interacted meaningfully with. This was different from other E-trips, which were more sensually selfish. My husband did not take Viagra with the E this time, he took it later, when we got home. We decided to leave when we realized the Roll was down-plateauing, but still viable. We grabbed a cab, and came home to our satin sheets and fur throws (prepared special for the evening), and continued drinking water.", "We had mind-blowing sex, and door-opening connection with each other, and then settled in to talk into the morning hours. When I realized I was not Rolling any longer, I felt that I had a choice; either let the Crash ruin me like it had the first time, or Move Through It, positively. I chose doing it Positively, and felt a surge of Self Empowerment. I also knew I was coming into the back end speediness, so I ate some wonderful cannabis-butter chocolate truffles. We talked and shared and petted each other in the most loving, giving, receptive way. That quiet, connecting touching really seemed to last forever...A few hours later (7am) we went to sleep, but only for about 3 hours. We spent the rest of the day in bed, talking, watching movies, relaxing.", "I highly recommend 5-HTP supplements, and paying close attention to general health for at least 2 weeks before Rolling, and probably even 2 weeks afterward. Read all you can about E, and really listen to your body while you are on it. Also, TEST TEST TEST those pills/tablets, before taking them!!! ", "I love E, and will continue to do it, as long as I adequately prepare my mind and body for the load.", "here's a little bit of background that pertains to my tale... my dabbling in perception altering substances have been few & rather far between, consisting of 6 MDMA experiences & one rather unsettling LSD trip.  i drink & smoke weed when the occasion permits, but not @ levels that seriously alter my reality.  the main thing to bear in mind, dear reader, is that prior to the story that is about to unfold, i was a very depressed individual.  i suffered from severe self esteem problems mostly centering around poor body image, & it had been interfering in my daily life for many years.  w/ the aid of this wonderful empathogen, i was able to permanently change the way i perceive myself & the world, & consequently have been far happier in my life since this occurred.   read on...", "one night i had the wonderful good luck to run across 2 capsules of pure MDMA- 135 milligrams a piece of the good stuff, straight from the chemist, not cut w/ speed or anything else the way your average tablet of street E is.  the two friends (D & J)i was w/ that night decided that it would be a good time for them to roll for the first time (D had a capsule of the same stuff i did, & J had a tablet of street E that was known to be strong but speedy) i agreed to roll w/ them, & sort of babysit them through the experience.  in the past i'd never needed to take more than one tablet of E (approx. 125mgs of MDMA) to really feel it, so i thought that one of these capsules would work just fine.  i passed out a multivitamin to my trip companions because i've found the magnesium in them stops jaw clench & eye jitters, & the vitamin C is good for you =)  i took 400mg of advil for a headache, but i doubt that impacted my experience @ all.", "9:30pm- down the hatch!  we all down our respective pills w/ a grin & set off for a friend's house to relax & wait for them to hit.", "10:00- J's E hits him suddenly, rocketing him to the peak almost instantly... his eyes are jittering around from the speediness of his tablet, but he's in heaven playing w/ ice cubes & hugging.", "10:30- D & i are ~barely~ feeling the twinges of the come on, but he's feeling it more than i am", "10:45- D beginning to come up noticeably, i'm still not really feeling it, & grow suspicious; was i cheated by the dealer?  its NEVER taken this long for MDMA to affect me before!", "11:00- i lose my patience & take the second capsule, wanting to be @ the same level as my companions.

It was about my fifth or sixth time. I always enjoyed the experience once it started, but it always started in such a way as it felt exacly the same as the panic attacks I'm prone to. After the last use of MDMA I had mild depression for weeks afterward. I always wanted to go and take the drug to make the feelings go away, but knew it would be pointless as it would only last a few hours. Anyway, the feelings of hangover (I would get really achey due to usually dancing four or five hours straight), tired, and headachey. These feelings seemed to get worse after each time I did the drug, and by 1999 the bad outweighed the good and there was no reason to go on with it. Also, I was afraid that since I do have a bit of an addictive personality, which so far has only manifested itself in the over-consumption of food, I was worried about chronically chasing after a feeling.", "But I am happy I did it.

If we were at a rave, it was always dark with loud music (of course) and we spent most of our time walking around talking to people, or dancing (spent little time in the well lit areas, or just sitting).  If we were at home, we were usually in a spacious room, dimly lit (blacklights or glowsticks only) with house or ambient techno music playing in the background, but not too loud. ", "MINDSET:  We almost always made sure our mindset was that of being happy and jovial and in a generally good mood, or we would not take the pills to start with (we were under the impression that if you were in an ill mood it would decrease the euphoric effects).  ", "PREPARATIONS:  As far as preparations for the experience, we made sure we drank plenty of water, and were well rested prior to taking the drug, and we oftentimes ingested 1 or 2 vitamin C pills (we were told that helped increase the peak time) about an hour before taking the drug.", "DOSAGE:  As for dosage, I couldn't tell you in milligrams or anything very specific, but rarely did we take more than 1 or 2 pills (1 for me, 2 for my friend, who was more of a frequent ecstacy user, and who hated the come down more than I did).  ", "TIMING:  We experimented with taking our pill early in the night (11pm), all the way to taking it late (3am), and our general consensus was that the earlier we took it, the sooner it wore off of course, and so the greater the temptation to take another was.  After many raves I've decided that it's best to spend some time loosening up by dancing or walking around first, while you are sober, and to wait and take your pill until you have 'explored' the venue well enough and have danced for a while.  When I took my pill too early, I'd come down halfway through the party, and then I'd find I had a hard time enjoying the rest of the party, as it was nowhere near as 'euphoric' as the first half had been while I was on the drug.  Generally, I plan on the pill lasting 4 hours, and I plan to take it so that I come down right as the night would be ending, be it at someone's house, or at a rave.", "WHAT I LEARNED FROM THE EXPERIENCE:  I learned that like most drugs, you can build a tolerance to ecstacy very quickly.  This only means more money you must spend to reach the level of pleasure you are seeking, and more harm to your body, and more exhaustion and hangover in the following days.  I find that any more than once a month seems too often, as it takes at least that long to let my body tolerance settle down some, and I don't think I have ever felt as good as I did the very first time, off the same dosage anyway.  I think the ecstacy experience varies widely with how clean the pills are, or if they are dirty, what other drugs they are cut with, and mindset.  If I spend too much time worrying about how hard the drug is or isn't hitting me, then I ruin it's effects.  I think the best thing you can do is limit the frequency and dose (try for only 1 or 2 pills, no more than once a month), and don't depend on the effects of the drug for a good time, but rather, just let them enhance your experience.", "OTHER SUPPLEMENTS:  I was never on any form of medication, be it over the counter, or prescription, at the times I did this drug.", "Dose taken orally in early evening, gellcapped powder.   No real effects for nearly thirty minutes, then mild nausea, followed by onset.  It felt like the duration from onset to plataeu was only about 10 minutes.   The experience was, as one might expect, very mild.   I was a little tired when I took it and would agree with previous reports that, despite it's energizing effects, MDMA doesn't 'wake you up' the way caffeine does.  Rather, I would describe it as letting you ignore your fatigue.   ", "As the trip started hitting in earnest I felt light, as though my body were becoming simply an extension of my will.   Movement was effortless and almost unconcious.   I felt a little tense at first, this being my first try on MDMA, but I told myself 'just let it go...' and soon felt completely at ease.  There was no real euphoria, just a general sense of contentment and well-being.   I spent the first hour of the trip walking outside, feeling just a little high.  I semi-unconciously shook my hands back and forth, not out of nervous energy so much as a sense of being well rested and bored. No obvious sensory enhancement.  The rest of the experience was spent indoors with a friend.  I felt an impulse to clench my teeth, but the impulse was minor and infrequent enough that I could easily control it. ", "  There was only a very minor increase in pulse and no measureable increase in body temp.  I felt unusually sociable and had an urge to communicate and express myself, but again, the effect wasn't overpowering--just a modest modification of normal behavior.  The general mild sensory enhancement of the MDMA began to be apparent about two hours in...I took a piss and found the experience oddly mildly interesting, as though I had never really stopped to notice the sensation before.    At one point I noticed a very faint 'glowing' effect to lights, including very short tracers.  Hardly even noticeable.   Bright and unusual colors seemed more compelling--I found myself particularly drawn to things with high visual contrast.   Music sounded more interesting, and food tasted better.    I had heard about MDMA keeping the iron out of your sword, so I pulled out some of my favorite porn as an experiment.   My reaction was pretty much mild amusement to the material...a sense that something SHOULD be happening, but no real arousal.  And that was just fine.   ", "The trip ended so gently and quietly that I could hardly tell you when it happened...I just started feeling tired again and noticed the pupil dilation had gone down.   In the days following, I realize that I really feel a bit better about myself, more able to let go of unpleasent things in the past.   A nice, curious drug.   I'll definately try a higher dose next time, but the low dose was a perfectly nice experience by itself, and so tame that you could trip anywhere and nobody would know the difference in your behavior (although the pupil dilation is a big giveaway.)", "I am usually the type of guy that gets nervous and worried when I try new things. I generally get scared and second guess everything I do. Once I took ecstacy, all worries and fear diminished, all stress and pain was eliminated, and this is where my story begins.", "A friend and I were hearing a lot about ecstacy at our school that year, how everyone has tried it and how everyone loves it, but you know me I turned it down several times before my encounter with complete bliss.", "Now I have smoked weed before, I didn't like it, it felt too much like a dream and I acted too spacy and I never laughed my head off like everyone else seemed to do. Weed just wasn't my thing, I have quit alcohol for various reasons. So at the time, I was not into any type of substance. I get straight a's and I have a girlfriend, I read books and I love to have fun with my friends. I am your respectable average middle class income kid. ", "When people told me about their experiances with ecstacy I thought nothing of it and went on about my daily life. Until my best friend tried it with others one day, I was shocked that he would do such a thing, and terrified. But he changed my mind with his persuasive skills he always seems to bring about right when I am vulnerable and non-skeptical. So we sat home one day, it was a friday of our spring break and he slid a glass of water that he spent time preparing for me. I said to him 'are you sure this won't mess me up too bad?' and he replied by saying 'oh no way, I have done it 4 times now and I'm better than I have ever been before!' So I said alright and I quickly chugged the water down containing the exact measurement of 82 mg of ecsatcy. After a few minutes it felt like a marijuana buzz and I didn't like it at all, infact I hated it and I just wanted it to be over with. ", "After about half and hour my mind tripped, everything in my vision got wide and it flobbelled back exactly how it did on The Matrix in the hallway near the end of the show. Anyways, yes everything went hazzy on me for a second, then I quickly regained control. It wasn't like weed, it was different, an unexplainable rush to my brain triggered every nerve in my body to thrust to my friend and grasp him in the tightest and most affectionate hug I have ever experienced. How I felt was so miraculous and joyful that I let the dogs inside, which I never do. I let the dogs up and i sat there and scatched and petted them, their fur felt so delicate and tingly that it caused me to have this sudden urge to feel so innocent and pure, I was born-again and no mistake plagued me because I was trapped in the halls of bliss that I could not recognize anything wrong at the time. I then shouted 'It's all good!' a few times as I laid on the floor next to the pets that I have been petting. The very sense of the carpet just corressing my back was enough to put a huge smile on my face let alone all the intricate details of the time. ", "I called up my girlfriend, and I said that i would be coming over in a few minutes, she said for me to come in an hour because she had to take a shower because she was out tanning. So as that hour past, I was on top of the world just watching t.v. feeling a sense of connection with a girl every channel I turned it to. An hour past and I dropped off my friend at his house then I drove to my girlfriend's house. As soon as I arrived she was out on her porch and I ran to her and gave her the biggest hug and such a passionate kiss because I felt motivated from all the girls I fell in love with on t.v. So as I did this her friend that was over there goes 'awww' like that but neither one of them had the slightest clue that I am high on ecstacy. The feeling of warmth and sensations of touch kept rushing to my brain as we held hands on her porch. They had their music on inside and as I heard the music I could feel something click, I made a connection with Aaliya that day and I still have feelings for her to this day. The day grew long and I still felt as good as ever. My vision was distorted in that the rooftops across the street shined bright with reflections of the hot sun, the very sight of it made me drink glasses upon glasses of water. ", "My high was coming down and I was nearly straight, but then my girlfriend started talking about where we are going with our relationship. She gave her thoughts as to what she wanted and what we are going through. When she was done I began my soapbox, I was so in touch with my thoughts things came out that I never knew before hand. I came around to defining what a relationship is and why we have relationships and what I wanted in ours. It's as if my deepest thoughts were rescued by little ecstacy guys and they came out of my mouth like it was a water slide, just shooting ideas and perspectives on issues in our relationship. I found it easy to express myself, maybe because I was immune to the world around me as I spoke, I just completely drowned out everything and put total concentration onto this topic. She was throroughly impressed and recommended that we talk more about problems facing us. By the time her mom was about to come home, I was down again and normal, I still felt a little funny but I acted straight. She came home and I greeted her with a hello and how was your day? We had a true friendly conversation and I have been like that ever since, I still second guess lots of things but for the most part my expericance is not regreted. My advice, if you think you have social problems and/or trouble expressing inner thoughts, take this once and you will be positively changed.", "I have taken x probly around 200 or 300 pills. It was great for a while but then all of a sudden they started knocking me out like a valium. Around 1 hour after I take it I have this urge to just sleep. I can only accomplish staying awake if I mix coke with it. I have stopped doing X all together because of this. In our little group of people that we hang around with I seem to be the only one affected like this.", "Yesterday my mate and I decided to use MDMA. The dose was 110mg each. I weigh 128kg, she weighs 86kg.", "By 7:45pm we were 'feeling' it. We went for a walk. We walked over to the school that I live near (its an elementary school, K-6). They have a garden, and we looked at all the wonderful flowers they have including some bizarre poppies and my favorite, gladiolas.", "We found ourselves on the swings shortly after that and enjoyed ourselves immensely. We both sort of hurt our ankles dismounting. Walking around I encountered some wonderful nostalgia -- I looked at trees that were nothing but saplings when I attended the school.", "I normally wear sandals and I indulged in a barefoot walk through the sandbox, and we remembered past trips on various other substances (namely LSD and DXM) at the same site. Mostly they were at night and it was very refreshing to be there during the day --  we didnt get that sneaky eeling.", "Soon after arriving back at home (we walked of course), she said she was peaking. I thought that I would be peaking soon too, so we laid down in bed and just touched eachother and made repeated 'i love you''s. The peak wore down in 1/2hr to 3/4hr. I suggested we go to the hot tub. Ive had some real lower back problems, and my doctor had recommended a Jacuzzi.", "So we got down there and I was overcome by an urge to go swimming. It was WONDERFUL. Ive never had the oppurtunity to swim on E before, but it is just beyond words. Wow. We then got in the spa and just hugged and kissed and thoroughly enjoyed eachothers company.", "Its unreal how close we felt. It was as if ... well its even hard to put it into words. We are normally very close and like to be nose-to-nose when possible... but the way we felt was something a little more. We hugged little closer and laughed a little longer, and so on. Complete elation.", "After about 1/2hr, we tired of the spa, and were getting worn out by the hot water and chlorine fumes. We made it back to the house and watched a little tv, letting the e wear off a little as it had been a little too strong.", "She got it in her head to go to the beach. Now, i dont know how many of you live near the beach. But here in southern california, the days are  retty warm right now so the plankton, etc, in the water are multiplying. This makes nights spectacular as the waves GLOW. They were INCREDIBLY light. The most beautiful thing I think we've ever seen. The waves just lit up like neon lights. She was completely taken by it. We took a walk barefoot down the beach. She was jumping up and down, watching the sand under her light up when she touched it. The water and the sand between my toes was fantastic.", "The walk was about a mile. When we got back to the car, she had gotten hungry (I had been grazing on poundcake, so I wasnt particularly  ungry). Around here, most places are closed by 12am, so we wound up going to the supermarket which is now open 24hrs. She couldnt decide what she wanted so we wandered aimlessly for a bit.", "Im a gardener at heart and by nature (no pun intended). I walked over to the florist section. We were both awestruck by the colors and smells and the /purity/ of the scene. We went from flower to flower, smelling and touching and just bursting with happiness and just incredible good feelings. Im growing gladiolas and some red morning glories and other plants. it felt so good to see other plants that were babied as much as mine. We were just completely taken by it.", "Anyhow, we managed to pry ourselves away from the flowers in search of nourishment and procured a fresh (at midnight?!) fruit salad. We also bought some rolls. The fruit was delicious. The rolls were equally good.", "The rest of the night mainly consisted of us coming home and remarking about how incredible our evening had been.", "We have a good time together. We can have a great time together WITHOUT mdma. But last night was special. Last night was one of the most spiritual, happy nights of my life. I cant believe how incredibly happy I was.", "Normally we are e-ravers. We use e at raves. The music and the people potentiate it. But we feel like E showed us its true colors last night and we're not sure we will ever use it at a rave again. I really think that E is a wonderful AID. A HELPER. Without the prior relationship, we wouldn't have felt as in love as we did. I think everyone should be able to use this drug.", "hehe and oh yeah. In case you didnt notice it by now, it has a wonderful afterglow that I am basking in, 28hrs later.", "The world can be a wonderful place...... youve just got to catch nature doing her thing.

(yes, even though sometimes its easier just to hate them -- E is helping me realize things like this)", "i first tried ecstasy at a friends party in May of 2000, and i had the best time of my life. When the X started kicking in, we smoked some cannabis, so the full effects of the X were cloudy. I didnt seem to notice that things were more 'beautiful' as people say, but the touch and hearing senses were greatly magnified. the total peak effects were about 3 1/2 hrs, then the come down. The next day, i didnt have the mdma hangover, but i did obssessivly want to do it again. in about a week the want for X had diminished, but i did want to do it again. ", "I recently rolled X again at a L.A. rave, but this time i didnt smoke cannabis, and its a total different experience! Nothing was clouded, everything was 'beautiful' every person who walked by was beautiful, every light, the music, everything. The experience wasnt as long as the first one (peak effects lasting around 3 hrs, probably due to dosage, and purity), but the experience was extremely better. the problem was, i had the mdma hangover the second time around. the day after i was ok, but the second day after, was the most depressing day ever. i was crying all day, most of it was over nothing. when i did have a reason to cry, it was because i wanted to do X again. Even though the after effects are sometimes harsh (depression etc..), X is still my drug of choice.", "I've been doing MDMA for 21 years, I guess.

E fit right into that.", "I had a 5 year hiatus on E, ending maybe 7 years ago. It was too difficult to deal with the second day through fifth day crash.

Then, next thing I know, I look at the clock and it's 4am.  I ask my girl what happened, where the time went.  She starts to tell me exactly what has been happening.  Apparently, I was there, awake and talking to her, mixing two conversations.  I'd start talking about a camera and blend fishing into the sentence.  It was freaking her out, and she didn't know what to do.  So she just let me keep talking.  She also told me that we danced, went out to the car, and took pictures and talked about many things.  NONE of this is in my brain.  Who was she talking to?  It wasn't me.  Sure it was me, but I have absolutely no recollection until I 'came back' at 4am.  Now, I feel as though I was robbed of 3 hours of my life.", "That was the first time it happened.  I thought it was a fluke, but it happened again two weeks ago, and I'm never going to touch it again because of what happened.", "This time, not only was my girl there, but also a couple of my friends, too.  This time, I 'lost time' at about midnight, and the next thing I remember is waking up in the morning of the next day.  Then they began to tell me what happened the night before.  They said that I was TOTALLY INSANE.  As one would approach me with a pool stick (we were shooting pool), I apparently said to him, 'Nice fishing rod.'  And then on and on, I would talk about fishing all night, they said.  At one point, they said I yelled at one of them, saying to him, 'Your pole's hittin'.  That's a fish, go set the hook!'.  And then they started having fun with, my girl would say, 'How big is your fish?'  and I would reply, telling her it's 4 pounds or whatever.  These people talked to me while I was in this state.  I was obviously hallucinating and was 'temporarily insane'.  One of my friends became very scared, because I have guns and I am capable of serious hell if need be.  And now that I think about it, what if I woke up to find all these people dead, by my gun?  I'd have no memory of it, but what if I could have done something like that?", "Would that be the exact definition of 'temporary instanity', and would I be innocent of murder?", "Having had a wonderful trip about two weeks previously, my partner and I decided to finish off our supply (around 150mg each, but actual dosage uncertain due to distance from supplier) at a dance party being thrown for an art opening.", "The party turned out to be something of a downer itself -- not too many people we knew and way too many of, well, the sort of people who would go to an art opening with a DJ and call it a 'rave' in all seriousness.  But we figured we'd do the e anyways and at least enjoy the dancing.", "About an hour after dosing, the only real obvious effects were a feeling of alienation, and mild paranoia, along with the beginnings of a headache.

By the time we arrived back home, I was feeling vaguely nauseated and my partner moreso.", "At home, we attempted to lay down and relax a bit, but by this time we were both extremely uncomfortable with stomach cramps, jaw clenching, and a headache that was approaching migraine intensity.  My partner eventually vomited a few times, and I considered it but decided it would probably only make a bad trip nightmarish.  The next few hours were spent semirigid on our bed, trying to breath my way through muscle spasms and concentrate on not chewing my lips, tongue and cheeks bloody, with only minor success on both counts.  We finally passed into a fitful sleep sometime around 8am, and woke up around 1pm feeling miserably hung over and not at all happy.", "All in all, an utter waste of both a weekend and some expensive pharmaceuticals.  I had no interest in bothering with MDMA for quite some time after that: it was close to a year and a half later before I tried it again.", "Subsequent experimentation has led me to two conclusions: One, that I'm not at all the sort of person who likes to do drugs around lots of strangers; and two, that an eight to twelve week spacer between MDMA ingestions seems to be a bare minimum for my body to recover adequately.

This scared me cause it seems like addictive behavior.

I now take 10-12 pills per trip, taking 2-3 pills at once every 2 hrs.  Thats pretty bad.  I feel like my brain is totally gone. Im suprised that im not a complete moron by now.  I entered myself into rehab because i didnt want to overdose on the stuff.  I dont know anyone that drops as much and as often as i do.  after the first 3 pills i take i dont even feel anything! my heart doesnt even pump that much faster than it ususally does.  I think that my heart had adapted to the amphetamine in the E.  Im so afraid that i will overdose some day because the E doesnt even work anymore.  I find that im not depressed, but its alot easier to get angry or sad.  It is defanetly alot more easy to cry about something.

This was a big deal for all of us and it was something special because none of us had tried it before, although we kept hearing great things from other people about it. We were planning to all dose for the millennium New Year's Eve and were talking big about universal love, peace, etc. You know how it goes. It seemed to be the ideal 'party favor'. ", "About a week before the big day a male friend of mine and I were kicking around in my apartment, both vaugely bored. We both agreed to sample it ahead of time to make sure it would be worth it (taking it for New Year's). So we parked the pills in front of us on the desk and read up on the effects and warnings about it here (Thanks so much for making this resource available! I firmly believe that my lack of serious problems with recreational drugs and my immense SAFE enjoyment of them is a direct result to my having access to unbiased information on the 'Net). Anyway, we decided we were both OK with this and dosed around 9:30 PM. They were gelcaps, very similar looking to the herbal vitamins I take, not tablets like I had read about on here and ecstacy.org. We had just eaten dinner about a half-hour before dosing, and had a few bong hits as well, and for the next hour or so we both zoned out on the TV. I started feeling vaguely speedy but dozy as well, and my male friend was to tally into a Nature special on glaciers. I closed my eyes because it seemed a good thing to do, and started wondering if the caps had been bunk, and thought, damn, I hope this wasn't a rip off, that was a lot of money for herbal speed, etc.", "The Nature special finally ended and there wasn't anything else on the TV at the time (this was now T+1.30 after dosing) so I flipped the TV off. I was feeling cold and had covered up in a blanket on my bed. Then something happened. We both started talking. I warmed up and threw off my blanket, and sat down on the floor by my friend, and we started to really open up to each other. The empathy was amazing. I had heard that this was a 'hug drug' and I was worried that we'd both start pawing each other. I'm a lesbian and didn't feel any sexual attraction to my male friend, and I didn't want to get into a situation that I would be embarassed about later, but there wasn't any of that. We just related to each other as human beings, who both had problems and hang-ups and worries, and I began to feel the strongest form of platonic love I'd ever experienced for another person. We covered nearly every topic you can imagine; after analyzing each other we started in on all of our friends. We told each other hurts and wounds we'd suffered throughout our life. We told each other problems we had with each other in an atmosphere of complete openness and lack of worries and no 'I know this is going to sound mean, but...'. You know? No disclaimers. It was totally understood that we were speaking from the heart and had absolutely no malice, no manipulation.", "Around 4:00 AM (T+7.30) we both started feeling drowsy and started losing the connection with each other. It was kind of depressing. I wanted to keep talking all night. I was fascinated with everything he had to say. I had 7 caps left and I was tempted to take another to keep the bliss going. But a few years back I almost developed a problem with dependence on meth and I recognized the crash when I felt it. We said goodbye to each other, he went home, and I kept telling myself to be happy with what I got. I tried to go to sleep and had the same kind of crunchy edginess that I remember from coming off an LSD trip. I tossed and turned and eventually fell asleep about an hour later. I slept long and hard and woke up the next day with a strange mixture of mild depression and gentle euphoria. It was like I could see other people, strangers, as just human beings. But I knew that I was just as fallable as the rest of them, and for a person who doesn't consider herself to have a big ego, this was kind of depressing. ", "If you are thinking about taking this, I would recommend it highly. It's much more subtle than LSD or even MJ, and you might think that it's not happening. Make sure that you trust the person/people you're around, because you're going to want to open up to them. Turn off the TV because whenever there's a TV around (or a computer) everyone seems to focus on it instead of each other, and you'll miss the fun of it. A TV doesn't feel back at you. I can see how it would be very useful for getting up the guts to talk to strangers in a bar, or if you have a beef with someone else in your life, if you both take it you probably have a good chance to work it out. I can totally see how counselors and therapists would find it useful to take to relate to thier patients. I didn't get a chance to dance or move around much, but I think it would be fun to go to a club or a rave the next time around. ", "So, I don't know if this was *real* X or 'that crunchy herbal raver shit', but I trust the judgement of the person I got it from, and it was a worthwhile experience for me. For New Year's I think I'm going to take a low dose of LSD along with it (it's called 'candyflipping'). I hope everyone who wants to try it gets the opportunity, and I still can't believe a drug that allows this kind of love and empathy to come out in people can ever be considered 'evil' or 'dangerous'. More people, I think, should take it. But then, that's just my opinion :-)", "It was the last Saturday of my freshman year of college, and I was determined to finish with a spectacular experience to keep me going through a summer of exile in the Midwest.  I had eaten about an eighth of mushrooms the night before, and my brain was feeling pretty kicked around, but my friend (and faithful dealer) B had scored some mind-blowing E, so I decided to go for it.  The pills had tested marvelously (straight to black w/ the Dancesafe kit), so I bought two to bring to a party on campus.  My good friend A was spinning that night at 1:30, so I dropped the first pill (a blue dolphin) around midnight to be peaking for his set.  ", "But 10 minutes before A's set, I hadn't even begun to come up yet. *Tragic*!  I went back to my dorm room to get the second pill, which I had been planning to take in halves.  But...one half was so much bigger than the other I decided to just go for it and take the whole thing.  I downed it with orange juice and high-tailed it back to the party just in time for A's set.  The place was pounding with really tight progressive beats, and I immediately went to the middle of the dance floor.  After about 10 minutes of hardcore dancing, I started to feel that incredible tingle, and I knew I was in for a hell of a ride.  It was more intense than any pill I'd ever taken.  I felt the serotonin rushing in waves over my brain, and the music coursed through me with the rhythm of good poetry and the sweetness of honey.  My friend D (who, in that particular instant, was my best, truest, most wonderful friend in the whole wide world) had glowsticks, and even when I'm not rolling he blows my mind.  That night, through his lightshow, I was transported to a different universe, surrounded, accepted, and loved by pure crystalline creatures of rarefied light.  It was amazing.  I gave him a *huge* hug as he went off back to the dancefloor.  I was definitely feeling the urge to move, so I headed in that direction as well.  I got there just in time to hear Delerium: Silence (one of my favorite songs), and it almost put me over the edge.  Darude: Sandstorm came on, and I was gone.  I was rushing so hard I couldn't dance, couldn't talk, couldn't care about anything but how incredible I felt.  I felt my shirt, my pants, my hair - everything was beyond description.  I picked up a sweatshirt that was laying on a chair, and curled up with it on a couch.  I stayed there for like, half an hour, feeling utterly at peace.  Waves of contentment washed over me - I had never felt as wonderful, happy, and peaceful as I did in that half hour.  ", "I was brought back to reality by the owner of the sweatshirt (also rolling!), so I relinquished it.  I looked up and realized that the party was basically over - there were a few coked up people still dancing, but most everyone else was gone.  I wandered outside, and somewhere (I don't remember where) I ran into a guy who I only sort of knew, but had long had a crush on.  J (also rolling!) and I went to my room, put on some great jazz, and sat under my roommate's down comforter and talked and cuddled for an hour or so, until E (my roommate) came home.  She was exhausted and wanted her blanket back, so he and I (still rolling *hard core*) took some of my soft stuff and rolling toys and headed across campus to his apartment.  ", "The rest of the night (and most of the morning) was a prolonged conversation of incredible scope and depth.  We talked about everything - family, relationships, our feelings for eachother (apparently I wasn't the only one with a crush!) - until 6am.  Then we fell asleep, cradled in eachother's arms, utterly content and at peace.  Even now, if I have trouble sleeping, I imagine being cradled in his arms and I'm soon carried away.", "This was easily the best roll I'd ever had - I got to do everything that I love to do while rolling, and I can't imagine it ever being topped.", "I have been a long time user of MDMA and never really experienced any negative side effects, well the noramal fuzzy head and what not but no emotional drain.  My last experience with mdma was quite different though.  I took three pills of pure unpressed mdma over a 6-8 hour span. I rolled possibly the hardest I have ever rolled in my life, if not the hardest at least in the top 3 times.  The odd part is that the next day I felt tired and run down, not out of the ordinary.  Two days after the experience my emotions started to peak and valley.  In a wierd very uncomfortable way.  ", "I found myself experiencing waves of anxiety dealing with situations that a day previous I had been completly comfortable with.  I felt very unloved and removed from my girlfriend.  Also I recieved a phone call from my parents and it nearly brought me to tears.  The closest way I can explain this feeling was having a itch on your brain but not having anyway to make it better.  Nothing I did seem to make me happy. Also I questioned everything that I thought was solid in my life.  I freaked out about some really trivial things and couldn't figure out why.  I have been taking 5-htp and meditating to try and ward off these negative feelings.", "I obtained 2 tabs of X from a friend at work with the intent of trying it over Christmas Break with my girlfriend (G). We had a bit of a rough week and the tabs were forgotten about and lay in a drawer for 5 months. In May 2001 we went on a camping trip to Mexico and I brought them along just in case the mood struck us. The trip went very well and we spent several days camped out on the beach next to the Sea of Cortez. ", "After a delicious dinner of fresh-caught fish, we decided to give it a try. Readying camp so that we could go straight to bed if so desired, we took the tabs with a bottle of water and sat down to a game of cards. This would be the first time for both of us. As soon as we started playing, a fisherman came wandering down the beach and wanted to talk. We chatted for a moment and I noticed G was getting a bit uneasy and I encouraged the fisherman to be on his way. It had been about 25 minutes since we took the tabs. She asked me if I was feeling anything, I wasnt. When the fisherman left, I asked G what she was feeling. She said that she couldnt concentrate and was feeling closed in, a little nauseated, and about to have a panic attack for the past 10 minutes. I had had a couple of beers with dinner and suspect that it had been delaying my sensitivity to the X, but G was feeling powerful effects. I suggested that we take a walk. ", "As soon as she sood up from the card game, she gasped and was staring out over the bay. 'Look at all the stars!, Everything is so bright!' By this time, I was beginning to feel slightly inebriated but without any of the stupor that comes along with alcohol. I was becoming giddy and felt kind of like a floppy hat. I looked out over the ocean and was amazed at the clarity and crispness of my vision! My eyes are not that good, but every single star in the sky shone bright and clear, with none of the fuzziness I had been accustomed to.  The rising full moon reflected off the shimmering ocean and was surrounded by a dazzling kaleidoscope of color!  A grin spread across my face that literally would not leave me for 2 days. G was feeling 10000% better, we later decided that focusing on the card game and trying to speak spanish to the fisherman didnt allow her to open up to the X and caused her previous discomfort.  ", "We hugged, kissed, and felt some of the strongest sexual desires for eachother that we had ever encountered. We were both hyper-aroused and the feelings and sensations when we held each other and kissed were incredible. We both got a most profound impression however that we must go on our walk first, so down the beach we went. The visual euphoria was soon engulfed by an incredibly deep sensation of love, peace, and joy. Not just love for each other, but love for ourselves. I found myself walking taller with my head high, chest out, and shoulders back. I unbuttoned my Hawaiian shirt and felt the breeze caressing my body. I realized that I loved my body, and I didnt have the 'gut' that I had always envisioned on my stomach. The horrible self image that had festered in my mind for the past 15 years was lifted.  The hatred I had felt for my self and the depression that had been dragging me down for two decades was entirely gone! I began to realize the true me that had been crammed and locked into a back recess of my mind.  The demons that had been inhabiting my body and suffocating my soul were gone! As of this writing, they are still gone!  ", "G and I amused each other by trying to force my shoulders and posture down into the position that I had held for so many years. It was the most unnatural and impossible pose! I was FREE! G tells me about the glow on my face, and the sparkle in my eyes. The person that had always been hidden inside me and that she had fallen in love with was now the person in control of my body. G had similar though less profound changes occur. Most notably the feeling of inexplicable freedom and joy and the strengthened love between us. We saw each other at our highest best and ourselves as we really were, not as we had thought or imagined we were.  ", "We spent the next 4 hours walking the beach, doing handstands in the sand and talking more openly and true than we ever had before. As the X began to decline, we fell slowly silent and contemplative on the walk back to our tent. Just enjoying the marvelous epiphany we had been blessed with and marveling at the beauty of the night. Returning to the tent we fell asleep quickly and awoke just 5 hours later to an incredible sunrise.  No hangover, just a slight bit of drowsiness and fatigue. It has been over a week since this experience and I feel that I am still profoundly affected by it. I am still walking, sitting, and standing taller than before. My self confidence is through the roof. The love I feel for G is magnified. So many of the chains, hangups, doubts, etc that made my life miserable in the past are resolved and bother me no more. ", "I am confident of who I am and what I believe. I feel I am a much improved man. Reflecting on the experience sometimes brings me near tears because of the drastic realizations I have been blessed with. May this feeling never depart and may I always remember what I have learned!", "I did some ecstasy on Saturday. I got it from a guy I work with.", "It was a nice surprise!

Its left me with a sense of", "One night my fiance and I decided to go to a small rave up on top of a beautiful mountain.  The town that we live in is pretty small, so most of our parties end up being outdoors, which I think is quite condusive to a spiritual experience.  We arrived just as the party had gotten underway.  We had some MDMA, and proceeded to ingest one pill each.  It was about 11:00pm, I guess.  As time went by the party got better and better, we were both rolling pretty good.  After dancing for a while we went off to the side, under a huge pine tree, to smoke a bowl.  A girl I didn't know came up just to chat with us, and we offered to smoke with her, which made her very happy!  ", "  Anyway, around 2:00 we took our second pill, and the rest of the night is kind of a blur.  I remember seeing an older man, around 60 or so, who looked like he was not having a good time.  I went up to him and asked if he was ok, putting my hand on his stomach.  He looked at me funny, and said, 'You know, I am having some stomach pains tonight, right where you put your hand.'  I smiled.  He told me his name was Planet.  After we chatted a bit, I went back to dancing.  My fiance and I must have gone to bed (in the back of our pick-up that had a camper shell) around 4 or 5 am.  We woke up around 7 am, actually my fiance woke up, and I remained in the back of the truck while he went up front to drive us back into town because I had to be at work by 8 am.  I remember waking up sometime during the drive to ask him what time it was, then I went back to sleep.", "  The next thing I woke up to was chaos.  There was a tremendous noise, and I was extremely disoriented, I was being flung about like a rag doll, then I heard another huge BANG! and then all I saw was ceiling-floor-ceiling-floor.  I still feel my heart race when I think about the screams. There was one point when I was sure that this was *it* for me, and I will never forget that moment.  When all movement finally stopped, I was dazed, and my fiance climbed through the little window that connects the cab and the bed of the truck.  'What happened?' I asked.  'We got into an accident,' he replied.  Then I said, 'I can't feel my legs,' and then he began to cry.  I saw blood on his hands and forehead, and I was very concerned for him.  He told me not to move.  That's when I finally realized that I was *fucked* up, and the scariest part now was the quiet...we were down in a ravine, and we thought no one would know where we were.  But then, joy upon joy, we heard a voice from up on the highway call down to us, 'Are you alright?' We both replied in unison, 'No!!'  Evevntually he got someone with a cell phone to call an ambulance, and let me tell you, when those sirens are coming for you, there is no sweeter sound in the world.  Right then I knew I was going to live.  ", "  How did the accident happen?  I bet you can guess - he fell asleep at the wheel.  The truck went off the road at 60 mph.", "  After the paramedics put us on stretchers, they used the lamp post we had taken out on the way down to help slide us out of the ravine.  I was taken to our small hospital, which decided that my injuries were to serious for them to handle, so I was airlifted to a bigger town about 300 miles away.  To make a long story somewhat shorter, I broke three ribs, punctured my right lung, twisted two vertabre in my neck, and crushed or cracked about four in my back.  That last injury is the one that made me a paraplegic last Sept.  I have recovered nicely, and am able to laugh, something I thought I would never be able to do again.", "My fiance got away with just a few scratches, thankfully.  I have since forgiven him, in fact I never really blamed him at all, but I told him I forgave him because he needed to hear it to be able to  forgive himself.", "I'd like to make it clear that I am not against using MDMA.  In fact, I have used it since my accident and find it to be very theraputic.  What I am against is using it irresponsibly.  If you go somewhere to party that you have to drive home from, please, be sure that you are coherent and have had enough sleep.  And *always* wear your seatbelt.  Your life (or lifestyle, in my case) may depend on it.", "A few days ago i was with some friends, and one of them was buying marijuana.  Well I like pot, but however, i was in the mood for something else.  So i asked the person that my friend was buying the pot off of if they could get anything else, they said they could get ecstasy ('a roll') well imediately i thought 'No way' because ive done what i thought was X once before, Banana Brand, and it made me irritable and sick.  So reluctantly i said 'fine' being that Im not the type of person that would not give something a second chance.  I gave the person my money, and 10 mins later i had what was called a 'Pikachu'.", "    That night i went home, and waited before taking it, i made sure i did all the things i DIDN'T do last time, such as eat and prepare myself mentally.  At about 10:15 i took the little speckled pill, and waited. By 11:00 i started to get a warm sensation in my legs, hoping this wasnt all, i waited longer.", "    The last time i did, i had nothing like the warmth feeling, It was more like the feeling you would get when using epehdrine and caffeine.  Which after this night, im pretty sure thats what my first tablet was, i know it wasnt MDMA, thats for sure.", "    Well around 12:15, it had been two hours, and nothing signifigant had happened, except the warmth sensation that had overcome my legs, which was by this time gone, so i was assuming that someone had just got me for 20$.  I stayed in my room listening to music and talking on the phone.", "    At about 12:44am i went outside to smoke a ciggarette, and thats when it hit me, i had this weird, sort of peaceful feeling come over my body, its best described by pink floyd where they say 'i have become, comfortably numb' because thats what it was like.", "    Standing there, looking at the trees, they looked more lively than usually, almost like they were alive, the branches were swaying back and forth like tall grass in a breeze.  I actually had to blink it was that amazing, and i didnt want to stop looking.  I knew immediately that i wasnt going to be dissappointed at all tonite.", "    At about 12:55am i walked into the bathroom, to splash water on my face.  My pupils were large, and i realized that things look more ... perfect like they were done with great precision, i notice the lines between the tiles, they looked so uniform, the color of the bathtub, the walls looked different though, they looked sort of green.", "    I walked in my room, killed the lights and lit a candle. I felt great, like i was alive for the very first time.  I wanted to look at the trees again, i thought maybe id missed something, something more profound than there lifelike movements.  at about 1:30 i went back outside, but not to smoke, just too look, at the trees, the sky, it all looked like it was just formed at that moment.  Amazing.", "    I then decided id come inside and get online, because at the moment it was really too late to call anyone (i was unusally considerate of everyone) i thought maybe that friends would be online, I was right.  I got in contact with a close friend of mine, who i talked to about the expierence.  By this time, my heart was beating very rapidly, but i didnt seem to mind, ive done quite a bit of amphetamines in my time, and being that i knew MDMA was an amphetamine, i sort of expected the heartbeat.  I talked and talked to her, I was probably the happiest ive ever been, and normally im a sort of depressed person.  I went outside a few times more that night, just too look, i noticed the angles of the sidewalk, texture of grass, it blew me away.  I didnt want it to end.", "    Around 3am that night i decided that id lay down and think, being that ive heard that charishing your first few times on X was the smart thing to do, because you may never have anymore like it, i decided id think, id been having problems prior to that night.  So i laid there and thought, i thought about life, the human condition, i thought about things that made me sad, i thought about things that made me happy and i thought about solutions to most of these.", "   I got up to refill my water glass and use the bathroom, my pupils still big i looked at the clock, it was 4am, time had passed fast and most of the great effects were gone, except the mental effects, i was still in a state of great thought mentally. ", "   I'm not sure how much longer i laid there, but i know that i slept most of the next day and woke up feeling a bit grogy, but with a changed outlook, I had decided to look at everything from all points, and most importantly, to listen more than speak.  Not that i took a vow of silence, but i mean more along the lines of everyday problems, i learned that listening was almost as important as speaking, if not moreso.", "   After this expierence, i would say that the FDA should re-evaluate this chemical, I beleive it would do wonders for those with very severe depression, if used under medical supervision, and not on a theraputic basis, once or twice i think would be enough, i know that it sure helped me!", "Background:  34yr old male - 155lbs - 100mg of powder MDMA", "A friend of mine, who is a walking drug store, told me that he had gotten a hold of some X. This is unusual: he normally doesn't touch X, the DEA is in town looking for X, and he's about as paranoid as they come. He needed a front main seal on his car's engine replaced, so he offered me 1/10 of a gram (100mg) in exchange for fixing his car. (EZ Job) He gave me the X on the promise of fixing his car once the part came in. I held off on taking it for a week. I figured that I would let somebody else be the first on the block to try this batch first since it was slightly the wrong color and I had never done X before. The X that I had obtained was in the form of a light grey/brown powder. The part has yet to come in, but oh well, time to do it. It being a powder, combined with the fact that I had eaten 1/2 of a Jumbo pizza from Godfathers (18' big - Yes, I ate 1/2 of it), I decide to snort it, otherwise it would take forever to get past the pizza. I divided it out half and half, and did an allergy test by placing a few grains under my toungue for 15 minutes with a bottle of liquid anti-histamine ready. No reaction. Allergy test part II: I take about 5mg or so and sort it and wait 15 minutes. No reaction. Good. I snort 1/2 of the X at 6:45pm. OUCH!!! OW!!! JEEZ!!!  that burns the crap out of your sinuses - trust me. An almost immediate rush. Felt like I had done Coke almost, but no psychoactive reaction other than speed-like. It drips down the back of my throat, burning the whole way. Nasty, nasty taste. Nothing at all psychoactively.  I wait 30 minutes to make sure, and snort another 25mg, leaving 25 more. YOUCH!!! Again, burning sinuses and an almost immediate rush. This time, tho, I get some minor visuals, dizziness and a disconnected feeling from my body about 5 minutes after the rush begins. Right now, it is T +1:00 and I can feel something, but not much. I am sure that some dripped out of my sinuses and into my stomach to wait for the pizza to move out of the way. That may be delaying it slightly. T+1:20: I snort up the rest of it. Not as bad of burning this time. My sinuses must be getting numb. 1 Minute - no rush - 2 Minutes - no rush - 3 Minutes - here it comes, but not speed-like, but different. I feel very energetic, yet relaxed, but with the feeling that something is not quite right. I feel 'weird'. It reminds me of acid in a slight way, but not quite. Colors are a bit more intense, but my body feels like plastic. At T+1:40 I feel high and can barely type. My thoughts are much faster than I can type. I think of something I want to say regarding how it feels, but before I can type it, another, better thought has replaced it. As a result, I find myself constantly going back to edit what I had typed. Time is absolutly flying by. The last two hours feel like 20 minutes. I expected to feel my heart pounding in my chest, but I don't. Only two hours after my first snort, and I've consumed a whole liter of water. Goosebumps. EE-gads. A big chunk just dripped down my throat. YUK. I think it would easier and less painful to snort aspirin. I don't recommend this method to anyone. Now, other than a little worry from reading about a couple of people keeling over dead from this stuff. I'm feeling pretty good. T+2:00 WOW time is flying. This is a very subtle buzz. Unlike anything else I have done. X does not affect your mind to much. I can still think and censor thoughts and ideas, but something is different in my mind. Dizziness (slight), goosebumps and mild jaw-clenching are the only side effects. My body feels a little plastic-like. My heart is not racing. I feel light-headed and I feel like talking like crazy. And now it's getting very tough to type. I just read an article on PMA (paramethoxyamphetamine) being sold as MDMA. GREAT. WONDERFUL. Bring on some paranoia. Not the best trip I've ever had. I think from now on, I'll stick to bud and beer. At T+2:15, I feel almost nothing. I don't think that what my friend gave was X. What I do feel reminds me of a very mild acid trip. I am very awake with occasional hot flashes. My temp is 99.9. Hmm...  This is not very fun. I think I'll relax for a bit and see what happens. Relaxing is almost impossible. I feel like typing instead. I did notice that my sense of touch is a little more sensitive, but not much. Mostly it is a relaxed state of mind that flows freely unless you control it, which is easy. Mostly it gives a relaxed energy. The kind of relaxed pep you get when you win a close game of some sort, for example. There are times where I am hyped, and other times, sleepy; times where I'm tripping and others where I'm sober and completely lucid. Going on 10pm, now. The trip is definitely coming down. I am disappointed. I expected a lot more as far as a 'buzz' than this, and there were a little more side-effects than I would have cared for. I wish I had gotten some good, kind bud instead. Spend $20 on this? No thanks. Now I have to get greasy.", "Four days ago I tried MDMA for the first time. I didn't plan on it at all. A friend of mine, who is much more experienced with drugs then I am, had four pills with her. I decided to try it, and bought two from her.", "We sat outside in her front yard and took one pill each around 4 p.m. About a half an hour later I started feeling very hyper, joyful, and relaxed. Everything seemed brighter, more colorful. I felt warm all over, but at the same time I was getting sudden chills down my back. I tried explaining this, but it never came out making much sense. Actually, most of the things I felt made little sense. I was warm, but cold, I felt sick in my stomach for a little while, but yet, it was somehow a good feeling. Everything was a good feeling. I felt as if no matter what, everything was well. I felt as if I loved everyone and everyone would love me back. Everything was perfect. I was in my own little personal heaven. I had cravings for water, which tasted sweet, but otherwise I didn't want to eat. If I wasn't dancing in the driveway I was laying in the grass running my hands through it and staring at the sky. Everything felt good to the touch. The pavement or her rough tennis shoes felt even harder then normal, and slightly scared me if I felt them. Around 6 p.m. or so, she convinced me to eat some noodles because I hadn't eaten all day. They felt so wonderful in my mouth and instead of eating them, I played with them. We ran the noodles across our skin and they felt like cold rain. Water was amazing. She sprayed me with the hose at one point. I felt so alive. About 8 p.m. I took my second pill because I wanted the feeling to last longer. Soon after that I started feeling dizzy. I couldn't stand up too much because I wanted to make sure I would not fall over. I would move my upper body to the music and not realize it until she pointed it out. I just sat there moving like this for about two hours, in a daze. Soon after I fell asleep. I woke up the next day around 11 a.m. still feeling fine and somewhat giddy. I slept for hours that afternoon, still getting cold chills. I never felt a 'crash' or severe change of emotions afterwards. For the past 3 days I still had the 'perfect' feeling. Like everything was going to work out, everything would be perfect forever. Even now, four days later, I have the cold chills fairly often. I'm still getting a bit dizzy, much more then normal, and I still have slight 'perfect' feelings. Overall I enjoyed the experience. It was Perfect.", "This is a really lovely experience I had this July 5th. ", "About 8:45 pm I ingested 90-100 mg mdma in a glass of water. At the same time my brother drank a tea made with 4 grams of shrooms. This tea did not agree with him, so after puking violently, he decided to go for a walk, leaving me alone with a friend of his who was visiting. I had met this guy, but didn't know him very well. I could already feel the mdma coming on strong, a mere 20 minutes into my voyage.", "I sat quietly, thinking about (and worrying about) my brother, hoping he was doing alright. This friend of my brothers (we'll call him M) offered me some fresh jalapeno peppers in lime juice he had prepared, and I accepted. As I sat masticating his offering, I asked him if he had ever tried mdma before (BTW, he was not then on MDMA or anything else). He told me had, but that it had been during a bad time of his life. This led to us (two near strangers) discussing our respective forays into the darker areas of our psyches for long periods of time, and our methods we had used to heal ourselves and move on. We both concluded that these experiences, while extremely unpleasant, had been valuable and important. I felt a real connection to him.", "At this time, my brother returned, feeling much better for having taken his walk. He loaded a bowl of cannabis and we went outside to smoke it, while M went home for the night. We sat outside, my brother smoking and me just sitting there enjoying the beauty of the night. He told me he was feeling better and tripping now, and I told him the mdma was definitely working for me. I felt really good, really alive and keyed in to what was going on around me and inside me. The hyperaware feelings I get on 2cb were present. And while it wasn't precisely visual, I did get the odd 'tracer' and everything looked really wonderful.", "We decided to walk to a nearby park where my brother could play his drum. After the short and pleasant walk over there, we sat down on the grass to chill. Almost as soon as we sat down, I saw a brilliant shooting star. I was awed, and considered it a good omen.", "My brother started playing his drum and it sounded really cool. He claims to have no real sense of rhythm, but it sounded very evocative to me. When he would pause, we talked.", "We discussed our relationships, past and present. Our parents, and their unfortunately narrow reality tunnels were a prevalent topic. I told him how lucky I thought he was to have such a wonderful family (his wife is the coolest woman in the world, and he has a new baby). I even told him some things I had never been able to talk about (including one little piece of information I had not previously admitted even to myself, though as soon as I said it , I knew it to be true). Our discussion ranged over a number of topics, including my exwife, his trouble with coping with full on psychedelic experience, and my ambitions to write. It was an incredible, irreplaceable conversation, and I have mdma to thank for it.", "After a while, we got up and walked back to his house. The mdma was tailing off, but still had a definite presence.

Although I like to try new things 'clean', the trip had tailed off to almost nothing, and I felt I had a clear understanding of what the mdma experience was, so I decided to partake. He loaded his small glass pipe several times as we all three sat outside and discussed life, the universe and everything. I noticed that the cannabis seemed to add a visual element to the remains of the mdma. In the moonlight of the porch I detected very prominent 'patterning' over everything, and when I closed my eyes, I was greeted by visions of a very cartoonish nature. Bright colors, smooth textures. Maybe more like computer animation. I was pleasantly stoned and content to watch these patterns and shapes slide around behind my eyes.", "About this time we all headed for bed. I lay in bed watching these cartoons and listening to They Might Be Giants, which seemed to go very well with the cannabis/mdma pictures, until sleep overtook me.", "I found this experience to be very positive and enlightening. I found the empathogenic vector to be very pronounced, almost overwhelmingly so. I would be wary of being that opened up in inappropriate circumstances.

If not, then I do feel very lonely, incomplete, and I usually get obsessed with finding my soul-mate. There is no way I can dance, and some times I have cried for quite some time. The only thing I seem to want to do is 'Quddle' with someone that I know will feel the same after they've come down, and not just because of the drug.

It is obvious to me that Quddling is what I've missed (Wilson's Biosurvival circuit, oral, safety etc.) when I was young, It is something I will get over by partly supplementing this safety my self and partly by finding people that are willing to share their affection with me. This the main reason I take MDMA occasionally but very carefully, because I believe that this is a deep need that has to be faced/addressed/resolved instead of being suppressed/hidden and forgotten. Many times is hard and can be quite painful but I'm moving on and keep on moving.", "Now the point I wanted to get to from the start is that under the circumstances it sound that it would be a very bad idea to try LSD, well, I have more times than MDMA and I have a brilliant time. All I want to do is dance and become one with the music, the more parts of the music (even emotions) I can express with my body, the better. Is like marring time (music) with space (volume) and when I get into it suddenly there is a peak experience that makes me feel great, complete, love for everyone especially for those I can sense around me (since I always dance with my eyes shut), and I feel Quddled by the whole universe (hence Cosmic Baby). My world view changes and by present time seems as a transition, I can see where I'm going and where I could go, and everything makes sense, there is no helplessness involved like in MDMA nor involuntary regression, just the aware choice of been who I am the way I want to be, as curious, sensitive, genuine, enthusiastic as child and as responsible as and adult and as caring and understanding as a parent.", "Now the problem comes with LSD because is a loners drug, people don't give a shit if you feel genuine love for them, as long as you can't express it (with my eyes closed is a bit hard).

Over Labor Day weekend he consumed 7 pills. That was the last time he used it.

I discarded them soggy mushrooms (perhaps a waste, but I had a good supply). I added drinking chocolate to the brown liquid and drank it from a cup as I settled into bed on that warm Sunday - It tasted good! (I was feeling good, we had rocked the crowd at a show last night). I expect this would be half the dose required to fully trip for me.", "In the first hour the only effects I noticed were a slight pinkening of light and elevated mood. About 2 hours into it I felt as though the windows were merely projecting images - as the birds reeled in the sky they flowed together with squid - like motion, the giant gum trees thrashing in the wind were awe inspiring. About half an hour later, vague forms started to take shape - I had a very vague vision of a beautiful woman in the pink clouds, cradling a baby in ther arms. I felt this would be my future wife and first child. I was blissing out, but for some reason I felt like I should stay focused and on the lookout for teachings. ", "Around the third hour I became very aware of the pendants around my neck - one a greenstone given to me by my mother and the other a bone carving from my twin sister. I felt their support and was close to tears with joy. I raised my hands and they pulsed with a primal, animal energy. I wanted to explore this further so I went to the mirror and looked at myself. It felt like a warrior, and my physical form made more sense, as if I was receiving abstract instructions on how to use it more naturally. I went out and looked at my land - a beautiful valley threatened my developments surrounding it. I felt very protective, and suddenly a felt like I was a huge being with biblical - sized wings, which I was stretching out over my domain, protecting it. I feel that this was a glimpse of my true self, or spirit, or something like that - I don't really know.", "On the comedown I composed some beautiful beats that sounded like angels singing with perfect, powerful clarity - just for me.

I have spent most of the last 17 years taking trials of medications that psychiatrists prescribed to me with mixed and disastrous results.  It was coincidental that acquaintences of mine offered me mushrooms at a party. (I was not taking meds at this time.)", "Someone at the party produced a large bag of mushrooms he 'claimed' weighed about 30lbs. He also claimed that he stole them from a biology lab at his local Colorado college where fungicides were being tested.  He alleges the growing process made them extremely potent for clinical purposes.  The mushrooms were of different sizes and colors.  The small baby ones were dark blue and juicy.  The large ones were dry like ashes and golden in color with large caps.  ", "That night I was apprehensive, so it took about six beers before I was disinhibited  enough to even consider trying the shrooms.  The atmosphere was alcohol induced giddiness, and the peer group was of low emotional and intellectual evolution.  They prodded me a lot, since I have bad reactions to pot I was scared of getting the paranoias and anxiety, I knew nothing about mushrooms at the time. I did my own literary research afterward.  I was definitely curious.", "I finally broke down and ate about six of them, some small and some large.  I think someone with a scale told me they weighed about 4 to 6 grams total.  What followed was the most beautiful experience of my life.  I had multi-dimensional visions, and I was tranported to other", "places.  I heard beautiful music, and felt a strong connection to the other guests, the universe, and some interpretation of 'God' being in me and everywhere around me in different abstract forms.", "Needless to say I enjoyed the experience and repeated it again a handful of times over the next year or two.  What I find most profound is that the experience changed me on multiple levels in my life while not under the influence of the shrooms.  My symptoms of mental illness disappeared for several years afterward.  I was constantly full of energy, and I spoke to people I previously would have found unapproachable or uninteresting.  I became fully involved with life, and enjoyed things I never would have considered before.  I slept normally, had no depression or panic attacks, etc.  What is most amazing is this relief lasted long after the sessions ended.  I found I did not enjoy sessions where the atmosphere was party like or the people were just trying to get a 'buzz'.  I would prefer to retreat with one other person where I could enjoy the experience in a mutually interactive way, or just drift quietly. I don't recall if I ever did a session alone.  Another interesting fact is that my concentration improved and I was better at tasks that require careful attention.", "I suspect my psycho-illness symptoms result from a mixture of biological predisposition (family history), and post-traumatic childhood violence and sexual abuse.  I am just happy to share that mushrooms effectively relieved my suffering without daily taking pills with terrible mental and physical side-effects.", "This was about 5 years ago and I haven't had any shrooms since.  I have regressed slowly to my previous state, with some degenerative symptoms.  I am diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder with rapid cycling, panic disorder, and post traumatic stress.  I think the trials of psych-meds have damaged my thought processes and I continue to feel degenerative effects.  It is really sad that the war on drugs halted the research of hallucinogens in the field of psychotherapy.  I truly believe a medical miracle is being supressed.  Can anyone else relate to this?  ", "I am afraid to try eating shrooms again because Paxil and loads of other meds I don't take anymore have left my brain chemistry terribly imbalanced.  I am also physically dependent on oxycodone and hydrocodone opoids I take for pain and depression.  Are there medical contraindications for mixing these with mushrooms?  I am also contemplating getting on Methadone maintenance to balance out the mood swings the pain-pills induce and avoid the withdrawals they cause.  If I am making a mistake it is mine to learn.

Maybe we will live to see the day when the war on drugs eases up and medicine will use our planets precious resources to heal our minds and bodies.", "We started taking the shrooms at around 7:30 PM, the culmination of weeks of planning and anticipation. We were a dynamic bunch of people in a strange but comfortable environment, about to embark on a journey that for most of us, would be something we had rarely or never experienced. ", "Walt, the owner of the house, had not previously tried the magic mushroom, and his former drug experience had been limited to a few puffs of herb and the standard amount of drinking. I was somewhat worried about him, because I could see he was somewhat worried about himself, along with all the usual anxieties of a teenager throwing a party at his house with the parents away. ", "Pete was as experienced as me with the use of psilocybin, although he hadn't experimented with other psychedelics as much. I trusted he would remain one of the most stable members of the group, although I had never tripped with him to such an extreme before. Andrew was an old friend, who although had only turned on to drugs in the recent past, had already seen his share of strange shit. Most of all, I considered him a reliable companion, but I was somewhat concerned for him knowing that mushrooms had often made him quite ill. Bryan was a character whom I didn't know too well, but who seemed to be a good guy judging from my previous experience. He had also not been into drugs for too long, but had apparently established a reputation as a pothead at his school. Being a massive rugby player with a promising career in front of him, I liked having Bryan there in case Phil got out of control, but I only hoped that we wouldn't have to control Bryan. ", "Phil was someone I had gone to school with for years, and who seemed most eager out of all of us to experience the trip. When I had first met him he had been the embodiment of hyperactivity, but had settled down over the years until he could pretend that he was entirely normal around most people. Still, the two times that he had tried drugs with me after convincing me he had matured enough to handle them, I had been somewhat disappointed. It had been a long time since then, and I hoped he had changed, but I was slightly more worried about Phil than anyone else. \t", "I hadn't touched the stuff, or any powerful hallucinogen, in around a year, and I was experiencing my own share of anxiety for a number of reasons. Firstly, my mushroom experience had been a mixture of good and bad, the bad stemming mostly from the digestive aspect. I strongly preferred the LSD concept of placing a minuscule piece of paper on my tongue, to swallowing large amounts of vile tasting dried fungus. Also, I had been cast in the role of a guide by my friends, who assumed I possessed some sort of infinite wisdom on the topic of drugs. Sure I had done my share of reading, (most of it by Timothy Leary) but my actual experience was somewhat limited, and the knowledge that I hadn't tried these drugs in so long made me worry if I could maintain control throughout the night. I still felt as prepared as possible, having done a great deal of thinking about the evening, as well as reading some trip reports on the net and getting a good night's slee. ", "In our possession was what I had described as, 'a good fucking deal'. Three quarters of an ounce for some seventy dollars (Canadian). It had been divided into six equal piles, none of which amounted to more than one of us should be allowed to handle. I took most of mine and brewed it into tea, my first experience of the kind. This was in the hopes that I would avoid any intestinal trouble. We were running around an hour late, and everyone was in a rush to dose, and I wasn't able to make all the 'ground rules' as clear as I liked. ", "Shortly after 8:00 it began to kick in for me, but I was well prepared, expecting a quick onset from the liquid mushrooms. By this time everyone else's trip was also beginning, although three of us had left to grab something from a nearby car. When they came back the energy level shot up, and the physical sensations of the trip became apparent. I began to get nauseous, and an attempt to leave the room in search of Phil and Walt led to me vomiting up everything I had consumed. My error seemed to have been in making the tea too diluted, forcing me to drink two huge cups, and leaving a third unfinished.", "Walt and Phil were found talking on the porch, and Walt eventually came down to the basement to hang around with everyone else, but the disappearance of Phil, and then Walt and Pete who went to find him, triggered a mildly stressful situation as the rest of us hypothesised comical and grim scenarios. Suddenly we were hit with another grave problem. Initially, Walt's 200-CD player had seemed to be a blessing, something we could just stuff with the night's music and not have to worry about again. But a mix CD of Pete's, (who had now left) would not cease playing, and featured parts of a book-on-tape rendition of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, read by some absolutely horrible actors who drove us absolutely nuts. In one of those drugged quests that always seem to spring up on strong psychedelics, me and Andrew struggled with the machine for what seemed like an eternity, until we could reassert our dominance over technology and play Andrew's preferred choice of music, my Paul Okenfold album.  ", "It was around this time, (9:30) that I discovered the other members of the group were all safe upstairs. The trip had had a strong effect on them, but they seemed to be riding it out pretty well. I was still a little queasy but feeling much better. I had the notion that my vomiting had expelled much of the drugs from my system, and I was experiencing the equivalent of at the very most, a 2 gram trip. I was not nearly as disappointed this time however, as when I had previously tried such an amount. Patterns were moving in ways surprisingly familiar to me, (it felt like only a few weeks since I had had my last trip) the lights kept varying intensity, and time ticked by like I would stay high forever. The majority of the sensations were still physical in nature however, and my sense of touch seemed particularly enhanced.", "Briefly, we all got in one room and once again the energy level spiked, slightly overwhelming Phil. Trance blared on a massive surround-sound system, and a minute of joyous dancing reminded me how much I wanted to rave again. Then Phil began demanding more shrooms, saying he wanted it to last longer. I asked him if he was sure, then gave him my last cup of tea, which I was going to flush down the toilet anyway. I saw him a minute later with a mouthful of dried mushrooms from his or someone else's stash, but Phil was happy and in control. However, I knew the tea had not yet kicked in and he was setting himself up for one hell of a ride. In the kitchen where I was getting a glass of water, he confronted me and asked to buy my remaining mushrooms. I refused, and he began to struggle with me to get it out of my hand. In order to avoid a physical escalation which would pit him against us and possibly ruin a few people's night, I relented and handed it over. Me, Walt, and Pete then hounded Phil to give it back, and we eventually got our wish, although Phil had already eaten some and we seemed to have made him visibly depressed. Later I ascertained that this was when the drugs truly began taking hold of him.", "Me and Walt shared our own little quest to find his blanket so that we could stand out on his patio and talk. Eventually we succeeded, and the seemingly unending crawl towards 10:00 PM reached its end. By this time I was coming down some, and felt my communication skills to be mostly unimpaired. We stood there for the better part of an hour, talking about the meaning of life, the bullshit of society, the annoying aspects of school, people who pissed us off and why. ", "Then we were interrupted by calls from the house, and found that Phil had totally lost touch with his sense of reality. Later he described the understandable feeling of overload, (we estimated he had had 8 grams) and unending confusion. He was upstairs saying and doing utterly embarrassing things, and had eventually retreated under Walt's bed. He had also broken a CD case and cut himself, and from the sound of things I wanted no part in his trip. Despite my label as 'the responsible one', I feared Phil was still pissed off at me, and I didn't think he wanted to be helped. I was having a great time and only wanted it to continue. Phil also seemed to have infected Pete and Bryan with some sort of primal energy, and the three of them had, as Hunter S. Thompson would have described them, 'degenerated to the level of dumb beasts'. They were running around upstairs talking like horny cavemen. Phil especially seemed to be looking for a wet hole to screw, but eventually me and Walt reassured ourselves that he was no danger to himself or the property, and we went back outside.", "It was clear that Walt was having a good time, and he was glad he had not taken more than around 2 grams. Although I had only gotten to know him in the previous months, he was a great guy to share an intelligent moment with, and kept his wits about him throughout the whole trip. We reflected on how few people knew the true definition of fun, and speculated on the tumbling stock market and the end of civilisation. Eventually we talked about girls, a large source of anxiety for me at the moment. ", "I checked up on Andrew once, lying in the downstairs bathroom, but then forgot about him for a long time. When I finally came downstairs with Pete to see him again, I feared I that I had walked into my friend's personal nightmare. I felt downright stupid for leaving him alone. The expression on his face set off a million alarm bells, but when he managed to choke out, 'it all makes sense' through his tears and reassured me that he was alright, I felt a massive load release from my shoulders. I left him there to reflect in peace, because it seemed like that was what he wanted.", "Everyone except Andrew and Phil, who was still under the bed, converged in the living room. We were all coming down now, and were able to look back and share a few words among friends. Soon, Walt's sister came home with some people and Andrew was forced to leave the downstairs and join us. Bryan had apparently had a good time, and I concluded that he was indeed a good individual to have on a trip. Pete had also seemingly smartened up after being exposed to some saner company, and he had written a short paper on why drugs were not for the faint of heart. We bitched a lot about Phil, and I re-evaluated my opinion that he wasn't worth trying drugs with again. Finally I decided that we should never again leave so much around for him to take. ", "By around 11:30 he came down and joined us, and his ability to navigate the house and go to the bathroom was seen as a hopeful sign. Tense moments followed, as Phil uttered dozens of obscenities concerning our mothers and teachers with a smile on his face, which I concluded was more of an irrational attempt to provoke us than a revelation of his inner self. We were especially concerned with Phil's numerous calls for Walt's younger sister, who was easily within earshot and clearly seemed the type to panic.", "At around 12:30, me, Andrew, and Pete felt sober and ready to drive home, and the knowledge that Bryan was staying behind to keep an eye on Phil made me feel as if we had succeeded in our efforts to accomplish a great trip without any negative repercussions. What I didn't know is that Walt and Bryan would soon pass out, leaving Phil alone and still wired. He later said he barely avoided totally freaking out, and only regained control early in the morning. ", "I drove home in the hopes of finding my brother with some grass, the one thing I needed at the moment. Unfortunately he was gone, but the mushroom vibes were still present, and I wound down the evening in front of the TV. After catching and recording a music video I had been looking for, I called it a night and went to bed around 2:00.", "It was an experience that had more than lived up to my expectations.", "As I started my trip, I had the giggles. Everything seemed as if I was high.  Lights and big street signs seemed to be in front of my face.  As my friends started tripping it seemed to worry me, so I took off to a friend's house.  As I was running down the street, I found myself standing in the middle of the street looking around not knowing what I was doing.  As people drove by staring I began to panic.  People started coming out of their houses wondering what I was doing in the street, so again I went sprinting down the street.  Next thing I know a police car rolls up behind me scaring the living shit out of me. I take off through yards and yards and passed house by house. I finally made my way to my original destination, which was my friend's house, who was tripping out somewhere.  When I got in the house his family was in the livingroom and it seemed as if their appearances were all totally different.  So I went in the basement and started freaking out.  My friends finally showed up with other people who were straight.  So one of the straight people took me in the back of the basement, because I thought I had to throw up.  Though I tried for about 4 hours, nothing came up.   At the same time, shit just kept getting more scary.  Next thing you know there must have been a million demons coming after me, plus the hundreds of bugs that were crawling on me. I must have passed out or something.  Next, waking up in my guy's bed screaming and crying, not aware of why this was happening.  Though after a time, all of the demons, bugs, devil faces and the screaming and crying, it finally wore off leaving me depressed as shit and not being able to sleep for an additional 4 hours.  But anyways, that was an experience that I will never forget.", "My family owns a cottage in the muskoka lakes area; it is a modest house on an absolutely breathtaking lake surrounded by coniferous woods. My family usually goes up there around august, but this summer i decided to venture earlier and meet some friends at their cottage just across the lake. I brought up the essentials for my partying: liquor, pot and fungus (about 10 grams in case anyone else wanted them). But to my surprise, my friends were not at their cottage and i was forced to spend 2 nights alone. The first night i rented a movie and had a couple drinks with it, followed by some good, old-fashioned sleeping in. ", "The next evening was an experience i'll never forget. The day started off simple enough, with a hot cup of coffee and a cigarette. I then went to see if my friends were home yet, and with luck, i had caught them as they were packing up to go back to the city for another week. However they purchased most of my mushrooms from me, leaving me with about 4 grams for myself. I decided that night was when they would be consumed. Besides, i hadn't had a spiritual experience for a while, so why not?", "    I went to town and rented another movie, and at about 7 o clock i began watching. As the previews rolled by, i noticed the lack of anything else to eat with my shrooms. All i had left was pop. So i took a piece of paper, folded it in half the long way, and poured the dust in the fold. I funneled all the dust into my mouth as i tipped my head back and took a swig of my coke. The combo fizzed unexpectedly, overflowing in my mouth and spilling approx. a gram of fungi. I reluctantly swallowed the remaining mix, and grimaced from the bittersweet taste. I continued watching my movie and didn't notice any differences until the ending, when forrest gump's face began to ebb and flow in tiny ripples. I looked around the living room, at the setting sun, and felt a visual equivalent of sexual arousal, i wanted to intensely observe my surroundings all i could.", "It went like that for about 2 hours, me sitting in the living room, taking in my surroundings and sensing so many things at once that i felt i had to get out; although i was the only one in the house, i felt i had to get out. My sudden claustrophobia caused me to jump out of my recliner and to the screen door, i rushed out the door as if not getting away from something anymore, but magnetized toward something. I felt myself walk along the lakeside not exactly sure of where i was going, but positive that i was going somewhere. My instinct told me just to keep walking.", "It felt like about a half hour that i trod the shoreline, my eyes fixed on the water still as glass. I contemplated whether or not it would be possible for me to walk on the glassy surface, or to iceskate in the middle of summer. ", "My eyes strayed straight ahead as i realized i was at a resort on the same lake as my cottage. My purpose became dreadfully clear: i was to find myself near here. I kept tracing the shoreline until i came to the clearing that was the golf course. It was truly a magnificent sight to behold; i saw a perfectly trimmed grass clearing, with the crystal clear lake to one side, with the moon reflecting softly off the water. On the other side of the clearing was the dark, menacing woods,casting shadows and concealing evil, no doubt. I felt frightened by the woods, but reassured myself by refixing my eyes on the water. ", "And so i walked on, coming to the center of the golf course and noticing in the moonlight a white object placed in the middle of the course. I walked closer until i could make it out, then stopped in bewilderment. It was a muskoka chair (adirondack chair for you yankees) placed, oddly enough, in the middle of the goddamn golf course. What purpose would it serve? I suddenly realized it was there for me. I was to find myself in this chair. ", "Slowly i lowered myself into the chair, it was covered in dew and faced toward the lake. I took this as a metaphor for how i should live. I should begin looking at the good(lake) and stop my pessimism by turning my back to the bad(woods).", "As i looked out into the water, i began thinking about myself and how i had been living my life lately. My career had come secondary to socializing and i had neglected my family for the past year. I could see myself in the lake as if it had turned from glass into a mirror, showing me what i was doing in my life and how to change it. I came to the divine realization that only hard work and optimism could make me into the kind of person i wanted to be. I sat in the chair until sunrise, when i promptly marched back home and got some much-needed sleep. I had beats pounding through my head at 4 a.m. and they had since died away. ", "My life has drastically been changed by this experience and i haven't done mushrooms since. My hard work and optimism have paid off in a recent relationship and a promotion at my job. I feel refreshed every day i wake up and i have those 3 grams of mushrooms to thank for it. They opened my eyes to what's really going on in my life.", "Well, this happened a few months back in February or March.  Me and three other friends (Baz, Chris and Derek) decided to do shrooms one weekend.  I had done them about 6/7 times before, and was pleased with the high, but nothing could prepareme for what was about to happen.", "We ate three grams of shrooms in Chris' room.  His room is the perfect setting for a psychedelic trip.  He has a black fury carpet, but his ceiling isnt finished (his room is in the basement).  From his ceiling he has old CD's hanging from string and has black, red, and green lights throubnout his room.  On his walls he has miniature pepsi signs painted on and a Molson Canadian logo which covers the whoe wall.  He also has a beer can plane hanging from his ceiling.", "After twenty minutes of eating the shrooms I felt a little dizzy, so I lay down on his bed, then in about 10 min it hit me.  We started up with the usual gitty behavoir that a pre-shroom high always consists of.  Then, Chris played the 18 minute version of Dazed and Confused by Led Zepplin.  During the song the shrooms kicked in full gear and we were off ona psychedelic trip, by the end of the song we were all fucked beyond belief.", "The colours in his room were reflecting off the CD's and into my eyes.  None of us could talk to each other because wehen we tried it sounded like endless echo coming from our mouths.  I put my head inside chris drawer and I felt like I was attached to it somehow.  Then I fell on the floor and went on for almost and hour about how 'nothing is always and the present is tomorrow'...just mindless ramble.  My friends had three mouths it looked like, and Baz was playing his guitar (we had just begun to learn so he wasnt taht good) but it sounded reqally cool.", "It's too bad I waited this long to post this, becuase some of the cool stuff that happened I can't recall at this moment.  We ate the shrooms at like 9:00 pm and were high till about 3:00am, but only because we smoked a joint at around 1:30.  The experience was cool as well because it knocks down any insecurity I have and it lets me be myself completely.  All that aside, this was my only true psychedelic high, and I loved it sooo much that I want to try LSD ASAP.  So anyone who is thinking of doing shrooms, hang in there and take them a few more times, it took me 7 or 8 tries before it got really good.", "I had been looking forward to New Year's Eve before the REAL new millenium,  2001. I had taken a break from drugs for a month or so, with the occasional joint here and there, just to ensure that I had a fairly clean slate for the night I had planned.", "Around 7 o'clock, I dropped my 'shrooms, and started to welcome people into my house. The fun was about to begin. Once about 10 people had arrived, someone suggested that we hotbox my sauna, which we had done before, on numerous occasions. So, I cranked the sauna up, and we all sat around for an hour, waiting for it to heat up. During this hour, I downed half a 26er of Absolut Mandarin, and began to slowly drink down my 40 of Bull Max (much better than Colt).  Once the sauna was nice and hot, and I was nice and buzzed, we all headed downstairs and prepared our pipes and bongs for a night of heavy use.", "As soon as the heat hit me, I think it triggered the 'shrooms, and I began to imagine that the notches in the cedar were fish, swimming in a wood sea. I was later informed that I said the above idea out loud, and also told my girlfriend that I felt like Jesus. Don't ask me why.", "After a few passes of my pipe, I sat back and closed my eyes. I could hear music from upstairs, but could only make out the bass. I began to feel the bass. It intensified, and with my eyes closed, I could see the music moving in my head. Then, somehow I, rather we, were all back upstairs, watching tv. I had no idea how I got there, or if we had even gone down into the sauna. But I didn't question myself, and I just sat back and talked, enjoying the high that my 'shrooms were presenting me with.  The tv image looked blurry, as if someone had put a fan in front of the tv. The audio was choppy and somewhat quiet. Whenever someone spoke, it sounded as if they were speaking through a megaphone, or a mic at a department store. Not as loud, but very very screechy, piercing.", "Around 10 o'clock, I had polished off the 40 and was beginning to feel drowsy, as if I hadn't slept in months. But, I fought off the sleepy feeling and pushed my way back into reality, where I was still sitting in my 'safe' chair, as I called it that night.", "At this point, the 'shrooms were in full effect, and whenever someone talked to me, it looked as if they were  in slow motion. Everything was slow. My thoughts and speech were almost inaudible. I decided it was best not to talk, and just stare into the tv.", "Around 11:30, I went into my room to relax with my girlfriend, and listen to some Air (Premiers Symptomes, excellent album).", "The next thing I know, I wake up, and look at my clock. 3:14am. What the hell happened? I found my girlfriend passed out on the couch, the tv still on. A few scattered bodies were lying on chairs, the floor, wherever they could crash. I woke up one of my buddies, who told me I had missed New Year's, something, which I already knew. ", "I took my girlfriend back to bed with me, feeling a bit sick, but otherwise, back to normal.", "I really wish I could have been coherent enough to appreciate the night. But regardless, it was an experience worth repeating. Perhaps, on a less important day.", "I have compiled an account of today's psilocybin experience. As will become apparent, the encounter was intensely personal, intensely emotional. But then, why do we poison ourselves so, if not precisely for these effects? I include those parts here in the interest of science, that the virtue of these sessions can be understood. This is in the face of prevailing hysteria over the issue of 'drugs', which informs national public policy, and which is based largely on stereotypes and ignorance. I do not advocate casual use of these substances. On the contrary, they demand the utmost respect, as I have learned today. But read on. ", "The main text (in bold) was written while under the influence of approximately 3 grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms. The surrounding commentary was added later. This experiment took place in my apartment, on a Sunday afternoon. After consuming the mushrooms, with orange juice, I did some Yoga stretches to relax into a more receptive mode. I then sat cross-legged on the floor, the lights out, earplugs in (I live in a noisy city, okay?), quieting myself. The effects came on in about 25 minutes. I did not begin writing for some time. ", "When I did this with S., we both cried. We weren't sure why. Now it seems that, perhaps, it was that we had been shown the impermanence of things. That is cause for sorrow and joy -- or neither: it is the way of the cosmos.", "My previous mushroom experience, with this same batch, was conducted with my girlfriend, in her apartment. We each found ourselves crying, for reasons we could not explain. Today's adventure sheds new light on that. ", "Life is a miracle! Others have said it. But let me now be counted as one who has said it, too. It is miraculous that this flesh, which someday shall stiffen and fall, could move, could feel, could think.", "I find myself looking at my hands, imagining how someday they would harden in death. They look pale, plastic, the fingers a bit too long. But they seem distinctly features of a living system. I am fascinated by the rough edges of the cuticle, the frayed edge of growth, the uncertain tip of becoming. ", "I am the entire history of the planet. The present is all there is.", "Contemplating the evolution of life on Earth, I see myself as the ongoing product of all the lives that preceded me. Visions of the sea come before me, of life struggling on coastal rocks, of birds overhead. The present is the moving summation of all that has gone before; all things are interrelated. I understand myself as the continuing culmination of the evolutionary process. ", "We are scared, inside. Fear eats at us from all around. We appear, as it were naked, given into this world, told we have parents, who love us... But I am telling my story here.", "The anxiety begins. The ego's defenses are being stripped away, and I see myself as a fragile, transient disturbance in a realm of infinite complexity. I am losing the illusions which I hold onto to feel secure. We are not the people we assure ourselves daily of being, but frightened children, grasping for assurance. We are terrified of death, so we deny it. But when truly confronted with our own impermanence, the games we play and the crutches we lean on do seem to fade! Still, I count my blessings, feeling thankful for having such loving parents and friends. Many others are not so lucky. ", "Those who tell us not to do psychedelics fear confrontation with the essential anxiety of being.", "We live in a society which denies death, and in so doing, denies life. Entheogens force us to confront essential issues of life, death, and identity. This is, really, what people fear about them. They fear it so much that they would stop others from investigating these mysteries. ", "We cried at the realization of what we are. Or what we are not.", "Another reference to the previous trip. Self-realization, self-revelation, can be a profoundly disturbing experience. But does it therefore follow that ignorance is preferable? ", "I have to attend to the matter of my life. It is like a plant, or a garden, which must be tended. There does seem to be an integrity to those who work with the earth, [who] rely on it. ", "Sensing the reality of my eventual dissolution, I feel the urgency of cultivating a life that is meaningful and beautiful. Too often I take the safe and habitual route. The metaphor of the garden presents itself: life as an organic phenomenon. We do not create our destiny outright, but like a gardener we can plant seeds and tend them. It occurs to me that growing plants is in many ways an alchemical project. Gardening involves all the ingredients of self development: discipline, intelligence, love... Like alchemy, it is a microcosm of spiritual evolution. ", "Whatever happened to 'striking out to find one's fortune,' like in all the old stories? The things that we take for granted hold us back. ", "Many tales begin with the youth setting out from home, seeking his destiny. There was the implication that destiny would, in fact, find him. None of this pre-fab future, with everything planned out from school to nursing home. That is a denial of destiny. The more we take for granted, the less sensitive we are to the prompting of opportunity, and the more vulnerable when our foundations crumble... ", "If these mushroom experiences are not euphoric it is because I am a sad person at heart. ", "I must make changes in my life. I want to farm, to live off the land, to work with my hands. But what is happening to us? What is this history going on all around us? ", "Perhaps living in Manhattan makes me overly nostalgic for the 'simple life', that pastoral idyll of intimate communion with the land. But I think it holds up to scrutiny. To live off one's own harvest is to rely as much upon one's self as on the earth. But is it really what I want to do? The close of the Twentieth Century seems to herald astounding changes in the nature of human civilization. Can I afford to be isolated, not to contribute?", "It just occurred to me that history is intimately bound up with communications media. I mean, if things seem to be moving faster, it is, in part, because we are so informed about so much. ", "Superficially, this is obvious. But I am talking about the perception of history. Perhaps the sense that things are speeding up is in part an illusion created by all the information that bombards us. Is it that more is happening, or that we just know more about it? Of course, there is a feedback loop at work here. Information does not passively circulate, accumulating in manageable puddles. It changes what it touches, affecting in turn the flow of occurrence which it describes. I remain convinced of the acceleration of historical currents. ", "I am an historical creature. Is there a part of me that is not? If I have seen it, it went unrecognized. ", "I do not stand outside the world, looking in. I am a part of it, a feature of the universe, the product of all that is and has ever been. Not just my body, but my mind, my sense of self. There is no sign here of the angelic component of the Self which so many mystics report. Or perhaps I am overlooking something that is right under my nose. ", "The fact is, I am depressed. I did not want to admit that to myself, but it now seems unavoidable. I am sad. Is this 'the Human Condition?' Or can something be done about it? ", "This sadness surprises me. I consider myself an optimist, one who is well-adjusted -- without being too complacent. But there has always been a melancholy streak, a sobriety in the midst of all my laughter. The things I need come easily, but what of the things I value? It is unclear whether this melancholy derives from the facts of my own individual existence, or if it is a fundamental sadness in the human soul. We are eaten up with a longing for... for what? What is this thing within us, driving us forward, calling our name from the deepest Abyss? ", "Everything is so complex. It becomes overwhelming. I am a sad monkey, trying to keep up. ", "I am being shown many layers of meaning simultaneously. I am seeing myself from the inside out and the outside in, a sweep which encompasses the whole vastness of the universe. It is too much -- how could we ever hope to understand anything? ", "Intensely sad. Is it the fungus? It seems to bring this with it. And yet the sadness is within myself. ", "The behaviorist interpretation of all this is that the mushroom itself caused me to be depressed: I ate it, and became sad. But is it 'just the drugs'? None of this seems like whacked-out raving to me. It still makes sense, the next day, though I no longer feel the sadness. Actually, I feel really good now, having passed through the ordeal.", "Do I want to study? Graduate school? It is an abstraction. ", "One of the major issues facing me now. It is often talked about, but I don't understand what kind of commitment this is. ", "I am experiencing the wrath of Teonanacatl. He shows you what you are, and there is no way to run from it. Far from 'special effects' and amazement, what I am being shown is the banality of my life. Why live in New York City? Why live in any city? ", "Teonanacatl: the Aztec name for the mushroom. It means 'the flesh of god.' All this soul-searching feels very much like a lesson I am being taught by a stern disciplinarian, but for my own good. This is real knowledge, it is what I came here for; it is what I am getting. I am being taught about myself -- not superficial curiosities, but things that are of ultimate importance to me, normally avoided for fear of change. I continue to reevaluate my current living situation. ", "I have to make some decisions. I have to figure out what I really value and what I do not. And though it is painful, I must face it, and do so alone. ", "I find myself looking at my life: we make decisions about who we are. Student? Farmer? What do I want to do? We do not need parallel universes; this one is strange enough.  The mushrooms, this weekend, alone, has precipitated some sort of emotional crisis. It is as though all the issues that I defer and file away somewhere are now reintroducing themselves to me, demanding acknowledgment, demanding payment. ", "And regardless of who let them in the front door, they are quite real. ", "All this talk of globalism -- the world is still a much bigger place than we usually care to admit. ", "Worldwide communications, the death of nationalism, new paradigms -- let none of this be confused for adequate knowledge of the world. Surprise lies potent at all levels of reality. ", "Immense sadness. Who am I? Am I this collection of habits, compromises? ", "The mushroom brings with it whatever lessons it feels are appropriate. Knowledge of self is not an easy thing. ", "This truly sums up the experience. Most people would consider this a 'bad trip.' I was intensely nervous, shaken to the core, biting my nails, my lips, standing in the middle of the room gazing in horror into empty space, peering out the window, hoping for relief, near tears. At no point did I regret what I was doing. I recalled accounts of the shamanic experience, wherein the self is torn apart by the ancestor spirits, so that it may be constructed anew. This wasn't quite so intense, but the elements were there. Such a crisis is the source of strength, if properly understood. The mushroom demands trust; otherwise, all is madness. ", "LATER: Almost back to baseline. The mushroom is a tool for introspection. It holds up a mirror and forces one to gaze upon it. ", "It is an ontological catalyst. Whether the experience is ecstatic or terrifying depends, in part, on the kind of information one needs. This is not a path which everyone should take. Not everyone wants to see themselves revealed, unpeeled and pinned to the board in front of them. Self-knowledge is not a checklist of niceties and foibles, it is a furnace where the impurities burn. And the more fuel, the hotter the blast. ", "I cannot overemphasize the value of this experience for me. It is not what I expected, and yet surely it has changed me. How can anyone, reading these words, dismiss this as hallucination or delusion? I invite them to try it themselves, and then tell me why I should be considered irresponsible -- or a criminal -- for doing what I have done.", "Recently, I had my first experience with shrooms.  I won't elaborate on the trip (beyond saying that it was absolutely incredible, enlightening, and astonishingly dazzling) - because I want to share with everyone the preparation that we consumed - Magic Hot Chocolate!", "Firstly, start off by setting to boil enough water for a cup for each tripper. Wash your shrooms to get the dirt off, then once the water has come to a boil, chuck in enough of them for everyone.  Turn down the heat, let cook for about 10-15 mins.", "Strain the liquid through a cloth into a jug, and you can then discard or re-boil the shrooms again to get every last bit out of them.", "Now mix together some cocoa, sugar & honey to taste in a seperate cup, add a little water and stick it in the microwave until it almost boils over, mix, add to the mushie-jooce, stir well, and serve!", "The drink should keep well and tastes nothing of mushrooms, just delicious chocolate - which is really nice when you have some more during your trip :)", "My first experience with mushrooms was a good one, fortunately. It all started with boredom... I was sitting around one weekend and conveniently, a friend had a shroom hook-up. I had wanted to try mushrooms for awhile so I was eagerly awaiting the experience. Not too much preparation went into this trip, considering that the mushrooms were talked about, bought and eaten within 5 hours. ", "I was at a friend's house. My boyfriend was there (which was who I tripped with) and 2 or 3 other friends who were just going to stick to beer and weed for the night.  My boyfriend and I each ate about 2 fat caps and 2 stems around midnight and waited. He started playing a video game with the others and I paced around, a bit nervous at not knowing what to expect. I curled up in a chair, fetal postition, and looked around. That night I was dressed comfortably for the trip... a sweatshirt and pajama bottoms... The pajama bottoms were flannel and white, with a pattern of little black cartoon bats all over. 30 minutes had gone by since we dosed. Looking at my pants, I started to trip...", "Staring at the bats, I noticed them starting to flap their wings. I found this incredibly amusing and started to laugh. However, I felt a little silly just laughing randomly in a room full of somewhat sober people and planted a hand over my mouth, trying to stifle any laughter. I racked my brain trying to figure out what the hell was so funny! I was fairly certain that there was absolutely nothing humourous going on at the moment so I sat quietly, my hand remaining over my mouth. About 45 minutes had gone by when the others finished the game and got up to talk, drink and smoke. I realized my boyfriend was no longer in the room... Must've went to the bathroom or something. Yep, definitely tripping by now.. I started to notice how everyone's face was green. And I couldnt really understand what they're saying... Not that I was really interested anyway... The others can tell I was tripping by now too, and approached me, hoping to scare me by making faces. I found this hilarious rather than scary. I started laughing hard and ran to behind a chair to hide.", "Everyone was staring at me!!!! This part was a little scary. I was peering over the chair to see if my tormentors had left when I turned to my right. There, I saw 2 of the guys there sitting next to me in chairs. The dog was there too, sitting between them, all 3 of them staring at me! And I knew who those guys were... I was friends with all the people in the house, yet suddenly I couldn't remember who they were. I couldn't remember their names... I couldn't remember my name! ", "I had to move... I got up from the couch and walked around the living room a bit where the walls were slowly and steadily breathing. The room was alive! The thought didn't scare me though... It intrigued me. I loved it! I felt ecstatic, happy that I could share life with this room... happy we could breathe the same air. I moved on to the kitchen, feeling spiritual. I stood at the kitchen's entrance and watched as the kitchen stretched and grew before my eyes. I wanted to walk through the kitchen but decided it would be pointless since the room was constantly growing. I wouldn't make any progress. Better go back to the living room.... There, I focused on a lightswitch, watching it changed colors and then moved my attention to the blinds in the window and studied them carefully as they too changed colors and swayed back and forth as if they were underwater. ", "Finally my boyfriend returned, highly recommending the bathroom. He had been gone for hours it seemed, and I told him how I had missed him. He was the only one I was able to recognize. We decided to go to the couch. The couch was big and purple and velvet..very comforting. However when we got there, we discovered a large red and white checkered quilt laid out across it. Have you any idea what red and white checkered ANYTHING does to a person on shrooms?!? I stood and stared down at the forming patterns for awhile. The red was really vivid and seemed almost menacing... so different from the soft pinks, greens and yellows cascading over the walls. I finally looked away and sat down next to my boyfriend where we both started to sink into the couch. We didn't mind... It seemed safe there. ", "People continued to talk to us, trying to scare us and we did start to grow nervous. So much so that we each took a lace on my sweatshirt (You know the things you pull to tighten the hood ;)) and stuck it in our mouths, convinced they were 'life-lines' and we needed them to survive. Those laces quickly became like security blankets.. If one happened to fall out of our mouths, we would desperately search through the intricate labrynth that the couch had become until we relocated it and stuck it back into our mouth and continued to chew nervously on the plastic tip. Suddenly, someone knocked. We both focused our stares at the door nervously, asking repeatedly what was there. In walked the girlfriend of one of the guys there and we both relaxed. At some point, someone gave us each an orange tic-tac, which we enjoyed immensely and savoured for as long as possible.", "It was probably around 2am or so when I started to peak hard on the couch, colors swirling all around me. The room was still alive and breathing and now started to grow like the kitchen. It continued to grow until I felt like me, my boyfriend and the couch were miniature, and we were trapped in this gigantic room! Most everyone had left by this point and my boyfriend and I were left in the living room alone. I stared at my hands which had somehow turned 2-dimensional and orange...bright orange, and they seemed to glow. They were also strangely small.. much smaller than a normal person's hands. I started to worry about my abnormal hands, but was quickly distracted by the big-screen tv.", "My friend had put on a dvd of Cirque Du Soleil for us before going to bed. Now, I don't know if you've ever seen Cirque Du Soleil but it's a surreal combination of some very trippy shit in a circus atmosphere. This one act consisted of jump-ropers, doing some really fancy, impossible-looking tricks and there were so many colors and lights and so many people moving... and the music!!! The music was very fast and was scaring us so that we were pressed against each other, embracing tightly. ", "We decided to travel to the bedroom where I discovered how soft and wonderful and cold the sheets were. We laid in bed, coming down. I closed my eyes and watched the colors pixilate for awhile before I noticed I couldn't breathe. I have asthma and must use an inhaler every night... and it surprised me that I was actually able to find and utilize the inhaler... correctly... Not much more happened... It just took a long time to get to sleep which was a little frustrating. The entire trip lasted about 8 hours...a bit too long.. the sun was up and I vaguely remember seeing the clock say 8:30 before I went to sleep. But otherwise, the trip was very positive and encouraging for the first time and I've appreciated many others since then.", "Last weekend, three friends and I went out to the mountains in hope of finding some Golden tops. I was extremly excited as i had taken them once before at home and could not get over the sheer beauty of the experience.", "Anyway, we did find some in the cow paddocks and all of us ingested roughly the same amout - 5 or so mushrooms of a medium to smallish size, plus some extra stems and peices of the caps.", "Within the hour, Everything started to become so bright and beautiful, colours were so pure in their intensity and the inner joy and peace i felt was literally undescribable. wilst colours were bright and beautiful, it had the look as though there was a softening filter on everything i saw, and my female companion looked so raidiant and her movements were soft and slow like a very gentle stream, i had so sence of time as i felt transported to a higher spiritual heaven where i could conect with my deepest fears and pain and cry like i never have before and also really get in touch with the beautiul and treasured things in my life.", "For one of the few times in my life i felt truely honest and for 6 or so hours really thought about so many things with a clarity beyond my normal abilitys.", "it truely was so intencely spiritual but completely real as I learned and learned and learned. The main thing that struck me on both occaisions was the absalute clarity of my thoughts and feelings. It was truely a BETTER reality - not just a different one as i have felt with all other drugs i have taken. and afterwards I can recall evrything and i have benefited greatly from the experience and have nothing but the utmost respect for life and its possible beauty, i feel renewed as if my dreams are acheivable and my past has been shed away.", "all in all, i have not experienced anything like it, nor have I had a negative reaction from it though i know the rest of my friends have.", "Before I start the story off, I'll fill in some background information. I have consumed mushrooms on multiple occasions previously, and although my experience with psychedelics is limited solely to psilocybin, I don't consider myself an inexperienced tripper.", "I recently aquired a quarter of an ounce of some very potent mushrooms. The stems were longer than any I'd ever seen before (about 5-6 inches dried.) The caps were also very large and a lighter golden color than the mushrooms that are usually around this area. There was also the occasional gold flake on the caps and stems.", "At around 3:20 or so my friend and I both consume an eighth, washing the shrooms down with some oj. We chill for a while, listen to some music and then decide to walk to a nearby store. On the way home I can feel the mushrooms kicking in, that familiar body high taking over my body. We decide to go for a cruise and smoke a few bowls of some very high quality sativa. We drive by the beach and are mesmerized by the waves and magnificent pink sunset. We smoke a fat joint of the same kind bud.", "I'm getting intense visuals but still feel fit to return home and make some phone calls. My mother's home and listening to some book on tape, which kind of freaked me out because I didn't know where these strange voices were coming from. We go upstairs and listen to some mp3s. My eyes are more dilated than I've ever seen them, so much so that I can barely stand to look at the monitor because it's hurting my eyes. everything is distorted and I start to get a little worried. I hear my father's voice downstairs and realize he just got home from work. I tell my friends that we gotta get out of there. I shut down the computer and we prepare to go. This is when things start to get weird. By my guess it is about 5:40 or so, maybe six.", "I walk to the bathroom and then forget why I went there. I come back into the room and for some reason I cant tell if I just puked. I ask my friends and they say no. My face feels funny and my teeth seem extremely sharp when I run a finger inside my mouth. I realize I'm starting to freak out. A million thoughts start running through my mind and my head starts to feel extremely heavy. I'm standing up holding a bottle of Sprite, next to the half-open door. Next thing I know I'm down on the ground and stumbling back up, after I have crashed into the door, knocked over a speaker and spilled my soda all over the floor.", "I hear voices downstairs asking what the noise is about. My friends dont believe whats happening and ask if I'm alright. I rush into the next room over and try and sit on my bed, only to fall down on the floor once more, this time making a huge crash as I hit the wood surface knees first. My parents come running upstairs, my father yelling about the commotion. He can tell by the size of my pupils that I'm on some kind of drug. He asks me what I've done and what I'm on and tells me to level with him. I deny everything and then my sister shows up and tells him to go away.", "I tell my sister to keep the parents away from me and lay down on the bed. My head feels tiny and my arms seem like their extremely long. The skin on my hands looks groutesque, almost like it's melting. My friends sit in silence, watching me. I reassure them I'm not falling asleep and that I just have to lay down. We sit for a long time, they try to entertain themselves by drawing. My saliva seems very thick and it feels as though my throat is closing up. Its difficult to swallow. The whole time I'm getting intense visuals- I look at my friends face and can only see the outline, I cant make out any of the features of his face. The light hurts my eyes so bad I have to keep them closed.", "I ask my friends what exactly happened earlier and they say I just hunched over and fell to the floor, with my eyes WIDE open the whole time. They're scared shitless, as am I. I get my friend to put on some music, which thankfully was some great reggae on a wonderful radiostation, WERS 88.9 in Boston. We sit or a long time, I'm just staring at the wooden floors and door which have the characteristic breathing effect to them. After about an hour and a half the visuals finally go away. I tell my friends that I can finally see normal again. They tell me color has returned to my face and I know then that it's over.  We try and come to terms with what just happened and we agree it must have been a panic attack. My brain hurts. Eventually they leave and I just lay on my bed in the darkness, with the radio on to maintain my sense of reality. I fall asleep and slept soundly.", "This all happened yesterday, and to me was a wake up call. It scared me and made me realize just how powerful psychedlics are. I can't say I'll never do shrooms again but knowing what happened I'm pretty sure I will never experiment with any stronger psychedelics (ie acid , pcp).", "The other day i did shrooms for my second time, but in all truth it completely blew away the first time. It started out when my friend gave me a gram of shrooms (really good ones) right before 1st period, and said to just take them. I had a short mental debate over whether or not I should take them, and then just did it. I hadn't had any breakfast, so the effects started to set in pretty quickly. By +30min I was already fully into the coming up stage. Time seemed to drag on forever, and minutes seemed like hours. I was so messed. the projection that my teacher was showing us started to warp and bend, and peoples faces were stretching and starting to melt a little. The time kept dragging horribly and I started to wonder 'what have I done to myself?'. I thought I was gonna die, and since the room was dark, my visuals were pretty heavy and I almost freaked out once or twice. By the time 1st period was ending I was done coming up and was full on trippin'. I wasn't prepared for what was coming next.", "After a long walk throught the halls, I got to the locker room and dressed out for PE, and went to the gym. I talked excitedly to people for a while (that reminds me, my jaw was tightly clenched and aching). I sat down and let the teacher take role, enjoying my trip. Then we started by doing some calestenics, and moved on to an activity called form running. This i where it became interesting. We started running in different styles and the sound of peoples footsteps and voices and weird noises and even their actions became a sort of inexplicably beautiful music, so beautiful I became completely enthralled with it, obsessed with it. We went through form running, and started playing dodgeball (my friend had to help guide me through it). I became increasingly interested with my closed eye visuals (it was too brite in there for strong open eyed visuals, beside extreme warping in the bleachers and the wood floor, and seeing people threefold.).", "I saw something like a shoe-print crossed with a dollar sign and made up of little metallic orbs and colorful liquid. However, my most memorable vision was of two, two-dimensinal, aztec-like heads made of a brown kind of stone. they were built into a seemingly endless wall. The two faces were conjoined, in the way that one's mouth formed the other one's brow. I can still see this image in my head, but I can't quite describe it, the way they were conjoined, it bent space in a way. The rest of the day was pretty typical after gym, besides the fact that I couldn't concentrate very well. It was a great learning experience, and I plan to repeat it within the week. Thanks for listening to me babble on.", "where to begin...in high school i had tried mushrooms but they became so confusing i really knew nothing of their effects and purpose.  i have done lsd in the range of forty to fifty times and i got to the point where the severe backaches and intense felling of crappiness the next day were getting old.  so, i asked a friend of mine if he knew where i could get some caps and he came through the next evening...", "well then i proceeded to go to the store...i bought a huge bottle of hawaiian punch, hoping to kill the dastardly taste of mushrooms, then went home and made a lengthy boil of my cherished newly purchased ten caps.  ", "i then took the thick purplish-black mixture and added it to half a pitcher of hawaiian punch and got a medium sized glass to fill... then i drank the glass and thankfully the punch had done its job.  no poopoo taste.  ", "i turned on the stereo and put in my favorite new cd Tori Amos' To venus and Back...and waited but not for too long.  after about 45 minutes i began to feel calmly elated... sounds funny but you know what i mean.  i was so happy and resolutely calm.. such a nice departure from my hectic job...", "then i began to see things unlike any acid venture. things more realistic, less frightening. the whole room i was sitting in due to the glare from the only lamp in the room began to ice over in a sheer but noticeable way.. it was if the walls were the surface of a pond and i was inside but outside of the water.  visuals of this nature and many others ensued for several hours and then i realized that not only were the open eye visuals amazing... but closing your eyes brought about things even more stunning.. i could see stars and the surface of saturn and the red storm on jupiter and many other sci-fi related visuals.", "i had tori's album on repeat and the song datura came on for about the fifth time and it finally hit me... i opened my eyes and to my surprise it had become daylight outside and i quickly jumped up to claim a space out on the porch swing.  i could see the plants outside moving in the breeze at first and then the wind stopped blowing but they didnt.  they seemed to undulate along with the song and swirl as if they were mevlevi dancers.", "but then i began to regain control with visuals and from then on it was more of a relaxant than anything.  it was very calming and i didnt experience any horrible side effects, except for being generally out of sorts for a few days following. i highly suggest that if you have a stereo with speakers surrounding the room.. get to venus and back and you will not be disappointed.  i a now a huge fan of mushrooms and will continue to enjoy the wild experience i had.", "Recently, a friend of mine informed me that he knew someone who just got in a huge supply of mushrooms. So we, as well as my boyfriend, decided to shroom during the weekend at another friend's house. When we got the mushrooms, my boyfriend and I split an eighth and my friend had an eighth to himself (he's a big guy...). We decided to make them into a tea since I had never tea'd mushrooms before. When the tea was ready, we drank it down (around midnight) and smoked a little weed. Well, I soon discovered that mushroom tea kicks in very fast, as opposed to just eating them. When mushrooms are eaten it takes roughly 30 minutes to an hour to start working. With the tea, it was only about 10 minutes or so before I was tripping. It started off a little weird... ", "I kept looking over at the couch to stare at the patterns on the couch. Were they moving...? I couldn't tell... I wasn't sure if the mushrooms were already working or if I was just really stoned or if I was psyching myself out in anticipation of the trip. I started to feel all numb and silly and I started at laughing at things that weren't really funny. I also started shivering... For some reason I always get really cold right before I start tripping on shrooms or ecstacy. About 15 minutes after drinking the tea, I was rolling around on the couch, not sure what to do with myself. I was a nervous wreck! Confusion set in quite heavily and my brain was racing. The walls turned pink and these green wormy-looking things were dancing around.. The room was growing and shrinking but I couldn't concentrate on any one thing for too long. Some other guys who were there (who were not shrooming, just stoned) were watching Swan Lake on tv. The colors and all the dancers moving in unison were just too much to look at. The music was also affecting me. When the music would climax dramatically, my hallucinations went right along with the music. At one point, I went to explore the bedroom but left when nothing really caught my interest. As I walked back out into the living room, I must've entered at a dramatic point in Swan Lake because the music swelled in a threatening manner. It was very frightening and I ducked, covering my head and looking around nervously. Apparently, everyone in the living room found this rather amusing because they all started laughing at me. ", "I had to move to the kitchen where the music wasn't as loud. There, I stared at the broom which had a very dark, sadistic quality about it... It made me nervous... and one of the guys who wasn't shrooming, decided to mess with me and dangled a measuring tape in front of my face while I stared at it, confused. I could not figure out what it was! Once I did realize, I collapsed onto the floor in a fit of laughter. I never felt so out of control... It was as if I was watching myself act in this bizarre manner and I couldn't do anything about it. My boyfriend shortly discovered the evil broom as well and stared at it with wary eyes. My friend who was teasing me with the measuring tape, decided to mess with my boyfriend by picking up the broom and chasing him into the bedroom. Once again, I broke down into helpless laughter. ", "Soon my friend, my boyfriend and I all went out into the big backyard. Nature is incredibly beautiful on mushrooms... I was walking on the grass, watching vines grow, twisting gracefully out of the ground and wrapping around everything. The rose bushes glowed as if they were electric and trees and leaves were huge and exaggerated, looking very much like something out of 'Alice in Wonderland'. I couldn't resist touching the roses and once I did, they fell apart so easily in my hand. It looked as though the petals were turning into liquid and melting into my hand. I walked to the very corner of the yard where these thick bushes met at an angle. I stared into the bushes and I swear I heard a voice calling me into the darkness. The branches seemed to beckon with their thorny fingers and I went running back into the safety of the house. ", "Back in the house, the living room looked like a jungle. Vines and flowers and leaves were growing like crazy from every angle! The tables and chairs looked like trees and the whole room emitted this tropical orange glow. It was insane... I felt like I was going insane because my mind was still racing. Things were just going by so fast, I almost couldn't handle it. So I took refuge in the kitchen and found a wonderful companion...my friend's dog. She had this positive energy all around her and her warmth and friendliness instantly eased my discomfort. I spent a long while petting her and tripping out on her fur. I even started crawling around on my hands and knees, following her around. Eventually I lost track of her and got really sad. I was gonna miss her... ", "So I made my way into the bedroom where I found my boyfriend tripping out on the designs on the comforter. I joined him. We had finished peaking a while ago and our minds were a little clearer. We were actually able to converse with each other, though the conversation didn't make a lot of sense... We were still feeling silly and laughing a lot. The other guys had gone home (It had to be nearly 3 am at this point) so the living room was empty. I went to put on some music... ", "In the living room, I stared at the 2 large cd cabinets packed full of cd's, searching for the Beatles. It shouldn't have been too hard since the cd's were in alphabetical order, but I was still hallucinating and the cd cabinets looked absolutely gigantic... it looked as though there were a billion tiny little cd cases all stacked next to each other. They were so small I couldn't even read the words on them! It took me several minutes to actually locate the Sergeant Pepper's album and put it into the cd player. It was worth it though... The Beatles are always great to trip on. I went back to the bedroom and watched patterns form on the ceiling and move in rythmn to the songs.", "Around 4 am, the three of us went out into the living room where we smoked more weed and sat down, subjecting each other to our drug-induced thoughts. I was STILL tripping a little..I watched the doors grow big and then small. I watched the walls breathe and the textures on the ceiling spin and change colors. Even when I closed my eyes, I couldn't escape from the hallucinations. Intricate patterns formed behind my eyelids until I grew bored and prayed I would fall asleep soon. Finally around 5 or 6 am, the weed was putting us to sleep and my boyfriend and I retired to the bedroom where we slept until noon. ", "Overall it was a pretty good trip. Although, next time I'll stick to eating the mushrooms instead of making them into a tea. The tea made everything go by too quickly, basically packing an entire mushroom trip into a one hour peak. I like to take my time with mushrooms... ", "I injected 14 oz of Psilocybe mushrooms mixed with Ketamine, RQQ,   4-9-N-AA, raw weevil larva and newt kidneys.  I swear I saw the bloody ghost of Jerry Garcia frolicking obscenely with a swarm of dryads in the woods.  ", "This is the real trip (it's not quite as exciting): ", "This was my second time tripping on mushrooms, but my first time doing it alone.  I was listening to Paul Simon's 'The Boy in the Bubble' from Graceland.  I heard the line 'Every generation sends a hero up the pop charts' and it seeded the entire trip.  I took my dog to a field near my house and kept thinking about the line.  It occurred to me that it didn't refer to twentieth century popular music, but to the Heroic Tribal Chants that exist in most cultures (Gilgamesh, Odyssey, etc.)  Somehow this led backwards to include dominant forms of life at various times in natural history.  I thought about the DNA-RNA chain which had acted as architect for all forms of life from the dominant simple bacteria to the less-dominant but more complex vertebrates and flowering plants.  We are all a part of one chain - I thought as I viewed hundreds of species of plants, animals and fungi and considered the unseen millions of invisible organisms all around and in me. For the first time in my life I perceived an intelligence inherent in nature.  Not a sentient, egotistical god like in the monotheist religions, but nevertheless an intelligence, which is the closest I ever hope to come to a religious experience.", "We now return you to the imaginary but more interesting trip in progress: ", "I was chased my Nazi Leper Cops until I fell into the River Styx, blissfully forgetting everything. I ended up in a psychiatric ward for 7 months after having my stomach pumped by a satanic Vulcan nurse.", "Last night, this morning,  most beautiful cleansing roller-coaster of horrible existential confusion and then complete hilarious ecstasy........5.5 grams of mushrooms dosed at 11pm.......within half an hour I cant even see......within an eternity the patterns and tangles of the universe of skull (mine, All) writhe and dance, torturing me, exploding and spinning in floral insane connundrum.  Visionary voices and faces twist me from side to side as the struggle to crawl up the kundalinic frame is burned up and blown away in the wind of the dance party of Mind.

This is the passion of non-passion.  Its LEAPING GLEAMING  LOVE.", "Having tripped on mushrooms several times in Amsterdam I decided try my hand at growing my own. The results were initialy dissappointing, One medium sized 'shroom and two very small ones, far less than I was used to dosing myself with. I assumed that the experience would be dissapointing, and though I had promised to share with a friend I almost didn't, thinking that there was barely enought for even one person. The result was a horror that I thought would never end. I'm incredibly thankful that I did not go into it alone.", "We started by blending the 'shrooms with some orange and measuring out equal doses, a mistake since I was on MAOI inhibitors and should have had half as much as my friend. After consuming this foul brew we sat down to watch the movie 'Little Nicky' and wait for something to happen. Another mistake, watching a movie full of demons and such, even if it was a comedy. In very little time we were both tripping harder than we ever had and looking forward to the rest of the night. My friend wanted to go out and get an unlimited ticket and just ride the trains, I briefly argued that I didn't think I could function outside, but I eventually struggled into my coat and we set out for the train stop. On the way there a small voice in my head started whispering about poisonous mushrooms, but I was still having a good time so I ignored it.", "We got on the train and went on the ride of our lives, at this point it was still fun and the train seemed like the great space coaster moving through the universe. We got off in unfamiliar territory, and that was when we entered hell. I started to take that little voice seriously, and I really believed I was dying. When I told my friend this he tried to persuade me otherwise, but I was convinced. The only thing I was unsure of was the means of death. For a while I was being slowly killed by a madman, for a while my body was melting, for an eternity I was at the bottom of the ocean seeing the stars through the water as I drowned. I went through many other deaths, none of them painful, but the raw fear was unbearable. I remember in between deaths running through an unknown town. Heedlessly crossing the street as cars came on, one time clinging to some metal object as my friend tried to talk me across an otherwise empty street.", "I remember running through brush and thinking the trees were tearing me apart, and later struggling through some sort of muck until I though it was the only thing I had done for my entire existence. I finally found myself in an empty field, covered in mud, and repeating nonsense phrases over and over while staring at some shiny metal on the ground. My friend had dragged me some way, as I had finally given in to death and refused to do anything on my own. He tells me that he tried to kill me several times, partly because he thought I had deliberately poisoned us both, and partly because he no longer felt like convincing me to live. His own story is very different from mine as he believed we had descended to hell and what was muck for me was decomposing bodies for him. In his belief that I had killed him he deliberatley shit himself several times to ensure that when his body was found it's filthy state would show the world what I had done to him. In the end he found his way back to me (I can't imagine how) and pulled me out of the my loop, by picking the shiny metal up off the ground and saying 'Here they are.' as I repeated to myself for the millionth time 'Where the fuck are my keys?'. I'm thankful for that empty field, far away from anything that I could use to hurt myself. My friend and I spent the next hour or so looking for the train stop we had gotten off at, only to find that the next train didn't run for several hours.", "And there we stood, in the middle of nowhere, covered in filth, freezing, and repeating to ourselves how lucky we were to be alive. Thank god for cell phones and GPS equipped taxis. As long as this story has become, I've left out more than I could possibly tell you. The fear of that night occasionally leaks over into my daily life and I have to convince myself all over again that it wasn't real. Ordinary life often seems like it's the hallucination to me now, though both effects are fading with time. Still, would I do it again? I already have, but thats another story.", "With summer dragging on and on, and our living rooms becoming one of the few cool sanctuaries available to us, we decided to perform some 'communing with the other' this weekend.  Having 'attempted' to quit smoking with my girlfriend, T, Wednesday night after the GbV show, my nefarious, nicotine-stained habit was definitely still in mind (and between fingers, unfortunately), especially as our tandem failure to 'slay the dragon' became more apparent with each day, each moment that passed. Anyway, Saturday night came, and after C got home from work, we brewed up some tea. My own glass contained about 3-3.5 grams of the 'wittle boo monstahs,' and the others' doses were right around this amount, too, give or take a gram.  Exchanging excited glances across the dim, candlelit room, we drank, and then sat back, waiting for as C likes to put it, 'the field to come down.'", "It began after about 20 minutes, with a realization that there were now giant shadow insects, 'grasshoppers of the ether,' if you will, inhabiting the living room ceiling above our heads.", "'Look at those shadows!' exclaimed someone, an observation which at the time set off a wave of drunken panic in my mind, as in, 'Oh, shit, I'm piss drunk and stranded and how am I going to get home now?' This I recognized as the first pangs of fear and frustration from my ego as it realized it was about to take leave of itself, AND ME, for a while.", "It was at this point that the tremors began, first in my thighs, and then continuing up into my stomach and back, as the first quantities of psilocybe snaked their way through nerve endings. 'I think I want to lay in my bed,' I heard myself saying, which was strange, because the bed was T\u2019s not mine, and I usually referred to it as 'the bed' rather than as a personal possession: this was a brief and minor detail, but sticks with me now for some reason.", "C said something like, 'I'm not moving\u2026  They get you when you close your eyes...That\u2019s when that thing threw that lightning bolt at me last time.'", "I wasn\u2019t sure if I knew what he was talking about, but I was feeling fairly certain at this point that I didn't need to hear his spiel at this time in my own trip, as it was just coming on, and I was feeling very weird myself right then.", "In fact, it was when C said something like, 'You're either gonna go through it with your eyes open or your eyes closed - and I\u2019m keeping my eyes open.' and began to talk again about the entities with lightning bolts that I felt a strange urge, and exclaimed, 'It's official: I am FEELING IT.' It was official. I was going to bed.", "By the time I made it back into the bedroom and lay down, the tremors had begun to turn into actual shakes, and were starting to make me nervous.  Almost as soon as my head hit the pillow, though, I heard a strange voice say something to the effect of, 'You can relax now - it's just your stomach. It'll be all right.'", "Huh? I wondered to this strange voice, and then relaxed almost immediately when I focused my eyes to the darkness both in the room and in my head, and saw them. Everywhere were tiny jeweled, spider or elf-like creatures: floating through the air, crawling the walls, roaming the nether regions of my skull. I raised my hand in the dark and it was awash in these small, shimmering hyper-organisms. ", "It was at this point that my conversation with them began. By this time, the trembling having subsided, I noticed the knot in my stomach tightening, an uncomfortable feeling to be sure. I thought I might be getting sick from the mushrooms or some thing: the feeling of taking that last soggy, chunky gulp of tea now came back to me, and this intensified my sick feeling.  Fortunately, they began to speak again.", "'Y'know that you\u2019re not feeling sick, not really anyway,' they said.  'The feeling you are feeling is the truth of your existence; we are showing you what is at stake here in this life, what you have done and are doing wrong, and what you must do to feel better...'", "(At this point, I noticed the colors of the entities more closely - they were red, blue, yellow, purple, and gold, as well as other colors which I cannot name here now; I also noticed that they spun clockwise and all together at one point, and then in beautifully syncopated patterns at another.  With Tortoise and Bardo Pond playing softly on the radio, I realized that the music was triggering an intensification of my interactions with these hyper-beings. As the music got softer and clearer, so did the beings; as it got louder and more dissonant, the beings seemed to back off into the darkness, and the 'psychedelic drunk' feeling came back like gangbusters.)", "Anyway, the beings then clued me into what was going on inside of me: the pain and discomfort I was feeling and associating with the mushrooms or with digestion or something, was in fact the pain my spirit was feeling because of my smoking habits.  The beings explained quite simply to me that smoking cigarettes was a waste of my time, energy, and most importantly, my life, and by continuing in this behavior I was perpetuating cycles of fear, greed, and disease which reached both through and beyond time and space (at least as we commonly know them). I realized that what the beings were trying to clue me into was that my smoking was supporting the dominator culture that persecutes the mushroom, its 'children', and all of us as well; while some of my discomfort was no doubt the result of the actual physical act of smoking, my spirit was in pain too, it was obvious to me now.", "'What to do, what to do?!?' I wondered as I lay in bed.", "'We will show you,' they said back almost immediately.", "At this point, the entities changed appearance again, turning into bluish, gold bits of light, less defined than before, and proceeding to 'paint' whatever it was I looked at; I say 'paint', because that\u2019s what it looked like- paint flowing onto various surfaces (although the most beautiful paint I'VE EVER SEEN!!!) as I passed over them with my gaze.", "(At this point in our story I feel it necessary to inform the reader that I've made my living as a housepainter for the last several years; the source of this paint imagery..?)", "I started to get the feeling that the ghostly painting going on in my room was surrounding me in some strange way; I didn\u2019t feel threatened, as I realized this pent-up feeling I was beginning to develop sitting there in the dark was simple ego-dissolution.  The color-beings began to multiply and crowd around me almost as soon as I realized what I was feeling.  'We will take over from here,' or words to that effect, were pretty much the last thing I heard from these beings that night. Almost as soon as I\u2019d heard this hyper-dimensional message, the painted surfaces began leaping off of themselves and congregating in the air, casting off a strange blue glow.  As this fuzz ball of psychedelic energy materialized, I felt it start to cover me, as if it were a ghostly sheet covering my deceased body in the morgue or something; strangely, I felt no fear, dread, or even much discomfort as this thing, this shroud of or by or from these hyper-dimensional space aliens, covered me, wrapping me like a newborn child...A NEWBORN!!!", "A non-smoking newborn. 'Hmmm,' I thought to myself after laying there a while longer. The elf shroud blanket had vanished, as had most of the space aliens. My hallucinations became less coherent staring into the dark, and for the first time since laying down, I noticed the sound of other voices coming from the other room.  Then, T walked in to see if I was OK, and I could tell by the look on her face that she too was 'feeling it'.  Also realizing how thirsty I was, I decided to return to the living room and the others. The entire experience in the bedroom had lasted less than a half-hour.", "We stayed up for a few more hours talking, raving, and tripping, until it became time to quiet down and retire to the wispy comforts of sleep; C and S left, taking much of the past hour\u2019s heavy conversation with them, thankfully. T and I got into bed almost as soon as they left. I talked to her about what I\u2019d experienced as we lay there, and then noticed that I was putting her to sleep. So be it. I decided to shut up, and closed my own eyes, content to fall into the lull of the transdimensional laser light show still playing (although much more dimly than before) in my head.", "Looking back, I am definitely of the opinion that the psychedelic drunk trip I had was due to high levels of psilocybe in the mushrooms; C and S (esp. C) seemed to be having a much more visionary, cerebral trip, like that from mushrooms higher in psilocin (we had eaten two different batches) than I was anyway, and some of C\u2019s words after I returned from the bedroom struck me as having a distinctly visionary flavor to them; as T and S's smaller doses began to wear off, and my own as well, it seemed to me that C's conversation, both the speaking and listening of it, were directed by or at something entirely 'other' than the rest of us in my living room.", "I'm sure C will relate this to the rest of us as indicative of us not 'taking an active dose,' and therefore not having a true visionary experience.", "I don't know about all that, and don't really care much either, especially not being directly affected by such theorizing: I know what I saw, felt, etc., that night and I now feel more ready than ever to take on the dominator cancer plant that has been my master for going on ten years now.", "As C said during our living room rave-session, 'This stuff is powerful medicine!!!! It can cure smoking, or IT CAN CURE CANCER!!!'", "After that night, I'm inclined to believe this more than ever.", "The night began when one of my friends just decided, spur of the moment, that we should take some mushrooms we had left over from another trip. Being completely unprepared I was a little bit nervous. Normally I like to mentally prepare myself for what I might see or feel a little bit before hand. But, at about 8:20, we ate the mushrooms with some chocolate cake. Not very much longer (maybe 20 minutes to a half hour) they started to kick in. I live in residence at a university and none of my companions could handle the overwhelming colour of yellow or the musty smell so we decided to go for a walk.", "I hope this doesn't get too cheesy. Even when I am not stoned I feel an affinity for trees and the earth but that night was a  culmination of that. Under a moon slightly hidden by clouds we went to a little forested area with ponds, fountains, a giant pagoda like building, and perfectly sculptured trees all around us. It was magical.", "Sitting on the ground for a bit I started noticing the earth breathing in time with me. In fact I could feel my entire body as an extension of the ground and the earth around me. My friends and I dispersed through this little wonderland and found things to occupy ourselves with. For me it was the trees. All around me the branches swayed and danced. As I saw the moon breaking through the clouds and lighting the pond I attained a clarity I doubt I will ever repeat. Everything made sense. I understood that for centuries people had looked at the same moon; they had walked on the same ground. I even gained an insight into my friends and felt a love for them impossible to describe even now. Without saying a word to them I felt I understood them and, in part, all of humanity and it's place in the world. I could feel the love and the warmth emanating from the trees around us. I thought back to some of the books i have read on buddhism and tried to place what I was feeling and gain some insight but instead of thinking all I did was let go and breath. I felt I could breath deeper, think clearer.. hell, i could do anything. But all I did was sit on a bench surrounded by trees and BE. I let the wind rush through my hair, my hands rest in my lap, and I had one of the best 'trips' I have ever had.", "I don't know what I took away from the experience except for a glimpse of the calm I felt. I can't remember the answers I came up with to the world around me. I can't see the unity when I look at the moon anymore. But what I can do is look back to that park and that night and know that I experienced something magical.", "In my area shrooms are a little tricky to come by.  I had wanted to eat some shrooms for about 2 years and could never get them.  Then finaly last weekend my friend gives me a call out of the blue and was wondering if I was intrested in a half oz of some dank shrooms.  Jumping at the ocation I said YES! and ran up to my buds house asap.  ", "I checked everything out and everything looked pretty good.  So I threw the money at him and got ready to eat :)  I heard fasting befor your trip can really help.  But I had no idea I was going to get any mush that day so coudln't really plan much ahead.  So I called up a couple of my friends that I knew were looking for shrooms the whole time I was and we got together at my house.", "I choose my house because my house is more like a crash house.  When someone needs a place to crash you can come to my house.  It is just a warm cozy place and I knew everyone would feel comfertable there.  So we each took our share of the shrooms and ate away.  Let me tell you... Waiting all that time for something that tasted so bad was a mistery to me ...  But I knew it would be worth it in a few hours.  ", "Prior to eating shrooms I had experimented with a few other types of drugs.  Pot, GHB, MDMA, LSD, Coke, Opium, DXM, and couple other chemical breakdowns my friends have come across.  ", "After everyone had finsihed there meal we sat around talking about what we had done on our day and we were going to do tonight.  After about 45 mintues we figured the booms would start to kick in soon and agreed it would be fun to go smoke some pot.  We went out side on a nice crisp febuary friday night.  We all smoked some buds and sat around relaxing and I started to notice the lights outside having a extra sorta glow.  And more and more things had much more color then befor.  Befor I knew it I was starting my wonderful journey....", "Of cource with only a half oz of shrooms not a bunch of poeple could eat.  So we had a couple designated drivers driving us around showing us things on the road.  Or as it seemed that way.  We stoped  at a few differn't spots were our friends hung out.  Visited for a while and laughed for about 2 hours.  It was much fun.  I don't remember what we were laughing about, all i remember is that is was very fun.", "My bud and I decided to go back to my house early and spend the night there.  We sat around listing to music.  Playing with my turn tables and the new records I had gotten earlier in the day.  Then about 4 hours into my trip my arms started to itch.", "My legs started to itch also.  It didn't really bother me just kinda got annoying after about 10 minutes.  Then finally I looked down and I had a bunch of red spots that were starting to bump up.  I had no idea if I was triping or if they were really there.  Which started to get me scared.  By then the itching was unbearable.  I had no idea if I was triping or it was real.  I had my friend come over and tell me if he saw any thing strange on my arms and he said yea !! All over your arms you have these bumps. Then he started to draw with a pen were the bumps were.  Then I knew something was wrong.  I  didn't want to freak out I tryed to stay as calm as possible and enjoy the trip.  So I just got in my bed and listened to some shoothing music and stayed up the rest of my night with my friend talking about anything we thought off.  About 9 hours after eating them.  We were both pretty much not tripipng any more and decided to get some sleep.", "In the morning when I woke up I right away jumped up and checked my arms.  Nothing was there.  I was very relived and went and got some breakfast from wendys. While in the car I started to itch on my arms and my legs again.  Not even thinking about the night befor I went ahead and itched.  Finally when I got home they were the big red bumps that I saw while i was triping.  I got some cortaid from the store.  And rubbed the on the bumps for a while.  It stoped the itching very well.  ", "Over the next couple days I relized that I must have had a alergic reaction to the shrooms which made me break out into hives.  Because  over the rest of the weekend I broke out about 5 more times.  Now it is thursday and I havent broken out in 2 days.  Which is a very good sign.", "Even though I did have a experience like that.  I did enjoy my trip.  It was very fun and was everything plus more that i excepted would happen.  I will shrooms again but I think im going to wait untill alergy season is over :)", "I visited Puerto Rico for 10 days with my girlfriend, and took along a bag of shrooms hidden in my underwear.  The precaution was somewhat uncomfortable, as well as thoroughly unecessary.", "Anyway, after several days of meeting my girlfriend's extended family and blissing out on Puerto Rico's astounding natural beauty, we decided to take our stuff and visit a rainforest.  We ate the shrooms straight (chasing each bite with onion rings from Burger King - it was a GREAT combination), and began feeling the effects about half an hour after dosing.", "By this point it was nearly inconceivable to navigate further with the use of a map, so we bailed on our plans to find El Yunque (the rainforest), and instead ended up driving about fifteen miles past it, by this fabulous public beach in the town of Fajardo.", "It had been raining earlier in the day (and would later rain again), so the beach was pleasantly deserted.  We were, in fact, the only two people to be seen.  WHen we first arrived, I sat on the hood of the car while my girlfriend went to use the bathroom, and watched several layers of clouds move discernibly across the sky.  There was plenty of stuff to look at in the sky (i.e., clouds, drifting paisleys, etc.), all of which was fascinating.", "Here comes the transcendental part....  So we walked into the water and splashed around a bit, and then came out and sat down under a palm tree.  I lay my head in my girlfriend's lap and stared up into the sky while she buried me in the sand.  We talked about our relationship (4 years), how happy we each are to have the other in our respectives lives, our mutual happiness at our recent career attainments, yadda da yadda da yadda....  I felt an intense sensation of belonging and joy.", "After my girlfriend returned to the water, I rolled over, face down in the sand, and lay my head on my arm for perhaps 15 minutes.  I prayed, thanking God/the Force/whatever for Her unfathomable blessings, and actually ended up crying my eyes out in sheer gratitude.  Words cannot describe the depth of my thankfulness, nor the effect it had on my emotional state.", "We ended up playing in the water for literally four hours afterward.  It rained again, and we had the immeasurable joy of experiencing it with no noise or distraction to detract from it.  Rain on the sea, believe it or not, sounds like a chorus of tiny bells.  Even stranger, the rainwater stays distinct upon hitting the sea; the drops coalesce into little beads and all run straight out away from the beach...as if they knew where to go before landing.  And the surface of the water when the drops hit was itself fascinating.  Not only where there countless ripples, but the entire surface of the water shimmered in the afternoon sun - which colored the sky a breathtaking series of reds and oranges to the west, gradiating into a placid violet to the east.", "Topping off the whole experience was the fascination of exploring the various plants beneath the water.  The beach extended for perhaps a quarter mile, and there were several distinct areas in which different kinds of plants were growing, not unlike underwater forests.  The afternoon cultivated a strong wish on my part to take up SCUBA diving.  If it's beautiful and calm on the surface, I cannot fathom how wonderful it must be underneath.", "Me and my friends a and k had planned on going to a party all messed up on shrooms.  We figured that we could each consume an 1/8th and still be aware of the natural world, we were wrong.", "We sat at my house and each consumed an 1/8th then k started to drive us to the party. Half way through the drive k and i looked at each other and asked if we had remember to bring a.  The shrooms had taken effect and we were just starting to notice.  A shadow had been cover up a in the back seat. So we both look back and dont see him.  We look at each other and decide to turn around.  As we start to stop he giggles, and says the winshield was melting.  Not even realizing that we were stopped we all look at each other and say in harmony what do we do?  Figuring out that we dont need to turn around we proceed towards the party again. Now let me tell you, riding in a car with a melting winshield is not exactly the best thing in the world. K had finally got us to the party and got out.  I was gettin out then a told me to make sure that there was no one outside. So i look around and say its clear and for him to come on.. . He looks out and says NO make sure no one is out there. Now for some reason it got to me and i was lookin around like hurry up there aint no one out here.  I tell him that no one is out here and to hurry up. ", "As he is gettin out i see k run down the stairs and straight into the woods. A gets out and runs in the woods, and i follow. I never found out why we all ran in the woods but i remember walking around trying to find reality. Me and a would knock on trees asking if reality was there. I dont remember where we went or what we did the rest of the night, i just know that it was the wierdest thing i have ever expreinced ever.", "Me and friend finally found our loved hallucinogen and took the dose at around 9:30pm while waited for food (which I never even ate). We both took the same dose basically. This was my second time and my friends third.", "As we were riding home I started to feel the first effects of the drug. I felt as if I was a changed person, or I wasn't the same me as I was when I wasn't on the drug, and I became really happy. When we got to a friends house the visuals starting to kick in about 5-10 minutes afterwards. Little things like slight pattern changes and objects getting slightly smaller/bigger, plus some color changes. The friend, we'll call him Goober, reported no visuals and that he just felt really great, almost like on ecstasy. My trip kept kicking in really really hard, I couldn't keep a grin off of my face and started seeing my friends skulls through their skin. Which made me crack up since I was tripping so hard. Everybody decided to sit down and watch a movie, The Matrix(bad move right there). I was still getting great visuals but starting to get a stomach ache that would come and go, some times really badly. Goober was basically going insane while my friends were messing with his head a little bit. He still reported no visuals.", "After about 2 hours of tripping I started to feel weird, really weird. The visuals became scary, for one a friend with a bear started to grow horns and became Satan that night. I also saw a green figure keep walking by and looking in the door from outside near where I was sitting. This continued to scare the shit out of me when all of a sudden, I couldn't feel my body any more. It wasn't an out of body experience, just, I couldn't feel my body. Every few seconds I would touch my stomach just to make sure it was still there. While all this was going on Goober still reported no visuals.", "Eventually this got so bad that I thought something was up with my stomach so I walked over to go outside just incase I had to throw up. As I walked over I thought I said 'I'll be right back' to my friends but afterwards they said it was just gibberish. As I opened the door and walked out, I can hardly remember anything. I fainted. The feeling was hard to describe, I felt like that I had to fight to get back into consciousness, when I came back it was in waves, like my soul was finally coming back into my body. When I regained consciousness I quickly got up and a friend said to lay on his bed.", "As I layed on the bed I was still hard to keep from passing out but I didn't want to for fear of not coming back. I would keep dazing out and just sit there staring. When realized I was doing this too much, I tried talking to get things off my mind which my friends were already trying to do. For a while I was pretty insane, I remember just spurting out words and sentences that didn't make sense. By the way, Goober still reported no visuals. Anyways at around 1:30am it finally started to go away. I could definately feel my stomach but my mouth was still not there, even tho I could talk. Visuals were still pretty insane except for the tv for some reason. Some walls were still trying to come at me but I ignored them since I was a little bit more sane now.", "At around 2:30am the visuals were gone, thankfully, god bless, it was over. I still felt weird after that but finally I could go home and rest without worrying. Since then I've decided that hallucinogens aren't my thing, and I've stuck to the x. I still dont understand how such a small dose was so potent. My first time I had taken several more shrooms and the trip was wonderful. But to me, bad trip risk's aren't worth actually tripping.", "A friend of mine is big up into drugs.  Anything on this planet, you name it, he's got it.  Anyway, he picked up a bunch of mushrooms, and me and 3 friends each bought 2 grams for ourselves.  Now, 2 grams might not seem like a lot, but as we were leaving, he told us to be careful.  He said that these mushrooms were 'fucking incredible.'", "About an hour later, we arrived at my friend's house and the second we walked inside, we all started grubbin' down the poison.  Well, they were kickers - they hit us before we were even done eating them.  I already had a nice body high and slight visuals, and so did everyone else.  We were all lying out on the deck, staring at the sky, smokin' some kind buds, just having a blast.  We all thought it was gonna be the best trip anyone could ever have, but shortly after that, everything went wrong.", "I always tend to get a little sick when I eat mushrooms, but only for a short time.  I knew it would pass so I just decided to go in and lie down.  The second I was by myself on the couch, my body went completely numb and all I could see were massive amounts of colored patterns zooming all over the place.  Then out of nowhere, it started to storm outside, which kinda sucked because we were all having a great time chillin' outside.  Now everyone was inside, tripping nuts, laughing our asses off, and then one kid wigged.  He started screaming stuff about Armageddon and how we need to praise the lord, and he was crawling around on the floor yelling out jibberish and whatnot.  That scared another kid and he freaked out and ran upstairs.", "By this time, me and the only other kid who were staying into reality were having the wildest trip you could ever imagine.  Me and this kid sat on the couch shaking, wondering what was gonna happen to all of us.  We had no clue these mushrooms were this powerful.  Everything I looked at was bouncing at me and sinking into the ground.  I couldn't shake the visuals for at least 4-5 hours no matter how hard I tried to...and this all happened not even an hour and a half after we ate them, so we knew that if it was already that bad, it would only get worse, and it did.", "The kid who was screaming had calmed down and was lying in the middle of the floor, staring at the wall.  He didn't move for at least 3 hours.  I went upstairs to see how the other one was doing.  He was sitting in a chair and looked like he was gonna start bawling.  He told me that he was having a really weird trip, and that he needed to go for a walk.  I tried so hard to keep him into reality and to keep him at the house, since it was storming outside, windy and very cold.  But before I knew it, he walked out the door.  ", "Me and my other friend tried to make the best out of things, before realizing that the kid who said he was going for a walk, wasn't coming back.  By this time it had been at least 2 hours since he had left, and we were still tripping pretty hard.  I know shrooms can fuck with your emotions, and it never happened to me, until I felt like I was sobering up.  So I turned on my cell phone and I had a message...from my girlfriend.  I gave her and her friend some mushrooms earlier that day.  All I heard on the message was her crying and telling me that I needed to call her as soon as possible, that she didn't know what was going on.  I tried to call the number she was at and I never got an answer (I eventually talked to her around midnight or so, 5 hours after eating the mushrooms, and everything was all good...thank god).", "Oh yeah...it's midnight, where the fuck is that kid?  Last thing I knew he was going for a walk and now he's been gone for 2 and a half hours?!  Me and the other kid decided that we had to look for him, no matter what.  So we go outside.  It's dark, it's raining, it's windy, there's lightning and thunder, and then BAM, visuals kicked it and my body high increased way up again.  We walked up the street only to find ourselves standing in the middle of a dark, deserted park.  We looked at each other and couldn't handle it.  We were too scared, so we headed back.", "It turns out that the kid who freaked out had probably sobered up, since he was lying on the couch sleeping when we returned.  We found out the next day that the kid who 'went for a walk,' walked home! (What a moron.)  So, we 3 sat there in the living room, smiling and staring at each other in disbelief.  What an experience.  And just for the hell of it, we ordered a pizza.  Turns out my friend had 4 more caps left, as he had bought more than the rest of us.  So we put them on the pizza and ate 'em.  Soon after that I had a cool little float feeling and my vision was blocked off by lots of pretty little colors dancing around the walls and ceiling.  ", "I wish I could've described this trip a little better, as I can't remember everything because...yeah, these mushrooms were THAT good.  Eating mushrooms like these makes me never wanna eat acid again, cuz if you can control it, then a mushroom trip is far better.", "Went for 4 days to the southern canyon lands of Utah. Found an isolated camping spot and spent the first evening setting up camp site 30 feet from cliff edge. Beautiful blond cliffs with red layers below me, blue soaring skies above. Eating light first night. ", "Up at sunrise. Fruit, nuts and water in pack, didgeridoo over shoulder, and off on a hike to get my body present in the new local. I have always found that walking, covering ground, and then napping midday to be a useful scenario for getting present in the local land's energy.", "Walked six+ miles down hill. Short break at around 2pm. Nap and didge playing in the crevices of the sandstone. Feeling more connected and open. The textures of the stone and grass and clouds are guide me into a more natural pace. Myedges are softening. ", "The six mile back up to the rim and my site was strong medicine. Arrived back at site for an exhausted nap and very light dinner. After dinner I wandered around and vibrated the lingering feelings of fear and loneliness. I have never taken the medicine alone in the wilderness. I feel strong in my intent to break through into another level of seeing tomorrow. no evidence of other people here.", "Morning. Just tea at my small fire pit. The pinon/cedar smoke is delicious. I set up the tent for ease of access and napping. Refilled water containers. Then mixed up the henna soup for painting myself. Using the small mirror and a smooth stick I patiently draw the lines, circles and spirals I feel are appropriate on my hands and arms and face. Making the intention real.", "By the time the henna has dried and is flaking off it is nearly noon. My skin hlds the designs lightly. The sun is hot but the breeze over the rim is nice and cool. It is time. I remove the medicine (dried mushrooms) from their bag. Line them up on the rug. Breathing deeply I take them one at a time. It is mid-morning to mid day. Although every time I do this it works... I always feel like nothing will happen this time. Weight unknown... a medium handful of stems and caps.", "They taste musty-good. I chew then thoroughly, mixing with saliva, and letting the essence enter me first through the membranes under my tongue. Then laying down and breathing deeply. Vibrating the anticipation outward. Staying present.", "Then the electric rushes begin to zing through my body and inner ear. I am seeing color tracers and auric rimming. Breathing it all in deeply. At this point the journey takes off and I feel the connection between that-which-is-looking-out-from-within-me and the surround. I move carefully through the desert rock pinon -scape. The silver-dried elder trees reach upward in wild patterns.", "Laying in the shade of a wide cedar, I feel the ground shudder and am letting go deeper and deeper into the Earth's frequency. I ask for healing. I intend transcendence of ordinary. I listen deeply. The rock layers shimmer and vibrate. All seems as it really is -totally alive. I walk slowly on being as being.", "Later I am laying in the tent, eyes closed, riding the energy washes. Just watching the land from the open door is deeply satisfying. I loose the thread of awareness-continuity here and find myself getting up to walk to find... something... something else. I keep looking to see the non-ordinary. Intending the miraculous.", "Then I am laughing at myself. The spaces I see and feel are all familiar. I have been here many times while journeying sans-entheogens. I am pleased that I can get to this state in other ways... And without the buzzy mushy shroom distraction. I thank the ally(s) for the journey and the medicine. I am grateful to Earth, Sky and the shimmering life everywhere.", "Later I feel both filled with connection and at the same time empty and quiet as the medicine runs its course. The sunset seems to take days to fade. I don't think about it, I don't analyze (ever notice that analyze is so anal?), I am just breathing being. Sleep comes easily and deeply.", "Morning is spent expressing, releasing, and receiving. I intend to open my receiving to glean all that I can from this quest. I see selfishness and addiction to preoccupation in my living. I see that I keep myself so busy I have no space to receive omens, guidance and overview in life. I see I must pause to break the continuity of the ordinary much more often. I receive this medicine. I intend expanded reality. I want communion with my people and deep ongoing connection with Intent. I move with this on the cliff top. I move and vibrate until I feel all this circulating in my body.", "Then its under the shade, on the blanket and letting go of limiting beliefs I have had. I change my reality and my path to integrate the seeing from yesterday and the morning. It is well.", "Later I break camp and drive home, strong with the desire for this new life.", "Through out my history of psychedelic use, I have never been as privileged as I have been recently. A few days ago, me and a friend imbibed some mushroom tea. About 45 minutes after initially drinking the potion, I began to feel the familiar body high. A light, wavy feeling in the extremities and a hallow feeling in the torso and abdomen. Eventually, the movie we'd put in ended and the other people (not on psychedelics, just MJ) went to sleep. We remained up until 4 or 5 chatting about life. We figured out some things about what everybody wants and what really happens out in the world, away from my or your little world. It was then when my trip took an unfamiliar turn. Suddenly I felt as if we had accessed a universal reality. By this I mean, we had, in our altered states of awareness, transcended rational thought and witnessed a universal truth) The truth can't be described with language, but rather experienced directly or not at all. I urge everyone to find their psychedelic of choice and trip with this in mind. LSD, DMT (which I've yet to try), Mushrooms, or combinations of these or other drugs which have no reasonable overdose level. Enter the trip with no fear of dying or going mad, realize it is the fear itself that will drive you mad, Overcome your fears by living right and treating people kindly. You will then be brave enough to see what it is that we all feel, but few understand.", "It was the summer before gr 11 and i had just gotten my own car.  It was time for a road trip.  Me and 5 other friends went to peach fest (an annual festival in penticton, bc, canada).  Peach Fest involved 10,000 young people going camping (or hoteling for the weaker)to a small town of interior BC and losing all inhibitions.  Nothing was planned except for tents, sleeping bags, a little food and some water.  ", "Before leaving one of my friends said he had some mushrooms to sell to me for $20.  He had had an incident a few months back on them that had him fighting a couple of friends, breaking down and crying like a little baby, and vowing to never eat mushrooms again.  I had smoked quite a bit of pot in my day, but mushrooms was something i'd always thought about trying and never did.  So I bought for $20 roughy 8 grams of muschrooms, one half of which had been crushed to powder sometime during that night he spoke of.  ", "We arrived in Penticton a little later than expected and luckily found a place to camp on the front lawn of a campsite owner.  After setting up the tent it was already 8 at night and it was time for something to be happening.  So i popped 7 grams of the mushrooms with some beer and waited for the effects.  Mushrooms were a foreign idea to me at the time.  7 grams didn't mean anything.  My friends who had some experience but very little didn't tell me anything about them or how much to take.  They thought i'd just aten a small palmfull.  I knew they made you hallucinate a bit, but that was all.  With some rum and daquiri mix (without ice and don't ask me why we were drinking it)  we headed to the strip of downtown penticton.  The mushrooms had begun to take effect.", "My stomach had been bothering me for about a half hour.  I thought it was just the terrible alchohalic mix i was drinking.  The first thing that hit me was confusion.  Where are we going? What are we doing? Why can't i find anything in my pockets?  I soon became very aware of the awkward materiel of the clothes that i was wearing.  What the hell is this shirt made of?  By the time we'd hit downtown (acually clock time had lost all meaning to me by now so i couldn't say exactly how long it was till i started peaking) i was beginning to peak.  ", "We all had our own seperate missions to complete before the night could get going.  I myself was already on my mission.  Finding out what was really happening to me.  I followed one friend while the other 3 split to get more beer.  I would later find out that splitting up wasn't a really good idea. I lost my friend within minutes.  A family coming out of a restaraunt asked me the time.  I must have looked like a psychopath when i looked up at them, and tried to figure out who they were and how did i know them?  Of course i'd never seen them before, but in this state i almost couldn't recognize myself.  So i just blurted out some inchorent statement about nothing, laughed, and continued on my way.  The pavement was no longer pavement, but a patterns on top of patterns of dead leaves sand and rocks.  ", "Suddenly i could hear the friend that i'd lost yelling for me.  So i started to yell for him because i couldn't for the life of me figure out what direction the yelling was coming from.  Later i learned that was becuase there was noone trying to call me.  Across the street something caught my eye that abruptly stopped my yelling.  A vided mural on the wall that was attemting to brithgten up the town was moving.  The technicolor trumpet player stepped away from the wall a bit and his trumpet was now pointed toward me.  Little people or something vaguely representing them in multicolors were flowing from the wall and crawling into the end of this mans trumpet.  I knew i was on mushrooms, but couldn't believe that it was just the drugs causing this surreal momment.  ", "Luckily for me my friend came by an unknown amount of time later and shook me.  I turned at him and asked him why he couldn't see what i was seeing and then he asked me how much of the bag i'd eaten.  I told him and he let me in on the fact that i'd eaten quite a lot compared to the norm and that was why i was hallucinating so much.  Then i asked him 'didn't we just have this conversation'.  I learned then too the de ja vu effect was also from the mushrooms and that we hadn't.  I would experience this several times before the end of the night.  ", "I soon lost my friend again and forgot where i was supposed to meet him and everyone else and at what time.  I soon found myself in what i thought was a graveyard (again don't ask me why) and fell down.  The sky had turned on me.  The clouds were forming words and scentences that i couldn't read against the starlit night sky.  Who was trying to speak to me, and what are they trying to say?  Then the biggest trip of all happened.", "One of the friends i went on  the trip with was a little person.  Wicked guy but you can never understand shit from him when he gets drunk.  So here i was lying on the gound and my midget friend steps over me and starts babbling about what i thought was a prophecy.  i started yelling, but soon calmed myself and tried to understand what the hell was happening.  It turned out i was lying on the front lawn of the town police station and had been laughing quite loudly for sometime with nobody around me.  ", "My bud lead me around the back of the cop station where some friends were drinking beer on a park bench.  I was sure the gig was up.  Cops had camera's on us and had just been collecting information.  Any minute swat teams were going to swing down from the trees.  Thankfully i was with a bunch of drunk but relativly sane people who set me straight.  All the police officers were out patrolling due to the usual problems they have with this festival every year.  ", "We headed to the beach and soon we were surrounded by people, most of them drunk and having a good time.  Myself on the other hand was having a hard time trying to figure out who's face it was on this giant peach.  It was actually a giant orange (those stands that serve drinks that was all closed up)  and it looked like it had a face that was raising it's eyebrow at me.  The sudden huge numbers of people was suprisingly not that hard to deal with, most likely because i knew somehow that they were all fucked and wouldn't notice me tripping in my own little world.  ", "The next few hours would be countless hallucinations and distortions that i kept having to clarify with my companions to make sure they weren't real.  It was definatly a night i will never forget.  Since i have tried many other varieties of mush rooms (in smaller dosages but still enough) although i still don't know what kind it was i did this paticular night.  I have also learned to research new drugs a little before doing them alhtough i must admit not knowing whats coming to you is a whole other trip. ", "It was my freshman year at college and my friend and I were seriously considering tripping shroom style.  The college I attend is dense with drugs and the like, so getting them was not an issue.  On the night of our foray into psychedelics, we made perfectly sure that all people that were not tripping with us were not around, and the select few that were, were in our dorm room with us.  It was time.  At about 7 o'clock in the p.m., we ate the mushrooms in hamburgers from Hot n Now, which is a restaurant frequented by college students simply for it's low prices-highly recommended.  About a half and hour to an hour later, my two friends and I were sitting on the couch, and all simultaneously burst out into laughter.", "We sat there laughing for about 20 minutes, about nothing.  We then went to our neighbors room and borrowed his strobe light.  We turned it on high, turned on number 6 from the Mortal Kombat soundtrack (i know, it sounds stupid, but when you hear the song you'll know why) Sitting there, smoking cigarettes, and listening to this intense music with the strobe light kicking was the single most mind-bending experience of the night....until we went outside.  The weather was incredible-it nearing the end of August.  We went on a walk to the local 7-11 to buy smokes because in a matter of hours we had all smoked a pack a piece.(like I say, smoking feels great) So on the way we went on a path that is now known as Disney Land, because of the vibrant colors on the trees and the lighting scheme.  It was unbelievable.  It is now our designated spot to visit when we trip.  All nature is good.  Frequent any woody area, or riverbank-type area, and you will be astounded by the things that you see.  They are things that you see everyday, but at the state that we were in, the most simple things seemed so complex and intricate.  We got our smokes, went back to the dorm, and it had seemed like we were only gone for 15 minutes, when in reality we were gone for about an hour.  ", "We stood outside playing hackysack for about 3 hours, and then went back upstairs where we listened to music, drew pictures, and smoked.  All in all, it was a very pleasant experience, and to all those that have the means, I say go for it.  It is all natural, I've heard VERY few bad stories about it, and the memories you have from it are unforgettable.  Some say it is life changing.  I just regard it as a great time, provided by mother nature.  So good luck, and happy shrooming. P.S. remember to have some kind budz on hand to burn soon after shroom consumption-it helps them kick in, or at least for us it helped.  peace.", "How happy I was to see the ecstatic faces of my 4 friends as I showed up with a big fat bag of mushrooms. The shrooms were something they had wanted for a long time, it being very very very boring living on an island. I had just managed to get a good deal on some great illicit merchandise, 1/2 oz. for 60 bucks. Immediately I was forced to split the bag into four small 1/8 oz portions for my insistent friends. ", "Only 3 of us decided to indulge that night (10pm). Nonetheless we immediately devoured the tasty little soldiers without any complaints, (usually hear 'these don't taste good....blah, blah'). In a few minutes all I had left was ~2 grams, half caps and half stems. My friends were excited and so we started having a good ole time as usual, quickly deciding to smoke a joint to waste some time. This took the usual 5-10 minutes and we were all sitting around, waiting for the effects of the psychedilic thrillers to kick in. Well, everyone except me, for patience is the virtue I have not yet mastered. ", "At 10:30 I splurged on the rest, and we all downed another stem, and then another cap for me. 10 minutes passed and another cap for me. By then I was hearing the telltale noises of satisfied, high people. Just starting to feel the effects myself, I decided to take one more, and another....woops whole bag was gone, the last 4 caps down my throat. ", "The night was grand, my other friend got completely toasted off of the whiskey, rum, vodka, etc. while the pyschedelic trio danced under the stars. We decided it was getting kinda late and that we didn't want to wake parents up with our shouts of 'This is so f#@$^* cool, man,' and accordingly we went back inside. The rest of the night and much of the morning went about the same; we had a great time. Then I left at 5am to go somewhere. Where you ask? I didn't know at the time, but all of a sudden my Geo had turned into a racecar. Every bump in the road was extravagant and exaggerated. I loved it, and even more so when I saw I was only going 30 mph. I ended up driving to the beach, where I saw the most magnificent sight ever. ", "Shrooms routinely convert the slightest never-before-noticed parts of nature into thrillers. The way the trees shake with the gentle wind urges you on, the sand on the beach flows in waves just as the ocean, everything seamlessly moves without ever really moving. It's like leaving your old life behind and looking upon the world with the eyes of a child, so pleased with so little. Fascinated with the magnificence of nature. ", "That morning, at approximately 6am, the sun rose over the waters of the Puget Sound, and I witnessed the most beautiful scene nature has ever produced. Wispy clouds, that seemed to flow in every way possible, changed colors as the sun shed its gaze on them. The waves reflected an infinite number of distinctly different shades of blue, gray, black, and white, all beautiful beyond words. 'Behold!!!' the sun bellowed as I took in the landscape as a whole and noticed the icy peaks of the mountains that engulfed the waters. I marveled at the utter perfection of nature as I watched the sun rise over the mountains and the ocean, through the light fog, shedding millions of magnificent colors to my still VERY dilated eyes. It was then I remembered that I needed to go home before my dad woke up. ", "I must mention, briefly, that I don't have a clue how I snuck in the house that morning without getting caught. My popz was up at 6:30am, and I could hear the coffee pot brewing on a Sat. morning as I carefully unlocked the front. Shoes already taken off, baggy pants in hand, I swept through the entrance, dining room, hallway, and into my room in the mere 5-10 seconds my dad went into his room. It must be worth mentioning that my dad knows EXACTLY what it means to have dilated, jumpy-ass eyes at 6am: an ass-beating. Luckily, I got into bed without incident, and quickly fell 'asleep'....yeah right, I was spun until that night. But as I lay there thinking at a mile a minute, I realized something. As much as I HATED living on an island for almost my entire life, I finally saw the extreme beauty in living there. My mind stopped for just a minute that morning to pay a tribute to nature.", "My first trip occurred at a deserted hiking/biking camp at a beautiful state park in the mountains in the early spring, about 5 years ago. I was alone, on a cross country solo mountain biking trip. I had never shroomed before. The day before, while riding deep in the forest along California's Lost Coast, I had encountered a scruffy, friendly backwoods mountain man/pot grower. It was in the morning, and he'd invited me over to his campsite and campfire for a cup of coffee. He was an amiable chap, though rough around the edges ('Me and cities don't get along too well'). He had a big, big, big, wolf-like dog, and showed me in his tent his sawed-off shotgun, stash of pot, and huge black garbage bag of shrooms. Anyway, when I resumed along my way, he sent me off with a couple of joints, and...about 2 grams of Psilocybin mushrooms, which, as I've said, I'd never tried (although I'd been using good pot for several years).", "I'd heard about 'bad trips', and had my share of mild 'bad trips' just on pot (high anxiety). My first time I'd really gotten stoned in elementary school I'd paniced and broken down and cried, but felt better after a few minutes. Ever since, though less and less, I still occasionally get very anxious in certain situations while stoned. And that was just pot. Shrooms were much more potent, from what I'd heard, even creating intense visual hallucinations. I was nervous. However, I'd heard that bad trips were much more common to LSD than shrooms, and I wanted to try them.", "The next day, having found a deserted, beautiful, meadow-like campsite in a grove of desiduous trees surrounded by coniferous forest, next to a beautiful rushing mountain river, I decided to take the day off from riding and eat the shrooms.", "I first ate one shroom, and started getting really nervous. After about 25 minutes, nothing had happened, so I'd calmed down. I then ate the rest of the shrooms. Then I really started getting scared. I knew I was going on a journey on which I had passed the point of no return. I'd never tried shrooms, before, so other than having heard a couple of other anecdotes, didn't really know what to expect. And here I was, out in the middle of the mountains, at least a day's bike ride to the nearest town, all alone. I was on the verge of panic, I thought maybe I should just pack everything up and start riding, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do. Finally, to ease my feeling of isolation, I picked up a notebook, walked over and sat down right next to a loud little waterfall in the river, and started writing a letter to my best friend, describing what I had done and how scared I was. This served to relax me a bit, and soon enough I realized around an hour must have passed and I still felt nothing. I felt relieved.", "At this point (+1), having calmed down, I went back to my campsite and sat at the old picnic table. I think I was still a bit nervous, and to help calm myself more, I picked up my harmonica and started playing it.", "A few moments later I saw something out of the ordinary which was the first manifestation of the drug in my experience. A tree across the meadow flush with small green leaves was waving in the breeze. To me it seemed every leaf was swaying in unison. The tree was flowing in an entrancing, swirling dance. At this I giggled. For here, just 30 minutes ago I'd been on the verge of panic, almost out of my mind with fear, and now the whole world within and without seemed to be collapsing from tension into a calm pool of flowing, euphoric well-being. What a rushing thrill! Just like the fear of jumping off a cliff into deep water. It seems safe, you see others do it, but you've also heard it's possible to get hurt or killed, however you've swam below and swam down to the bottom and seen that it's deep enough, and you've seen others do it, so you stand there, and finally you say 'I'm gonna do it!!!' And your run towards the edge and leap out, and soon you're hitting major G forces as you accelerate towards the water so far below. 'Yeeeeeeoooooooooowwwwwwhoooooh!' you shriek and then you plunge into the deep, refreshing water, safe and un- harmed. Half the thrill, for me, was the intense fear followed by the safe 'landing' in the meadow. This is part of what creates the feeling of having gone on a long journey afterwards - the range of feelings from near terror to pure euphoria make for quite an intense experience that afterwards will seem like a very long journey.", "I had noticed the beauty of the meadow before, but now I seemed to be able to drink in the glowing, fresh, life-affirming, intoxicating warm beauty of my natural surroundings, radiant in the late morning mountain sunshine.", "I picked up my harmonica again and starting singing through it sweet little folk songs from my childhood I'd learned to play on it. It was difficult to play, because I kept giggling. ", "I next took my harmonica and waded out into the high green grass swaying in the breezy warm sunshine in the meadow. As I walked towards the center of the meadow, buzzzy little bumbly beeeeezzze buzzed drunkenly by my buzzing, bubbly, giggly head. I lay down on my back playing my harmonica in unison with the beeze, the birds, the swaying grass and tree tops. The sun flashed streaks of rainbows in the deep blue sky. I sang with glee through my harmonica, stopping only from time to time for a happy, wailing laugh. Everything seemed to be melting slightly in the warm caressing sunshine, including me.", "It seemed like I melted away into the meadow and became part of the swirling swaying breezy beezy sunny meadow, and it seemed I laid there and played my harmonica all day. It was literally almost as though I'd died and gone to heaven.", "Finally I got up and carved 'Johnny Appleseed loves Pippy Longstocking' in a heart on the old picnic table with my pocket knife, and wrote more in letter to my friend about how good I felt.", "The only other thing I remember that night was that as I fell a sleep, hours after I'd come down from the trip, I was jumpy, a bit scared in my tent of the sounds coming from the dark woods around the meadow. Several times I started awake thinking I'd stopped breathing as I'd teetered on the edge of sleep. Finally I drifted off, but was awakened by racoons trying to break into my food. They really spooked me, even though they were just racoons. I think the fear was residual not of the drug, but of the near panic before the drug came on.", "the following words are as true as any I am capable of writing. The reader will take caution to remember that these are still metaphors, a pale gloss on what really occurred. ", "With that in mind, here is the greatest true story I can muster:", "After reading The Archaic Revival, I was immediately impressed by Terence McKenna and his incredible ideas, which to me rang so true. I rapidly sought out his other works, and The Invisible Landscape struck me as the most important. For those who have not read it, it is a description of an incredible 'transcendental errand' performed by Terrence and his brother Dennis. The book also attempts to explain, in readable language, the mechanics behind their transdimensional doings. The basic premise of the experiment was that the brain is really a sort of tuning device capable of focusing on any information anywhere in the holographic universe. Certain molecular vibrations (namely psilocybin when combined with mao-inhibitors) allow the brain to discover information which is normally masked. Read this book, my description is woefully inadequate. Anyhow, I was interested enough to naively dabble in these realms myself.", "The McKenna experiment involved high doses of fresh, Amazonian specimens of Stropharia cubensis and an ayahuasca preparation. I decided not to deal with any MAO-inhibitors, but I did have a supply of nice Psilocybe cyanescens, which is by weight more potent than the common cubensis. I ate six grams of dried cyanescens. The setting was a dark house on the Chesapeake Bay, in the middle of a February snowstorm. The fire cackled as I awaited results. Within minutes of ingesting the mushrooms, I felt the first intimations of what was to come, huge waves of psychedelic energy manifesting themselves as 'wind' flowing through my body. I vomited violently, and retreated to the nearly pitch-black bedroom to lie down. My companion in the experiment claimed 'I'm scared!' and my own teeth started to vibrate horribly, in conjunction with the 'wind' described above. A horrendous, joyous, and absolutely unbelievable set of events followed.", "The following events (to paraphrase FB Lamb in Wizard of the Upper Amazon) are metaphor, it has taken me about 2 years to produce this reconstruction of what occurred on that fateful eve.", "I thought I was dead. I knew I had done it to myself, but could not for the life of me remember what I had taken, why I was dead, or how it happened. I simply knew that I had done it, and I was somehow in a galactic prison, or a purgatory perhaps. The visions were plentiful, yet solemn. At this point they were mostly in black and white. I could feel my ego being physically crushed, just like a can still full of liquid. As the pressure increased, the contents pushed 'outward'. Eventually this culminated in some sort of squashed feeling which I can only relate to the poor 2-D creatures of the sci-fi classic FLATLAND. I spent some time in this suffering, progressively more terrifying state.", "Eventually an entity came and delivered me unbidden personal attention. I was quite relieved to see another creature, for I suspected I was one myself (although not sure). At first I was captivated by its fluid motions and methodical actions. It was moving in rythyms, doing a dance of sorts. Eventually it occurred to me that the 'dance' it was doing involved horrifying probes of my own form, and that it was moving faster than I could comprehend while doing so. I was paralyzed. I wasn't sure if I had a body or not, but this thing was doing something to ME, which was still intact. As I concentrated more and more upon its 'physical' form (which is a term I use as loosely as possible), it occurred to me that it looked somewhat familiar. Not anything I had ever seen, but close. It was a giant preying mantis, although it had mental appendages and cartoon details about it. It also looked more squat than the terrestrial version of the insect, shorter and more robust. Its many arms worked up and down my existence, probing and testing every bit. It seemed to put no effort into comforting me, yet it did through some sort of telepathy imply that it would be easier for both of us if I stopped struggling. Eventually I did, and it left.", "I lost almost all physical awareness, and felt my mind drifting through something resembling outer space. I saw stars, celestial bodies, etc, but was not sure if they were as such, or molecules. The difference seemed irrelevent at that point. I knew I had a brain, and a pair of lungs. I thought that was all. Imagining myself, I saw the brain connected to the lungs behind it, and realized that these two organs in this array must have influenced the design of that dreaded spaceship ''The ENTERPRISE'. As I charted the cosmos, I became aware that through a bit of imagining, or some similar process, I could arrange them to my own satisfaction. I found that different arrangements produced different mental states, some I had known while others were wildly strange. Upon reflection, the impression that I had was that I was re-arranging molecules which were fundamental in neuro-transmitting tasks. One arrangement of the 'stars' felt similar to LSD, one to 2CB, and so forth. I was not aware of this at the time, however. I simply moved the stars according to whim, and felt pleased with the immediate physical results. ", "I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but I eventually slipped into another 'room'. This was the typical round room deep psychedelics take me to. However, this time it was much larger than normal. Around the perimeter flowed the forms of creatures who looked more like cartoon drawings of dogs than anything else. They seemed Mayan, in as far as they all had dragging tongues and eyes which looked only backwards. They seemed to give me a grinning, sarcastic sneer as they drifted past me. Meanwhile, in the middle of the 'sphere', I had other entities to deal with. I cannot come up with any words to describe most of them, although the frivolous doodles which cover the margins of my school lecture notes come closer than anything at approximating their forms. The only clear example I can present is one interesting specimen: I saw a Mexican man, dressed in traditional Huichole garb, kneeling and vomiting on himself. He looked up at me with a knowing glance, and continued his vomiting. I wondered later if I really met him or not. I also wondered what entheogen or technique took us to the same place. It occurred to me a month or so later to wonder if he had seen a college honkey, stoned to the gills on mushrooms, floating through his own sacred space. ", "I finally relaxed, enjoying the inevitability of it all. instantly, flowers looking like opium poppies surrounded me and the 'machine-elves' of DMT fame came to visit. They assured me that I was safe, and really a nice guy to boot. In their high pitched collective voice, they sang a song revealing to me not only my own nature, but that of all creatures as well. They assured me that my DNA was not only similar to their own, but part of as well as *encompassing* their own 'code'. They stressed the simultaneousness of this seemingly contradictory statement. I started to laugh out loud, mostly at the absurdity of it all. My laughing became uncontrollable. It should be added that at this point I was so immersed that it did not matter if my eyes were open or closed. However, this laughing was the first event in what seemed like months which reminded me of my personal form and body. And I laughed... I could not stop!", "The laughing at one point 'locked on' to a particular vocal frequency, and I could not get it to budge. Indeed, I was aware that I was releasing a monotonal hum. Even breathing did not seem to interfere with its clarity. I found it satisfying, and started to explore. By going with the sound, instead of trying to stop it, it grew louder and louder. Eventually it culminated in what McKenna correctly describes as a metallic buzzing sound. Very much like the sound of a cicada, but with many other elements added. I did feel as a bug making the sound, and I had an intuitive understanding of metamorphosis. As this sound continued, I noticed it was affecting my visions. Before, the elves were rapidly and almost violently competing for my attention, each trying to show me a better toy than the last. But this incredible sound caused them to order themselves into intricate yet subtle patterns of the greatest coherency. By slightly altering the pitch of the growl, or modulating it, the patterns changed. After some time, I could actually sculpt three dimensional objects. I did not attempt to make a chair, or a dog, or anything like that, but rather sculptures of pure light and revolving spheres, towers of emerald surrounded by throbbing orbs of sound and love. These were the toys I presented back to the machine-elves. This ability continued for what I would (with no way of ever knowing) say was roughly a half hour. This was the most satisfying, absurd, and enjoyable feeling I have ever had in my life. All frustrations associated with inability to express myself were flattened. It was as if I were vomiting my soul right into the air, where it loved to dance and play. ", "So now I am left with a ridiculous set of goals in life. I have done this again with another person who claimed the ability, and indeed the visions are seen by both parties. Like mental sex of untold richness. The possibilities of this 'language' with no danger of misinterpretation are so staggering I can't conceive of pursuing any other future for us monkies. To my amazement, and despite my wide sampling of the psychedelic community across the U.S., this phenomenon is almost unknown. I don't know what triggers it, only that if I eat enough mushrooms it will come. Strangely, I have not been able to have much success with the vocalizations on DMT, where this supposedly manifests itself more readily. ", "My cousin and I decided to trip for the first time the night before a Phish concert. We assumed we would find more drugs, when we'd get there. He and I WERE good friends prior to the trip...", "He and I had picked up an eigth of shrooms. We had been told by the person who sold us the shrooms, that you shouldn't take a person who flips out to the hospital unless they are comatose or violent, because the hospital can't speed the drugs out of your system. You must wait it out.", "We began the evening with a good start. We didn't drive and we didn't get into any hostile situations, until he 'came down early'. I was fucking nuts and had been all evening. It hadn't been a problem, but I was acting very oddly. I didn't know who my parents were. I was making no sense. I lost touch with the greater part of reality. No real visual halucinations ('cept tracers), just raw confusion. However, my cousin was the one to panic. He was afraid I was O.D.ing or I was permanently nuts, and he drove me to the hospital.", "I was chewing on a Road Atlas in the back of his car, when one of the hospital staff adressed me with the question: 'What did you take?' I replied in terms that made perfect 'sense' to me, '17 hits of acid in 17 days,' and I repeated myself until I had felt I had made myself completey clear. Things pretty much went downhill from there, and as you can probbaly guess, I missed the Phish concert.", "My cousin kindly informed the hospital that I was overdosing on shrooms. They led me to the Emergency Room where they tried make me lie down on a table; they were planning to pump my stomach, unbeknownst to me. I resisted. They insisted. A struggle involving swearing, biting, much thrashing 'bout, and a good half dozen people including doctors, security guards, and nurses who forced me down on the table. ", "They injected me with something, which I am guessing is Thorazine, which stopped almost all of my muscle movements. I couldn't blink, or breath. I was on a lung machine to keep me breathing. All I could do for nine hours was piss and weep. I WAS CONSCIOUS THE ENTIRE TIME! [Stilling tripping balls, too.] I experienced getting my stomach pumped, which may I add, is quite painful and disorienting. I could not force myself into sleep, and any attempt escape the reality before me failed. Only darkness and pain existed.", "It took me a few hours to realize that I was actually in a hospital, because I could only hear what was going on around me and see when my mother or a nurse wiped the tears from my eyes. I freaked out periodically, because I strained to move my limbs (or anything at all), which were totally unresponsive. At one point I came to the frightening conclusion, that I had broken my spine in some horrible accident and would have to suffer the rest of my life trapped within a black hell. ", "Eventually (the end of the 9 hour ordeal) I could twitch my arms, which they strapped down, and I fell asleep and woke up in a hospital room. The first questions I asked were, 'Did anything come up from the pump?' 'No.' 'Do I have brain damage?' 'No.' 'Did the mushrooms I took paralyze me?' 'No.' It was off hospital record. I spent 3 days there for an irregular heart beat they noticed while they were monitoring me. The bill totalled $6000, fortunately somehow covered by my 'rents insurence. I was grounded for two weeks! : ] But, forever, there is a gap between my parents and I. My cousin never said he was sorry.", "I tripped again, under more supervised circumstances (with experienced trippers and steady rolling friends) to prove to myself that I would have been fine without the hospital's help. I went nuts again, but all went well, I merely learned I have a great susceptability to shrooms, and I have experimented with many other hallucinogens (LSD, anti-histamines (Benadryll/Dramamine), DXM, Estacy, and Morning Glory seeeds.) since then, and had a damn fine time, too. I still trip off shrooms; I have learned to survive the confusion that ensues, plus it is cheaper because I require less. I also learned very strong coping skills. Oh, well. What doesn't kill you only makes you stranger...", "I want to lend a word of encouragement to those of you who wish to try the wondrous experience of cultivating mushrooms. Using a combination of various methods (based around pressure cooking some brown rice cakes), I have been successful! I began with 2 spore prints about 1 1/2 months ago. One print I aquired by mail, the other I had made myself while overseas (with a piece of paper and a p. mexicana cap). I suggest that anyone who wants to try this should get a spore print from a reputable source. The one I made myself has worked, but many more jars became contaminated. ", "Persistence has been key in getting my jars to the point of sprouting 'shrooms. If you asked me last week, though, I would say it was a failure. The rice cakes, fully colonized, had been in my humidifier-tank for almost two weeks, and we were just gonna eat the cakes. When I pulled one out, I noticed some little mushroom nubs near the bottom. Rejoicing followed.", "All the info you may need is easily attainable online, but I would like to make a couple of important observations/techniques available as well:", "First of all, my successful jars were all clones of the strongest mycelium from the spore print growth. This required an extra two weeks, but was well worth it. Once my first round of jars became colonized, I simply cut off small bits of mycelium from the two strongest-looking jars and innoculated fresh rice cake jars with that. These jars were colonized completely within two weeks and turned out to be very resistant to my sometimes-careless handling which likely introduced contaminants.  These are the jars (with the exception of one earlier run and one 'mexicana' I saved) that are fruiting right now. ", "This leads me to my next observation: Getting the cakes colonized was relatively easy, but fruiting? They took their sweet time. Hey, I'm in no rush, but it was disconcerting; wondering if the cakes would succumb to infection before bearing the sought-after fruit.", "The jar to fruit first was one that I didn't 'pop' out of its jelly jar and set in the tank. It was one that I left IN the colonization jar, due to one small exposed patch of rice. Well, condensation ran down the inside of the jar, and this wet spot was where the little 'shroomies first appeared--not on top, as I expected.", "When I noticed these little guys poking their heads up (as we were about to eat the cake, since we thought it wasn't gonna grow!), I popped the cake out onto some vermiculite and into the tank. Lo and behold, all the cakes (which are NOT all the same age!) began fruiting within a day.  Perhaps sort of like the action of ethylene, emitted by the pears and peaches in your kitchen as they ripen, stimulating the ripening of their nearby fruits, the mushrooms may stimulate their neighbors. This seems likely to me due to the simultaneous fruiting of jars of various ages. One jar is only 50% colonized, on the top half, it's still in the jar (uncovered of course), and it is fruiting right next to the others.", "I'll have to take a 'shroom-coated cake with me on a little picnic to sit next to the big ol' cow pie I innoculated out in the yard. Grow little guys!!! Grow!!  Draw what educated conclusions you can from these uncontrolled, amateur lab observations. Maybe this will help some of you in your own 'growing' projects. Best of luck!", "I'd just given blood earlier in the day.  I'd studied up on mushrooms (I thought it had been enough) via word of mouth.  I don't discredit what people say but I do think some people have no idea what they're talking about.  As this was going to be my first psychedlic experience ever, I knew very little.  I knew that I would be fucked up and seeing some stuff and overall happy.  Wow, how ignorant I was.", "I began the evening alone, eating 1/16 an ounce all at once (chewing and eventually swallowing).  I then met up with some friends on the other side of the college campus as we had decided to go search for a party.  BTW, this was at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, CA.  ", "Anyway, as nothing was 'happening' with the shrooms after 1/2 hour, I felt they weren't working...like I hadn't eaten enough.  So, I drug my friends (who had no experience with shrooms at all or anything else psychedelic for that matter) back to my dormroom and I ate the rest of the 1/8 oz. ", "I didn't feel anything still until we arrived at two huge parties, one at a house on one side of the street and one at a house on the opposite side, with people spilling into the streets.  It was disorienting.  It all hit me at once.", "I began seeing things as my two friends and I walked up to the house on the right.  I stopped, turned around and and watched in disbelief as I saw approximately eighteen people who I'd seen and/or knew in my residence hall walk past me on the street in a single-file line and just as quickly disappear.  I hopelessly waved my hand at every other person, attempting to say hi!  One of my friends tapped me on the shoulder and asked what the fuck I was doing.  I knew it was time for me to go.  ", "So one of my friends walked me home and I was explaining these emmense powers I was feeling and seeing all around me.  He had no clue what was happening but was somewhat facinated by my descriptions.  We walked by the school pool and gym and I could feel the energy from some generator inside the building sending waves through me.  We then came to a dirt area which was roped off but we began to walk onto it.  I could see tiny little red dots just inside this section.  They were all glowing.  My friend, of course could not see this.  We then came upon a sign at the edge of the roped off area that read 'Grass Seeding In Progress - Keep Off'.  This amazed me.  I could actually see the invisible seeds.", "Ok, so we depart (my friend and I) once we get to the residence hall.  I go to my room to try and chill out.  Doesn't work.  So I sit on my bed.  and I sit on my bed.  and sit and sit.  I feel myself changing.  I feel as though I'm turning into a female, with a females thoughts and wording and everything.  This freaks me out.  I decide to go to bed.", "The lights go out and I quickly slide onto my bed, shuffling off slowly into the underworld.  Flames flicker outside my window and I jump out of bed.  Howls and screams come from the fire atop the campus buildings.  they cry for me to join them.  I lay back down on my bed, almost feeling the heat from the flames.  I start to shake.  Oh my God!  I though I OD'ed.  I thought I died and was going to hell.  ", "I contemplated calling my parents to tell them I died.  I did this for about 5 minutes then decided I couldn't work the phone.  I then decided it would be quicker to ask my neighbors in the rooms next to me if I was dead.  I turned on the light and sat on my bed for around 15 minutes, hearing others in the residence hall whispering about me through the walls.  They were all saying terrible things about me and how funny it was I thought I'd turned into a girl.  ", "I finally remembered that Dave, my friend had told me after hearing I was going to shroom that if anything happened or if I just wanted to I could just stop by and see him.  Boy, that sounded like a good idea...company.", "So it took me around 20 minutes to walk down the hall to his room (his room was approximately a ten to fifteen second walk away normally).  The mirror in the center of the hallway took up 15 of those minutes.", "So thank God Dave was there.  He was listening to some country music, which I usually HATE but when I heard it, it was really great.  Something other than my thoughts to think about.  I asked him for approximately five minutes over and over again if I had died.  As he tried to convince me I hadn't, his face began to change into a mouse and then the devil.  When I told him this he looked pissed then he gave me a look of understanding.  ", "'You're so lucky this is your first trip.  I wish I could go back.  Tell you what, I'll be your guide for the evening'.  ", "So he was.  I felt like he was some kind of God leading me through the waves of light, sound, and reason.  He took me for a journey I will never forget.  He took me away from hell and into a heaven on earth.  We went outside and and I marveled at breathing trees and flowers emitting rays of red, blue, and gold in the middle of the night.  ", "Needless to say it was a long night.  There is a point to me explaining this trip other than the fact that whenever I explain it over again by word of mouth or otherwise, I almost feel like I'm partially tripping again.  ", "I learned a number of lessons.  From now on I will do my research first, plan my activities, and make sure I hang out with somebody experienced.  I also won't take too much again.", "So one night me and 2 friends head up to our good friend's college for a night of beer and bong rips. Well to our surprise when we got there we had an opportunity to get shrooms. We all jumped on the chance since they are impossible to find around here. So needless to say me and my 2 buddies all got an eighth and we devoured them right away.", "So we were sitting around watching t.v. And smoking lots of pot for about an hour and realized that nothing was happening to any of us. So we stayed for another hour or so and decided to go home. On our way to the car i remember eating a pretzel and then being in a hazy dreaming state. Like the one when you first start to fall asleep. I could see colors and hear voices. I opened my eyes and realized i was on the ground looking up at about 15 faces. I stood up and i couldn't see or walk straight, man, i was instantly tripping my face off! Everyone kept asking me if i needed to go to the hospital. I said 'no no i'm cool' even though i knew i wasn't. Everything was one big swirl (looked like spin art, if you remember what that was). Anyway my head was gushing blood from falling backwards on the pavement. ", "So off to the hospital we went, of course getting lost on the way. I was tripping so hard but i couldn't stay conscious. Into the ER I went, (my first time to the hospital) i had to tell the nurses i was on shrooms and pot. So i sat there bleeding and shrooming while listening to some guy scream bloody murder for 30 minutes before the doctor came to stitch my head back up. Good thing they let my friends in the room to keep me from flipping. The doctor was making jokes about it too. But the shitty part was going home at 3am to tell my mom i was tripping and i had a concussion. Every time she came to wake me up i was shrooming, even the next morning when i woke up. But as for my friends they didn't feel a damn thing off those shrooms. ", "I don't know what the hell happened that night, i guess even the most experienced have trouble sometimes. But i've learned that drugs fuck you up in the long run. Unfortunately i found out through all bad experiences. Have your fun and enjoy life but think about what you're putting into your bodies. In my opinion, all that shit they spoon-fed you as a kid is true - drugs are bad! Just smoke some pot and you won't have to worry about going to the hospital because you hurt yourself or because you're od-ing.", "I'd once before tried mushrooms when I was younger, and to be honest my experience was rather tamed. In hindsight, my approach to the substance was all wrong. I'd never before used any kind of drugs except for cannabis, and therefore my expectations were formed around stereotypes. Contrary to my belief, friends of mine used to speak of their amazing experiences using mushrooms. I arrogantly rejected these wild tales, until my use of other drugs had 'prepared' my attitude sufficiently. It was with this mentality that I took a whole new approach to mushrooms, which ultimately resulted in ONE UNFORGETABLE DAY.", "Two good friends and I carefully planned the route we would walk the following day across the moors in search of mushrooms. The chosen route would take us through several notorious hot spots for finding mushrooms, and some other moorland areas. The walk itself I have to say was awful. Torential rain and low mist made the fifeteen mile treck full-on bollox. I have to say though, it felt very rewarding when ever we discovered terratory with vast amounts of the li'l devils. Finding a patch would inspire us to keep looking for more, and thus keep walking.", "Back at my friends house, we proceeded to prepare the mushrooms by making a large mushroom-tea brew. At this stage I was very tired after such a long day walking, but in my mind I was excited and very eager to try the brew. After consuming our mugs of tea, one friend of mine who had tried them before (and had a very emotional experience) looked somewhat agitated (biting nails on his fingers etc.). When asked what was wrong, he replied, 'Now we are all beyond the point of return.' This did not worry me, but it was not until later that I understood what he had meant.", "We drove to another friend's house, and on arrival we began to feel the mushrooms taking affect. I noticed how physically I was no longer tired, and at first the overwhelming rushes felt similar to those of a good pill. I was delirious as it seemed all the hard work had paid off, but I hadn't even fully come up yet. The colour of the grass and the sky captivated me and made me so happy to be alive and living. My vision became somewhat distorted, and my mind was filled with wierd humour (most noticable was my vision of kicking someone on all fours up the ass and into the distance). For me, time stood still and I simply could not comprehend the shear strength and power of the mushrooms. ", "As I walked home that evening I had time to remenise on the days events. I felt shocked that something which grew locally could have such marvellous effects. In contrast to my first experience, I now had a great degree of respect for the drug, and felt privileged to have had the opportunity to try it. I had learnt that it is a powerful drug and that if you did not respect it, then it could easily bite back. I felt relieved that I had not consumed more than I had for fear that this could have completely screwed me up.", "I pledge first time users to be very wary of how many they consume, and to have the right attitude towards drugs before you attempt mushrooms. With these premeses permitting you to have ONE UNFORGETABLE DAY.", "This is not a report from a single experience on mushrooms, rather a warning and useful advice that i hope you will take into consideration before your next trip. I would consider myself an avid user of psilocybe mushrooms and believe that they can be very useful for spiritual self introspection in the right hands. I also believe that mushrooms are a much stronger drug than many people give them credit for. Since the first time I used mushrooms I have witnessed three seizures resulting from their ingestion. The first was a good friend of mine who had been indulging in a pretty large amount of cubensis picked the night before from a nearby field. It was Thanksgiving day and we were inside a fast food place ordering some food when my friend walked out of the bathroom and stated that he didn't feel so good and then proceeded to fall onto the floor and go into slight convulsions. Another friend and I tried to pick him and drag him out to the car as everybody in the restaurant was flipping out but he had truly turned into jello. He was slipping through our hands like water. ", "Once we got to the car he started to come back to reality and had no recollection of what had happened. as I drove off it occured to me that he was driving prior to me and I thanked god that this didn't happen while he was behind the wheel. ", "The next incident happened to another good friend of mine just out of my reach. He went into the bathroom as we all sat in the living room where we heard what sounded like him banging on the shower door. when we went into the bathroom he was on the floor just regaining consiousness, blood pouring out of his head where he had cut his ear open on the trashcan and then hit his head on the ground. He described what he called violent convulsions but wasn't quite sure what had happened. The last incident happened just two days ago to my sister which is what has compelled me to write this. There were six of us and we bought an ounce of hydroponic mushrooms to split between us all. We ate the mushrooms at my house and then went to enjoy the sights of downtown Portland where i am currently residing. We walked around for hours starting at about midnight enjoying the sights basically trippin' balls. ", "As we were walking back to the truck my sister sat down on the ground. I asked if she was ok and she said that she simply wanted to sit down. I told her we should sit on a bench where we wouldn't look so odd in the middle of downtown at four in the morning. we got up and started walking to a bench when she stated that she felt really fucked up and then started falling to the ground. I managed to catch her before she hit the ground and started calling her name trying to bring her back to conciousness. She lay there with a cold blank stare in her wide open eyes for what seemed like forever but was probably about fifteen seconds but i'm not really sure. After she regained conciousness she still seemed a little out of it but was functioning normally. she was mainly wondering why everyone was around her and I was asking stupid questions like 'do you know where you are' or 'how many fingers am I holding up.' I told her to stay there and walked the remaining ten or so blocks to the car an brought it back to pick her up. ", "By then she had figured out what had happened and apologized to me for having to go through that. I have always played the role of the designated driver on mushrooms but I now firmly believe that NOBODY should drive on mushrooms. These three incidences all happened to what I would consider experienced and responsible drug users. This is a very spontaneous thing and it can happen to you, me, or anybody using mushrooms. DO NOT DRIVE WHILE ON MUSHROOMS AND DO NOT GET IN A CAR WITH ANYONE WHO HAS USED MUSHROOMS! I am lucky. I could very easily be dead. furthermore I would suggest having a sober babysitter or at least someone who is very experienced with what you are doing. I am surprised to find no reports of this kind anywhere and I will do everything within my power to get the word out. Happy shroomin'", "Just last night I went to a Dave Matthews concert. I have never tripped on LSD, just mushrooms, several times. Once again I'd eat the shrooms before my concert. I took a little less than usual but they were getting old and I think might have made a little more potent. I didn't realize the trip I was in for. The night before, my sister whom I was going to the concert with told me not to embarrass her because I was going with her friends who are a few years older. By the way, I just graduated high school. Anyways, none of the people I went with did any drugs at all. They were actually against it. So I knew I'd have to be somewhat 'normal'. When we got to the lot before the concert. I ate my shrooms, drank a few beers and smoked some bowls. About 45 minutes in the lot the visuals kicked in first. There were lines in the sky everywhere, travelling every which way. The whole atmosphere was just swaying and whoa, just looked real cool. I said at the time 'I hope I just stay like this all night I'll be great.'", "I was able to speak and doing fine just having fun. A bunch of things happened as we went in and I started to think (a lot). Everything that was happening, I felt was the opposite was going on. Someone came up to my sister and was asking questions, and I was so paranoid the whole time. I actually thought he was a cop busting her for something, not until later she told me that he was really doing a survey for something. Unless you've tripped before I can't explain the weird thoughts that run through your head and how you feel. But it's probably ten times stronger than you can even imagine. You are completely not in this world. Physically, yeah, but on such different level reality of thought then the rest. It's very hard to communicate.", "We finally sat down and I sat on the grass and began to enjoy my trip. I don't think I looked like I was having fun, I kept thinking they thought I was insane. I would laugh hysterically to myself at the funny things I saw. I was just in my own world jamming to the beats. I had a conversation with my sandals who I thought were a man and woman couple. They turned into angels inviting me into their home. Which made me feel good. I became so focused on things. I'd look up at the sky for what seemed like a minute, but I think it was more like a half hour. The sky was more beautiful then I'd even seen. That day happened to be beautiful, pink and purple clouds just enhanced my trip. It actually looked like there were different portals opening up capturing me, taking me to different times and galaxies. It was awesome. Time was nothing. If I thought it was only 5 minutes gone by, it was really an hour. Or the opposite. Very confusing. I just wished I had someone to share it with.", "I tried to talk, but the trip just got stronger and I could hardly speak a word. Actually I remember now I ate another stem in the middle of it, why I don't know. I knew no one knew what I felt which was an annoying feeling. I started to get very uncomfortable. Thoughts raced through my mind more than I could ever believe. I thought I knew everything. Those people didn't know anything they were all the same. Only I knew, but if I told anyone they'd think I'm nuts and not believe me. It was sort of scary. I felt extreme guilt and just about every other emotion there is at one time. Like I was a bad person. I just felt I would never come back to reality again. I didn't care about anything. I really just wanted the thoughts in my head to go away so I can enjoy the music. The number or questions that arose on me was incomprehensible. What was this? What is life? WHY ANYTHING? Was the biggest thing.", "As much fun as I was having I had just as bad a time. So paranoid and ashamed of myself. Anyhow I was tripping the whole time. The end of the concert I realized I couldn't name one song Dave played, I was so distracted with everything. I could hear every single person's conversation and I just wanted them to shut the hell up. But the music was still amazing and just filled the air the whole time.", "We went back into the car and began out ride home. This would be hard cause I didn't even know if my sisters two friends knew I was tripping. She just told them I was fucked up. So I was embarrassed at myself and tried to be okay. They looked at me funny though and it was a horrible feeling. I started coming down as we got home and I came home and talked to my mom and was fine. My sis told me never to trip in front of her again cause she doesn't like it or seeing me on it. I felt real bad about that. Today I woke up and I've had the hardest day ever. No work, just mad thoughts racing through my head.", "Why did I do this what have I done? Before I felt like I'd have to go to a mental hospital, my brain was going to explode. Questioning everything I've ever believed. I'm feeling much better now and I will still say I love mushrooms and will definitely do them again. To enter the level I get on when I'm tripping is just an amazing experience and I've learned so much. This past trip taught me how to deal with these emotions and just help it make me a better person. Only now, I'll only trip with people I know well and who are also tripping with me. That's the most fun and best way. Other than that, respect these drugs, they aren't for everyone, but if used in the right setting they are a life changing experience.", "About 2 weeks ago I decided to venture into the world of magical mushrooms.  I only started experimenting with drugs this year, and mushrooms would be my first hallucinogenic drug experience.  A friend and I ate them with apple juice as a chaser at about 8:45 AM. They tasted pretty gross but it was manageable. We were staying at a resort, so we decided to go and sit in this lounge area and wait for them to kick in.  About 20 minutes later we became giggly and were acting kinda weird. I'm not sure if it was in anticipation or what. My friend, who weighs only 100 pounds, starting feeling it about then and said my face was melting off.  I was surprised because I was expecting it to take a lot longer to kick in.  We went into this bathroom and I started feeling a body high and the walls were closing in on us. We ran out, sat outside and smoked a cigarette.  Plants were starting to look very weird and we got this weird urge to run and find a hidden meadow. So we did.", "Thank god we were in nature and we knew that there would be a meadow across the street. We made our way over there, but got distracted when we decided to lay down in the grass road divider.  We called some car over to us and asked them how to get 'downtown,' but I had a very hard time talking to them and understanding.  This was about 45 minutes to an hour after we ate the mushrooms.  We went through the barbed wire fence and walked around in some brushy forest-like area.  Everything was so weird, and we felt fearless. We met a couple of trees, one named Henry who had a very distinct personality to us and we took a picture with him.", "We noticed a clearing and upon arriving at it we realized it was the perfect meadow. Small grasses, wild flowers, beautiful bugs, everything we could ask for.  By this time we were feeling it so powerfully that we could barely stand. We sat down and talked to the bugs. I spent about 2 hours looking at the clouds, which were making pictures, swirling and rolling like an ocean. Colors were bright, and everything was extremely over-stimulating.  Ugly things were beautiful to me and the (real) bugs crawling all over my arm were not a threat, but my friends.  I remember talking to a bee, saying, 'Look at you over there bee.  Just doing your job so wonderfully and polinating like you should.  How great!'  Or something bizarre like that.  The small hairs on my friend's face were crawling all over and they made me laugh.", "I brought crayons and my journal to write in and I was glad I did. I had some intense thoughts about humanity and our existence. I felt a strong feeling of hate towards other humans besides my friends, for how they've fucked the world up.  I felt like shrooms were a tool for humans to use so we could see our wrongdoing and appreciate wildlife like we should.  I remember thinking many other things that I don't remember, but that I wanted to write down but I couldn't because my words were crawling off the page.", "After about 4 hours we decided to see somewhere new. We tried to walk downtown, but after about 10 minutes of being around some people and houses, we couldn't stand it and decided to get our hippy asses back to our meadow. We started sobering up and had a little picnic with apples and oranges (THE best apples and oranges I've ever eaten). We started to realize that there were nasty bugs and spiders crawling all over us and biting us.  We got a little freaked out and walked back to the resort.  Once in her house, the doors, cabinets, and everything seemed to have a life of their own and were breathing.  We felt like smoking some weed, but we didn't have any.  We took showers and walked around the resort a little more. The body high was gone and almost everything was normal; this was about 7 hours later.  At about 12:30 that night we noticed that things were still tripping us out and we couldn't understand it.  ", "Now it is almost 2 weeks later and I am either still slightly tripping or having flashbacks.  I noticed yesterday when I was extremely tired and I was looking at this textured ceiling that it was swirling and moving a lot.  It is hard to concentrate on things without spacing out.  This doesn't happen too often, but it is kind of weird.  I loved my experience with mushrooms and it really changed me in a way. Before, I used to litter and disrespect the environment, but now I think twice about it and have some respect.  Mushrooms are great if you do the right amount, but just like many other drugs, I've heard of some scary trips by people who've taken too much (like my boyfriend).  It's definitely my drug of choice, and even though I also love Ecstasy, last time I did it all I could think about were the wonderful mushrooms :) So eat up, and enjoy!", "Yeah, I'm starting to think that wild shroom trip of late last year was the result of having an empty stomach.  A friend and I dosed in the car before going to a special goth night.  He ate ~3 grams, I eyeballed my dose so it could have been more.  Brown caps, blue and beige stems.", "About 20 minutes in I noticed some effects.  A gut-feeling, some excitement.  I joined my friend in the back -- he was feeling it too, but he wanted a cigarette.  I suggested we take a walk (read: he smoke it outside), but nothing doing.  The thought of tobacco smoke at that point was sickening me, so I walked to the front room.", "Basically, the peak lasted about 30 seconds -- I sat down in a less crowded/hot area of the club, I felt like I was reeling, and then my entire field of vision was overlaid with little lower-case S's -- a shuddering, intense hallucination.  I staggered to the bathroom, thinking I might (or might want to) vomit.", "I knelt down by the toilet, which, in a place like that, would normally make me puke anyway, but then my head cleared.  I stood up, realized that the peak was over, and went back to where I was sitting.  I no longer needed to take a walk outside or anything -- I couldn't talk much, but I could stare at people, which is half the point at this place anyway.  My point is, I usually don't notice a peak on shrooms. ", "Later, the back room cleared out and fans ventilated it.  There was room to dance without contact, which was great considering how startling it was sometimes when someone touched me.  I danced and smiled like an idiot, realizing that everyone else was dancing goofier than me, and that, even if I cared, no one would pick me out as the one on drugs.  I had a nice friendly, not-even-that-disjointed conversation with the woman who sat down next to me.", "Mushrooms make me very excited about dancing if the music is right, without interfering with my sense of balance or rhythm (this from my purely subjective POV).  My sense of comfort increased to the point where I thought I was having the most fun ever -- I couldn't imagine not doing this all the damn time, both the gothing and the shrooms.", "My thoughts were very circular and repetitive -- which can be tedious to bad on LSD, but seemed fine in this context.  I thought about the sexual frustration that comes with only using alcohol at clubs.  I realized that without the futile expectation of nookie, I could have fun and still appreciate the people around me in terms of attractiveness, i.e., looking, not leering.", "The circle of thoughts got more profound -- I started thinking about happiness, and life in general, how the only way to be happy was to feel happy, and that this was completely under my control, how I felt.  I got a sense of satori, a feeling of enlightenment that comes from ending up in the same place you started.  Then I giggled at me thinking that I was being so deep.  Heh.", "I could preface this whole report with, 'Maybe it was just the drugs, but I had a great time!' but it could just as easily have been the case that, 'Maybe it was just the drugs, but that place was terrifying and sucked.'  The facts are, the drugs and the venue went well together.  The lights were turned down (they shut off the normally blinding light guns, that or made them a dim color), there was plenty of room to sit and dance, I was on the list and got in for free, and the staff and patrons I encountered were very friendly.  We stuck around 'til closing (I was also trying to get a cut on my finger to close -- don't fish chunks of glass out of a drain while you're tripping, kids).", "I have been tripping on mushrooms, as well as several other drugs, for a few years now but nothing ever compares to the first time...", "One day while I was just sitting around, bored to tears, my friend Dan calls me up and asks if I'm interested in trying mushrooms. He had just gotten some and was ready for a night of head-tripping. At the time I was 18 and smoked weed regularly as well as drop some E every so often...But I had never hallucinated. Since I had been curious for a long time, I was quite eager to shroom. ", "Around 9 pm at night, Dan shows up at my place with a big grin on his face. I can barely contain myself either! He starts going through my things, putting stuff we were going to use aside.... my bong nestled safely in its bag, a gram of weed, bottles of water, blankets, pillows... He asks if I have a sleeping bag. Why, where are we going? ...to the woods. He explains that mushroom trips are always best outside. I'll take his advice since he has tripped many times before this. So I grab my backpack and we set off for the woods in his car. ", "Once we get there, we park the car and hike about half a mile up this trail. The 'home base' we decide on is absolutely beautiful. The moon is full, or at least very close to being full, and is bathing the entire area in a soft, milky glow. Everything is very lush and green and colorful wildflowers are scattered in bunches everywhere. Nearby we can hear a stream flowing and the sound of crickets are everywhere. ", "I start spreading out the blankets, sleeping bags and pillows while Dan gets the mushrooms ready. 'Here...' he calls and places some dry brown mushrooms into my waiting hands. Inspecting them closely, I notice that the caps are a vibrant orange. 'Just start chewing them up and chase it with some water.' Dan tells me. So I pop them in my mouth and start chewing. They aren't the most pleasant tasting things, but they're tolerable. I drink some water and start to feel nervous. What am I supposed to expect?? Dan was careful to give me the low-down on how to have a pleasant mushroom trip before we got here. 'Be prepared that your mind will be leaving reality for awhile.' He had told me. 'And remember... it's not real.' ", "We had eaten the mushrooms around 10 pm. Fifteen minutes have passed and Dan hands me the bong and a lighter. Without a word, I take the bong and smoke the entire bowl he packed for me. He takes a couple hits off it as well. He then hands me a bottle of water and a pill. 'Viatmin C' He explains. 'It'll make the trip stronger.' We both take the vitamin c. Now it's a waiting game... We lay on our backs and start staring at the sky. Occasionally I'll look to my side at some flowers and stare hard at them, wondering if the mushrooms are starting or if I'm just stoned. In reality, I AM just pretty stoned but won't find out until nearly 10:45 pm.", "10:45 is where it all begins. I start feeling giddy... Feelings of ecstacy and mild confusion are washing over me. Then out of nowhere, I start giggling... uncrontrollably. I'm also very cold so I curl up into a fetal position and shiver while I continue to laugh. Everything is incredibly funny to me... We are laying out in the middle of the woods, I am cold, there is a babbling brook in the distance... This is all striking me as very funny. And then I realize that these things are actually not funny at all... this makes me laugh even harder. Soon, my contagious laughter hits Dan and he rolls up into fits of giggles. Since I'm new at this, I start babbling like crazy...telling Dan what I'm feeling, asking him if this is normal, if I'm doing it right, and other sorts of nonsense that my confused brain is forcing out of my mouth. I feel like a baby, finding everything confusing and amusing. ", "I think it's around 11 now, but after this I can no longer relay the time, for my sense of all time perception has completely vanished. Things that seem like minutes can, in reality, be hours...or vice versa. By now the cold sensations have passed as well as the laughing fits. Everything is taking on a very colorful, surreal quality. The flowers I was looking at a half hour ago, are now changing colors slowly, from pink to green to yellow to blue... the petals seems to spiral around and the whole body is dancing. In fact everything is dancing... the flowers, the trees, the moon, the stars, the blades of grass...everything is swaying in a unique rythmn to the 'music' being played by the crickets, the stream and the wind.", "It's time for me to explore. I have taken on a very brave attitude and announce proudly to Dan that I am off to explore the premises.", "He hands me 3 cigarettes and a lighter for my voyage. First, I discover that walking is wonderful. It's like re-discovering my body. The next thing I discover is how wondeful nature is. The trees have such a bright, positive energy and give off a friendly glow. I smile and wave at them as I walk by. The grass rustles softly beneath my feet, the moon lights the way, everything welcomes me, happy that I am here. And I tell them how I am happy I am here as well, happy that I can share such a wonderful experience with them. As I walk, I start listening to 'nature's music' again...the crickets, the stream, the wind and now the leaves have joined in. Who knew that nature could be so hospitable? I thank everyone for greeting me with this lovely serenade. I now hold a much deeper appreciation for nature and vow that I will always respect it. ", "I finally arrive at my destination: the stream. And I am glad that I was so persistent in finding it because it is gorgeous. I recognize the distinct croak of frogs and hurry to pull off my shoes. First I lay on my stomach and stare into the running water. I dip my hand in and take delight in the cool water flowing over it. I watch fixated on the changing colors of the water and then splash some on my face. Very refreshing. I can see a frog, or what looks like a frog, sitting on the other side of the stream, changing from purple to blue and back again. I start talking to it...nothing important...", "just incoherent nonsense...but he seems to understand. I notice an ant walking along my arm and I greet it with a smile. I feel like a part of nature with the ant walking on me and a frog conversing with me and my hands floating in the water. I get up and wade in the water a bit before leaving.", "I continue on my way down the trail. I remember the cigarettes Dan had given me and search for quite awhile until I finally discovered where I had put them...in my pocket... imagine that. So I light one up and feel the smoke fill the inside of my body from head to toe. Then I exhale, watching my body fill the air with smoke. Smoke is beautiful... the colors of the smoke reminds me of a rainbow, which makes me conclude that this smoke is a piece of a rainbow. A very fine wisp, but nevertheless, a piece of rainbow. I watch the tiny rainbow swirl around itself until the sky swallows it up.", "I come to a fork in the road. It looks very inspirational and reminds me of a poem or something like that, but I can't remember which one. I can see a very faint light down the right trail. The left trail is dark and sinister-looking. I choose the right trail...", "Walking down the lit path makes me feel very spiritual..as if I have been chosen. I have successfully finished this life and must now start a new one, right down this path... Arriving at the end of the trail, I see some tents scattered about. It's a campsite but I don't realize that. What I see are others, like me, waiting inside these temporary shelters, preparing for their new lives. Confusion starts to set in again. Should I have a tent? Where am I supposed to go? Should I tell someone I've arrived? Do I have to sign in? I decide to walk around casually. Maybe someone would see me and let me know what was going on.", "I hear someone say something and I spin around. Another human! Is it Dan? Dan! I had forgotten all about Dan! Where was he? Does he know I'm here? And who is this person? I don't recognize the person at all and it makes me nervous. I can't even tell what gender it is! I'm trying desperately to understand what this person is trying to tell me but can only seem to focus on it's face distorting right before my eyes. Suddenly my eyes focus on what's behind this peron... more people gathered in chairs around a fire...staring at me with blank, lifeless stares. It frightens me and it occurs to me that this fire must be the light I had seen at the beginning of the trail. Things don't see right anymore and to make matters worse, now eeryone's face looks exactly the same! Very generic-looking faces... masks... it's like they're wearing masks. I feel slightly panicky when I realize I probably shouldn't even be here, but decide I must leave in a very calm, casual manner... not go running off like an insane person, screaming about masks. If I show my fear, they might chase me...", "So I say something... I'm not sure what, but I am sure that it makes no sense, and then go walking off calmly. I can hear laughter rippling behind me. ", "My next mission is to find Dan and tell him about everything I saw. It seems to take forever but I finally reach home base. Luckily I had the trail to follow, otherwise I might have gotten lost. Dan is not there when I arrive but I'm not upset. He is off hopefully experiencing the same things I had just experienced. I'm pretty sure that I'm finished peaking and I'm starting to feel more sober. The mushrooms are still working though and colors continue to swirl around me...just in a more subtle way. I pack myself a bowl and smoke and lay down, staring at the sky. I sigh, feeling very mellow. Not too much later, I hear footsteps and Dan lays down next to me. I eagerly tell him about the things I did and he tells me what he did, like walk all the way down to the road and lay in the middle of it. How dangerous! I want to scold him for doing something like that, but the thought of Dan laying in the middle of the road can only make me laugh. He gets up and smokes a bowl and lays back down. We talk some more about things that I will not be able to remember in a few hours. Finally we fall asleep around 4 am.", "We wake up at 8 am...we'd much rather sleep, but the sun's heat forces us out of our sleeping bags. We gather our things so we can go home and get some more sleep, but I soon discover my shoes are missing. How long have I been barefoot??, I wonder. Retracing my steps, I find my shoes and socks in a heap next to the stream. I decide to carry them since they are soaked from the morning moisture. Not too far from the shoes I also found 2 cigarettes and a lighter, also wet. I laugh, realizing they were the ones Dan had given me last night. I guess I had dropped them and didn't even notice. I also can't help but notice how small the stream actually is. It had looked so majestic last night...", "Back at home, I drink plenty of water to re-hydrate and take some St John's Wort like Dan had instructed me. 'Your seratonin will be low for the next day or two' he had said. 'Take St John's Wort to help prevent mood swings.' Then I lay down and sleep for hours, excited for my next mushroom trip.", "Around 8:20 p.m., I put my dried mushrooms on a scale and weighed 1.5 grams. I then put them into a coffee grinder and ground them up into a fine powder and put them into gel caps. I took all of the caps and then waited for them to take affect.", "After about an hour, I was getting this weird stoned feeling in the front of my head. Lights had weird auras around them and I felt a peace within myself.

As the music played, I saw snakes coming from underneath the door. I closed my eyes and I saw a pyramid and I saw a jungle overlooking it. I opened my eyes again and I kept seeing more snakes. I got this feeling as I was listening to the music and the next time I closed my eyes, I saw Aztec style art and I let it engulf me. It was a great feeling as if I could let go of everything else and be in a totally different place. I saw neon pink, green, and orange wheels turning with faces all smiling at me. The faces then turned into evil sadistic faces and they all had their features warped: their kind eyes became enlarged, their noses became twisted, and their smiles became gaping mouths full of sharp teeth. This scared me and all of a sudden, I felt a horrible feeling and so then I immediatly opened my eyes.", "My watch had such a weird green glow to it and so I focused on it for a while.

I feel as if an emotional cloud has been lifted from me, and I see things through different eyes.", "1995 Magic Mushroom (Psilocybe Cubensis) Cultivation Project using the PF Technique.", "The spawn run chamber is basically an aquarium with filled with a saturated salt solution (salt will keep germs, bacteria, and other stinky stuff from growing in the water).  The solution is of water and rock salt and extends up the half pint jars to the bump before the lids.  The solution is heated via a submersible aquarium heater and an airstone to turn the water a bit.  The water temperature has been set to 86F, the optimum spawn run temperature.  Fresh water is periodically added to make up for evaporation to maintain the proper water level. If you do not use an aquarium, I DO recommend that you keep the jars in a humid environment.  Also, I recommend that one uses 1/3 cup of water rather than the 1/4th recommended by PF.  Lastly, I used a heaping 1/4 cup of brown rice rather than a level one as PF recommends. ", "Humidity: I recommend you try to keep the jars in 60%-100% humidity so they don't dry out if it takes a LONG time like a couple of mine did. ", "Temperature: 86F is best, but most temperatures that humans can tolerate so can the mycelium of Psilocybe Cubensis. ", "The fruiting chamber consists of a ten gallon aquarium, an ultrasonic humidifier, PVC tubing, a fluorescent light with two 20W Triton aquarium bulbs (similar to Daylight, but stronger), two inexpensive timers, a thermometer and some cut plastic furniture covering.  Most everything can be purchased at Walmart.  I particularly recommend buying the timers there.  Also, look around at pawn shops for ultrasonic humidifiers if you really want a deluxe chamber like mine; they make watering VERY easy. ", "I found my broken ultrasonic humidifier at a pawn shop for $3.  Of course, the ultrasonic transducer (i.e. the little shinny thing at the bottom of the water chamber) was shot.  I called the company who manufactured the unit and they sent me another transducer.  I took the humidifier apart, soldering in the new transducer, and the thing worked fine.  You see these ultrasonic humidifiers 'don't' break; rather, 90% of the time some moron puts syrup in the chamber (which you can do in conventional humidifiers) and destroys the transducer. ", "The humidifier and light cycle via inexpensive timers.  I found that a 12-hour on/off cycle for the lights worked fine.  Remember to be sure the light in shining on all surfaces you intend to try to pin. The humidifier was on a 1-hour on/off cycle.  This is with the humidifier on the LOWEST or almost lowest setting! I cannot say this is the best way to do it, but it worked very well for me.  Besides, Walmart timers cannot be set for any resolution less than one hour. ", "The humid air goes along 1 inch PVC tube around a couple corners and into the aquarium.  Actually, the PVC tubing punches through a clear plastic furniture covering which is over the aquarium.  The covering is cut a minimum of two inches bigger than the actual aquarium top.  I taped one side of this covering and pulled the other over the aquarium.  The loose side of the plastic covering flap is held over the aquarium by a rubber band which stretches around the aquarium (actually it was a string of rubber bands tied together).  The humid air is released close to the floor of the aquarium, rises up around the cakes, and somehow escapes through the small imperfections in the plastic covering draped over the aquarium.  I did not and do not recommend you make holes specifically for exhaust unless you really have the plastic covering on tightly. ", "The humid air condenses on all the surfaces in the aquarium, so I have tilted the aquarium slightly so I can suck the excess water with a turkey baster.  I have learned that you must do this.  The excess water seems to slow mushroom development EVEN if the cakes do not touch the water.  I suspect that the water tends to absorb gasses as bacteria multiply in it.  Also, if you are using an ultrasonic humidifier, I also recommend that one changes the humidifier's water frequently even if it hasn't run out, or else it will become stagnant too.  The stagnant water mucks up the transducer element and probably isn't too good for the cakes either (ultrasonic humidifiers giggle everything into the air, including the bacteria, minerals, etc.).", "There's a little to be said about the condensation problem on the cakes: occasionally, small beads of water did condense on the cakes.  This is not good, but unless the beads are really excessive (a millimeter in diameter or more), I'd recommend you just leave them alone.  A few tiny water beads isn't going to hurt the cakes any more than you dabbing around the pins with a towel or toilet paper. Just keep an eye on it, and try your best to control it.  One thing that will help is if you make sure that the plastic covering is raised a little in the center of the aquarium (like a tent) so that the condensation on the top flows to the sides of the aquarium rather than dripping on the cakes.  Also, if you are using an ultrasonic humidifier, I recommend injecting the misty air close to the bottom of the aquarium, well under the cakes. ", "Lastly, the rice cakes are elevated off the floor of the aquarium by the half pint jars.  You should place the lids back on the jars an put the cakes on this.  If you place the jars on inverted glass jars, as I did originally, pins will try to form on the bottom of the cake, and that's a hassle.

I would like to recommend that first-time trippers be especially careful about dosage levels.  I took approximately 4 dried grams, and I had a bad first trip.  I lost all sense of reality and thought that there was a huge world-wide conspiracy against me and others who had entered the 'mushroom portal'.  I assumed that the trip would last forever, and in many ways, it seemed to.  I also almost destroyed all of the cakes in an attempt to 'close the portal'.  I thank my trip monitor for stopping me.

He went so far as to call his girlfriend to 'begin a new civilization'.  The third person was lucky: she had a good trip.  The point is, start with far less than 4 dried grams. I would recommend you start with 1-2 grams and then work up from there.  Remember, your product, unlike many dealers' stuff, will be very fresh, and so you must adjust accordingly. ", "After I completed growing the my first cakes, I decided to make a spore syringe.  If you intend to keep using the PF technique, I recommend doing the same.  The following tells my method of making spore syringes and how well it worked for me: ", "1) Take a half pint Ball or Kerr jar and make a hole just large enough to stick the needle in toward the edge of the lid.  You should make this in the same place you would an inoculation hole when using PF Tek, except punch through from the TOP to the bottom of the lid rather than the bottom up.  This makes it so the tape in step 4 will seal properly. ", "2) Place the lid on (do not invert the lid like in the growth jars) and screw the band down. ", "3) Sterilize the jar either through steam, dry heat, or boiling water. Be careful here, the rubber seal on the Ball brand jars can start to melt if you use too high of temperature in dry heat sterilization.  I recommend placing foil around the lid to prevent air from going into the hole directly. ", "4) When the jar cools, remove the foil and place tape over the hole.  ", "5) Cut a mature mushroom cap off with a sterilized knife (do not breath on cap).  quickly unscrew the band, remove the lid, and place the cap gills down on the bottom of Kerr jar.  Replace the lid and band quickly.  The room in which you do this should be clean and draft-free.  It might help to spray Lysol around before opening the jar.  Leave the cap in the jar for two or three days. ", "6) Remove the cap and fill the jar with cool sterilized distilled water to within a half inch or so of the rim.  Scrape the spore print under the water loose with a sterilized spoon.  Again, replace the lid and band quickly.  A full print, according to PF, can be used in 300-500 milliliters of water, yet a half pint jar filled a half inch or so from the top is only around 200 milliliters (half pint = 236.6ml), so obviously, this will be a very strong solution. ", "7) I recommend refrigerating the solution when not in use.  I've heard of people keeping spores for over a year this way without germination problems.", "8) When you are ready for use, remove the jar from the refrigerator and shake vigorously for a few minutes.  Immediately after you are done shaking, remove the tape, take a sterilized syringe, and fill the syringe. If the solution in too low to draw off with the jar upright, tilt the jar toward the hole and draw.  Retape the hole immediately with a fresh piece of tape.  In the next month or so, when you are ready to fill another syringe for inoculations, repeat. ", "When I made my first spore syringe, I used a spore print about an inch across and added 50 ml of water.  I filled one 14ml syringe (that's all I had) and inoculated a set of ten jars.  The result was INCREDIBLE! The jars showed hard-to-see signs of germination on the third day.  Within 24 hours of this, however, the jars EXPLODED with growth in each of the quadrants.  These were big spots the size of a quarter or more in 24 hours! Many of the jars colonized fully within seven days after germination.  I lost only one jar to contamination, and this was because I was storing the jars next to something that I later discovered was molding.  I did not use an aquarium to keep the jars at exactly 86F like the first time, yet the germination and mycelium growth was MUCH faster than the when inoculating with spore syringes PF sent me.  I assume this is because my solution was so much more concentrated and fresh than the one they sold me.", "[Post-trip comments are in brackets, like this sentence] ", "6:01pm Began ingesting 1.53 grams dried mixed with 1 can of tuna.

He pulled out at least an oz and said he would give it to me for $60. I told him that i didn't want any (cosidering the fact that his eyes didn't show any color and he kept twitching) because I thought it might me laced. Then some kid sat down next to him and said he'd buy the bag. When he found out the price he said he only had $45 and wanted to buy what he could with that. The guy gave hime maybe 5 grams and took off into the crowd. I started to laugh and the kid looked at me and asked what was so funny. I told him that he just paid for at least 12-14 grams and only got around 5. He got pissed and took off.", "After that I kept telling myself that my trip was going away and eventually it did. All in all it lasted about 3-4 hours and wore off. It wasn't fun at all. everybody else said that their trip was bad to and we decided to only trip in a place that was comfortable to us with people we trusted. That is my only bar experience I have had and I plan to trip on lsd over Christmas with a girl I'm good friends with. It didn't scare off of tripping but it made me be more carfeul of the situation I do it in.", "It was the Friday before Mother's Day when I and six of my closest friends each ate 1/8 gram of mushrooms. This was the first time for only one of my friends; luckily he had a great experience just like everyone else, that is until Ray tripped out.  It was a friend's birthday and everyone was back from school since it was the begining of summer.  Everyone was having a good time, just laughing and passing weed like candy, appreciating the good vibe from all of our friends who had reunited for the summer, except for Ray who refused to leave the couch which was secluded upstairs away from the rest of the party.  Everyone would check on him, but since it wasn't his first time eating mushrooms, we figured he would be okay.  ", "Then he started sweating and his skin was mad clammy and shit.  His eyes looked all bugged out and he looked like he was looking straight through me when I talked to him.  After about three hours of tripping pretty lovely, shit started going bad.  Ray said he was scared and he insisted that I not leave him.  He began babbling an incomprehensible gibberish as he finally got up from the couch to sit next to me on the foot rest.  He was a little bit too close for comfort as he put his arm around me, holding me like I was his bitch or something.  All he could say was, don't leave me.  But I was tripping hard at that point and I didn't want to waste my high in the grips of Ray's arms so I left.  I went into E's room where some folks were smoking more weed.  After I smoked, I went downstairs to have a cigarette in the patio in the backyard.  We chonged some more chiba on the patio and we were eating frozen berries and shit.  ", "That was when I saw Ray in the living room.  Before stripping completely nude he said, 'this is a reality check!'  I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I assumed that I was seeing things until he ran outside and began unleashing some serious blows to N's face and body.  I jumped out of the window into the backyard.  Ray followed and he went immediately to the pool where he walked in just deep enough to hide the view of his piece.  B walked toward Ray who was coming out of the pool and Ray said, 'look at my cock.'  Then he began to hit B intensely.  We wouldn't have been so scared to fight him had he not been naked and also a 6-foot-1-inch, 180-pound Taikwondo Black Belt.  ", "Everyone who was still left at the party began running like hunted animals.  I wasn't sure if Ray had a weapon at this point so I decided to just run away from him.  About five of some of my bigger friends were in the house trying to keep Ray under control, who was still hitting everyone in sight.  Finally J fuckin socked Ray who was running at him full speed until he fell to the ground feeling the pain of J's fist.  They immediately restrained him by holding his arms and legs that were kicking furiously.  This is when he started to speak as if he were possessed.  He would repeat the same phrases in random order.  He was saying shit like: 'This is perfection, I am Jesus, I am the center of the universe, I'm gay, Come lie with me, Daddy Mommy lie with me, black people, fingertips, Cock!!!' and he would scream at the top of his lungs between saying these horrid things.  He was spitting on everyone who was holding him down.  ", "Eventually we decided to send two people down the street to get D's father who is a doctor.  He immediately came to try to calm the chaos by taming this beast who I couldn't believe was the same person that I have known since kindergarden.  He duct-taped his feet together to stop him from kicking anyone.  Then we waited for the paramedics to come.  We were still tipping as we held Ray down.  He wouldn't stop saying all that fuckin psycho shit and he wouldn't stop spitting, which was almost as distubing as seeing him nude.  Two hours passed from the time that Ray was nude until the authorities came.  We were trapped in the house with that violent demon for two hours, which seemed like an enternity in mushroom time!  Finally they took the beast to the hospital.  That was only two days ago.  It's Mother's Day and I feel so bad for all of our moms for having to put up with this kind of bullshit.  Nobody has talked to Ray yet.  But tommorow many people who were there will see him again at school. The story is not over yet; we have yet to see how this experience will affect Ray.", "[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people.  Don't do it.]", "This took place eight years ago, when I was 20 years old.  From the ages of 18-22 I took either mushrooms or LSD about once a week, and have tripped only 3 or 4 times since then.  It began at a field party full of college students, about 100 people, most of which were tripping.  I ingested 4-5 grams of mushrooms, and was having an absolutely wonderful time.  Often mushrooms would make me feel very unsure if the setting was wrong (surrounded by non-tripping people, or trapped indoors in a claustrophobic environment).  ", "However, the vibes from the people were wonderful, and the beautiful night and large bon-fire all worked together to give an enlightening experience.  To me, that amount of shrooms was rather large, and my mind was definitely in another world.  But it was a beautiful world, as I was filled with a wonderful sense of inner-peace and joy that is somewhat indescribable with words.  Staring up at the sky, I felt at one with the universe and all of nature around me.  My mind was full of the deepest thoughts, and I could have sworn I had discovered the true meaning of life.  However, its times like these when the otherwise simple tasks become impossible, such as talking in a way that made sense to anyone but myself, or walking without thinking really hard about how to walk, or just simply functioning normally.  ", "I find it funny that many times previous to this I had bad experiences on shrooms on much smaller doses, as it all goes back to the fact that setting is everything.  I always felt that shrooms were best experienced outdoors, close to the trees and anything else nature oriented.  Also important is to be surrounded by like-minded people.  All of these things were present on this particular night, and my feelings were showing it.  ", "Unfortunately, things were about to take a very strange turn.  For a reason I cannot remember, as this was 8 years ago, my friend and I decided to leave.  This was out in the country, and we had about a 30 minute!", " drive back to my apartment in the city.  There was no traffic, and we were engaged in a conversation about how crazy it was that this substance was illegal, etc. etc. etc.  During those years I often sold marijuana, LSD, and mushrooms.  Since I did make alot of sales before the start of this party, we had in our posession many baggies containing 1-2 grams each of mushrooms, and about 25 hits of acid, and an ounce of pot divided in seperate bags.  I had never been in any trouble in my life, so I thought very little about getting busted.  I sold on a very small scale, and really only made enough to smoke free pot and take free mushrooms, and maybe some spending cash at the bar, as I was a poor college student.  Now back to the story.  We were quite oblivious to the world around us at this time, as we were peacefully enjoying this magical drive down the road.  I had a beer in my hand, and at this time the strange trip began.  ", "I swear on my life that all of this is 100% true, as I know it may sound somewhat unbelievable at times.  As I was taking a drink of my beer, I realized that out of nowhere (or so it seemed) there was I car to my right.  I glanced over and to my horror it was a cop.  I have no idea why he did this, but he pulled into a parking lot of some sort, and as we looked back we saw him pause and then start to come after us.  We had a quick moment as we went over a hill where we thought he could not see us, and we were grabbing all the little baggies of shrooms and I was quickly throwing everything out the window.  We thought we had gotten everything out.  ", "He followed us very closely for a mile or two, and then pulled us over.  We were now in a suburb area, and there was quickly 2 other patrol cars on the scene.  The first words from the cops mouth were 'did you guys really think I couldn't see you trying to throw beer cans out the window'  We were very happy to hear this.  As we stepped out of the car, they found about a 12 pack of beer, and on the floorboard a baggie containg a gram of shrooms.  A cop set it on top of the car, and announced to his fellow officers that we had a joint!!!  However, another cop came around and took a closer look, and announced that it was instead a 'stem and a cap'  They handcuffed us, and by this time I was really starting to freak out.  The lights of the cars were flashing everywhere, and it was a constant battle in my mind to try and deal with this forced reality.  My mind was unfortunately still in la-la land, thinking about what is infinite space and similar thoughts.  It was nearly impossible to keep cool.  I thought we were screwing up, but I guess we must have been acting ok.  ", "Before one cop reached into my pocket, he asked if I had any sharp objects which could cause him harm.  I replied 'not that I am aware of'  At the time I thought this was a perfectly reasonable answer, but he thought otherwise.  He demanded a yes or no answer.  I then said no, and all was well.  They put us in the patrol car and took us to the station.  We were then split up and put in seperate interrogation rooms.  ", "What happened now is strange.  We had no chance to discuss what we were going to say, but somehow we both said the same thing.  We said that at the party we used my friends car as the stereo, and many people we did not really know were going in and out putting in CD's to listen to.  Someone must have dropped it in the car.  They actually bought the story, as they figured we would not be stupid enough to get pulled over and leave drugs on the floorboard in plain sight.  They charged my friend with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, as he was 21 and there was beer in the car, and I was only 20.  They wrote out charges for posession of psillocybin(mushrooms), and said the charges and circumstances would be sent in and we may or may not be formally charged at a later date.  ", "The fact that we both said the same thing greatly aided our case.  During the interrogation, I was doing everything in the power of my mind to stay with the situation at hand.  The questioning cop was very close to my face, and the room was so small and incredibly light that his forehead appeared to be green, and at times I thought he seemed like a mere shell of a person, and not actually real.  After about 2 hours, they decided we were being honest enough and they let us go on a signature.  We called my friends girlfriend, and she came to pick us up as they had his car towed.  We then went back to where we threw out the drugs, and collected everything.  (We parked a ways away on a back road and approached from a different angle than the street.  ", "We were then sitting back at my apartment, smoking a joint, and realizing that the nightmare we had just gone throught was actually nothing more than a mere inconvenience to our trip.  We were never sent anything, and we were not ever charged in any way.  Even his contributing to the delinquency of a minor was never heard from again.  Needless to say, we never called to see why.  Getting arrested on mushrooms is definitely a strange trip indeed, far from the ideal setting.", "Well, I've always been a fan of psilocybin and I figured I'd share. This was a while ago, so bear with me :),", "Myself and four friends traveled into the night to our 'spot' (a grass covered hill overlooking my home town). An ounce of mushrooms were pulled out of a backpack and divied up to their respective owners. I got two 8ths of it. Previously we had bought some snacks as chasers, so the shrooms wouldn't taste so bad (a definite must). I got a candybar, put the shrooms on top and downed it. After I had consumed all of the mushrooms I sat there in the grass and anticipated the oncoming trip. After about 30-40 minutes I started to get an intense body trip. My friends watched me try to walk but fail, it was as if I had been drinking shot after shot until I could no longer control my speech or motor skills. I could lean on one friend and try to explain what was going on. They expressed little concern with my 'problem' and tried to get me off of them.", "Cigarettes. Lots of cigarettes. I had bought a pack and was already through more than half of it (note that I am not a heavy smoker at all) and wanted much more. Two of my friends began to wander off and they started grabbing the trees and pulling on the leaves (later on they explained they could melt the leaves and bend/stretch them however they wanted). By this time the drunk feeling had worn off and I was free to play around inside my head. I was sitting in the grass holding a flashlight I brought with me and flipping it in the air. I could not stop, the light was a part of me; if I tried to leave it behind, it would tug at my very being until I ran over to pick it up again.", "More cigarettes, I had now smoked about 30 cigarettes.", "Near the grassy part of the field was a narrow gravel road (about 10 feet away). Those 10 feet felt like 10 miles, it was unbelievable. It took seconds to travel there, but it felt like a great distance had been traversed. After exploring the distance thing a bit, I went to go lie down in the grass. I noticed my two friends were still gone. I was a little worried, but the crazy shit going on in my head was far more amusing.", "I looked up at the stars, the feeling I got from them was very similar to looking at the stars on weed, a big 'whoa.' Nothing new/special really. The trees, on the other hand, were growing to 600 feet tall and then would shrink to a few inches, very slowly and fluid-like. The fog was beginning to roll in, the lights from the town shown onto the fog and created a sort of swirling/flushing effect. The light would turn liquid like and blend with the fog and then just swirl, very plesant to look at. I went back to pacing and thinking about life in general and my life and how I lived it. I could look at things so much easier. I had floated above my corporeal self and was looking down with superiority over the mere mortal who stood before me.  He could not think of things that I could! Of course, it was me down there, but you understand (I hope).", "After experiencing this altered mindset I was frantic, I didn't want it to go away. I knew that eventually the mushrooms would wear off and I would be stuck in normal thinking mode. It sucked. After about six or seven hours we decided to go home (it was about 6am or so) My sober friend drove me back home. After I got home the fun was sucked out of the trip. My boring room, drab colors, my parents were in the house (not awake, but still present). My head started to feel very hot and uncomfortable, an intense feeling of 'bad' enveloped me, everything sucked. My friends were gone, I was back home, I had a bad headache (and what felt like a fever). I stared out of my room for about an hour and then tried to sleep. When I closed my eyes an intense swirling/dizzy feeling came over me. I hated that as well. I eventually nodded off to sleep. I woke up with a feeling of 'thank god that trip is finally over.' I was glad to be back in reality and anxious to give it another go. I have yet to do so, but I'll post my experience when I do.", "I was at one of my best friend's houses and his parents were gone for the weekend.  It was the first time we had decided to do shrooms during the day.  What a fantastic idea.", "Anyway, my friend and I had just shy of an eighth each.  We munched 'em down and chilled, as the typical body buzz began to creep.  About 20 minutes into the trip, I started to get intense visuals which mostly consisted of melting.  This was the first time that I had gotten melting visuals, so I stared at all the wonderful oddities in my friend's house in pure awe and amazement.  After about an hour of colors shooting out of paintings, wrinkles in leather couches undulating, and mounted fish coming alive, I began to hit my peak.", "At this point, things were getting so intense, I couldn't even get a hold of myself.  Every time I looked at anyone, or my own hands and arms, the normal skin seemed to be covered with a strange membrane (kind of like a baby mouse type skin).  I could barely keep my eyes open the entire time, for everything was completely out of whack, and I couldn't make the visuals cease.  They just kept getting stronger and stronger.  My friend's kitchen floor is made up of concentric octagonal tiles and as I walked through the kitchen, each tile would be of a different height as they shot up from the ground like pillars.  I laid down back in the TV room on the carpet, with the side of my face on the ground and watched the fingers of the carpet grow as they waved like the stalks in a wheat field.  Slowly, a white smoke, like that from dry ice, floated over the carpet enveloping everything, including me.  It was kind of hard to handle such an intense feeling of...I don't even know, maybe falling too far into a trip, so I went outside.", "It was the most beautiful day.  The sky was clear with scattered lines of clouds.  I sat in a lawn chair mesmerized by the foliage and sky as I drifted into a visually tantalizing trance.  My friend called my name and as I looked at him, his face had small silver BBs in each corner (the tear glands of his eyes, corners of his mouth, around his nostrils, etc.)  Soon enough, his entire head was made completely of sliver, shiny BBs, and I basically sat there speechless, not knowing what the hell was going on.", "The rest of the day was awesome.  I didn't explain much of my experience of being outside, but I most urgently suggest that y'all try shroomin' during a nice, warm day in the summer.  Boomin' at night and during the day seem to me as two totally different things.  Anyway, nice boomin', keep it real, peaceout.", "SET AND SETTING: ingested the sacrament at an old friend's apartment. Another friend of mine ingested an amount comparable to mine. I hadn't shroomed in just over three months as I had been feverously intent on indulging with a veritable purpose and the proper set of intentions. But as always and in spite of confidence, an elevated mood state and gregariousness, my entire being was permeated and taken captive by an overwhelming sense of trepidation as I never know whre the shrooms will take me. It can be likened to being blindfolded and escorted to a location you have never been to and the blindfold then being removed. ", "THE TRIP: About an hour to an hour and a half had passed and I was eagerly awaiting the lift-off effects to be felt. With each passing minute my body was feeling lighter and lighter. The world around me was beginning to diffuse and I awaited my imminent departure. There was around ten of us in the apartment and a consensus had been reached unbeknownst to me as a result of my rapidly fleeting ego that it was time to leave. So I scraped myself off of the couch and walked outside gingerly descending down each stairstep as I was being overtaken by a mild vertigo. ", "And then suddenly a strong gust of wind swept me off my feet and I was transported, catapulted rather, into another dimension. I came to an abrupt rolling touch down on a vast expanse of alien landscape. As I collected my senses and dusted myself off the adventure began. Despite the soft velvet black sky, the multitude and sheer magnitude of the streetlights were giving me a false sense of midday afternoon. The aforementioned streetlights were evolving concurrently as they rotated into mesmerizing polygonal diamonds. An undulating red-tinted transparent film was smeared across my field of vision. ", "Almost simultaneously an alternate voyage was ensuing within the confines of my mind. A brilliant, shimmering, intricate display of tunnels constantly flowing and mutating accompanied by an amoeba-like globule of interstellar protoplasm. The globule being superimposed upon the tunnels and then shifting to the side. A myriad of colors coalescing into a cohesive unit and then vanishing only to reappear later in their original form. ", "I then reverted back to the outside world and was set awag by a vista of lights stretching into the distance (vaguely akin to cell division) ad infinitum. The trip then changed gears without warning and I was blasted into a metaphorical self-contained concentration camp. My soul was turned inside out and my innermost thoughts and feelings exposed. They were dismantled and amputated from one another. Spread out across my entire field of vision, a panorama of sorts, encompassing my arete and engulfing my mind. Strewn about for an objective examination, each in turn, before being tightly packaged together again and reintegrated into my life. ", "Exuding an exogenous preoccupation with boundaries and rules put in place by society, I was distraught at my inability to follow them but then suddenly realized what a constraint these rules were to my individuation. These rules are partition walls to the conglomerate stratification and infinite void of reality. An evolutionary advantage it is to section off these layers of reality and live by the small slice that is so vital to getting ahead in this world. ", "There is a sturdy dam between my conscious and virtually unlimited unconscious mind. With each entheogenic exodus, this dam is chipped away at until it collapses and the floodgates to the mind can run freely for the barrier has been severed. ", "Now getting back to the series of events concerning my trip (pardon my discursive writing style). The perennial abundance of societal values subsided only to be replaced by some rather peculiar feelings towards my tripping partner. I felt connected to her as if we were kindred spirits. With this being only my third time seeing her I still didn't know her too well. But being free from superficial and thereby trivial ties to our arbitrary system of judgement, I did know her. In fact, I knew everyone and this epiphany gave way to an ambivalent yet complacent disposition within. Fear of others had been substituted with a sense of unity among manking. There is nothing to fear because when all our idiosyncracies and pathologies are put aside we are all human. ", "I emerge from this trip a more fulfilled individual, liberated from my haunting ailments. And I owe it all to responsible drug use, respect, purpose, intent and good company.", "The previous time I had taken mushrooms in a similar setting I had not dealt with the whole thing very well. It had been too overwhelming, too powerful and I had felt inclined to stop myself going mad. I was far too tense, but I had learnt from this. I needed, if I was going to cross the threshold, to let go, to forget my ego, let myself see what was on the other side instead of constantly trying to pull away from it. I find that the setting adds considerably to the content of your trip. I had been to the same place twice before, a 24 hour club that incorporated a play, some dance floors, a vast expanse of chill-out areas (many were shoe-free, alcohol-free and tobacco-free zones, which didn't bother me), a sort kind of street decorated with shop upon shop, which, as the evening progresses, becomes a central focal point to meet people or regroup. The whole thing is set in a mass of tunnels, usually used as car-parks, but which, for one night become another world. It is not so much a club, but more of a plain, a community which exists by the outside world but not with it. Once you are in, it does not feel like anywhere, and yet you are there. For me, it is heaven, a heaven with bad bits and good bits. The tunnels are virtually bear, and the only things that hide the crumbling brick and cement the place is made out of are the psychedelic stalls, painting, decorations, virtual D.J screens, and of course, the people. It all gets a bit complicated, but things will become clearer as the report progresses.", "I took the shrooms at 9.30 p.m, leaving about a gram to half a gram, for later. 5 grams is a lot, and I trying to get them all down my gullet as quickly as possible was challenging, so I decided to savour them, to enjoy them more, eat them slowly, and swirl them round my mouth so that I could really taste them. I found this had a good effect later on, since the whole trip seemed a lot more relaxed, less strenuous or stressful (than my last one had been). I rolled up a joint with the pollen, partly to avoid nausea, which I occasionally get with shrooms, and partly too relax me, to prepare me for the ensuing trip. I find that if you go into a trip stressed or anxious, that is the way the trip is going to be. If you go into one relaxed and thoughtful, the trip becomes more enjoyable, and it is easier to take in the sights at a slow pace, ignoring some if you want. In this way, you can help stop everything becoming too much too quickly. ", "The pollen was really strong, but not sleep inducing. It made me much more alert, more sensitive to sights and sounds. A haze had appeared around me, and everyone was part of it, breathing it in and out. It was totally benevolent, and I embraced it, taking deep breaths and exhaling very slowly. I suppose it is a form of meditation, and once I had finished I was at peace - completely relaxed. The next joint took me up. It was as if it was working in harmony with the mushrooms, they had become one. I let the flow of energy rise up and envelope me. I did not want to speak, I wanted to look at everything, concentrate on each thing and see what it was, what it was doing. A friend asked me what was happening, impatiently waiting for his 'shrooms to work', but I told him nicely to be quiet. At the beginning of a trip, it is helpful to be silent, and to try and get silence from others. Loud noises directed at you can divert your attention away, and put an annoying barrier between you and you visions, you new thoughts. For the twenty minutes, or however long you deem necessary, try to do this and I promise you it will help. It settles you in gently, allows you to prepare for more intense things to come. In a way, it is your introduction to the being you are going to spend the next 5 - 9 hours with. Be considerate, and observe, and everything will be all right. Once I felt focused enough I left my friends. I lit a cigarette, inhaled, and moved into the next stage. The walls that had once been grubby, uneven surfaces were now a mass of swirling, coiling, snake-like things, which formed beautiful patters. It was as if the bricks had come together to form an intense blue, very viscous liquid. I was afraid to touch it, so I just looked, and was happy just observing. For me, touching things can ruin my focus, but this is not always the case. I would like to be able to feel things, perhaps become one with them for a certain amount of time. I certainly have the ability to do this with other people; through touch you can bond with people in ways that are inexplicable, but beautiful. You can even get close to becoming one entity with them. I walked around for hours, staring, and then I noticed something I hadn't really payed much attention to before. I could talk to people with my mind, I didn't need to speak to them with my voice. Some people did not pay any attention to me, but with those that looked at me right in the eyes I could discuss things. It wasn't in English but we knew what each other meant. Sometimes what was thought had no form or idea, but we knew what was meant by it. You could tell wether or not you would like a person, whether or not they wanted to talk to you. I found myself looking for people to do this with, and once we had introduced ourselves, we resorted to ordinary speech. I would like to develop this further, and it is something I will really concentrate on over the next few weeks. It only really appears with hallucinogens, but it's great. For me, it's proof of psychic existence, and the power of the mind. It needs cultivating, but it could be used to great effect. It was my experiment throughout the trip, and I found that I could communicate in that way much more effectively with friends.", "Another thing I noticed was the unity of the whole place, it was as if people's minds were forming a great mass above their heads, filling the whole place. It was a 'combined mind', but like the real brain, it had many different parts. Each person was a separate part, but a section which work with others to produce the overall effect. This is the power of the place, and the reason why the whole experience is so different from anything else: your body is not important there, it's what you are thinking that's vital. The people who come in and don't let their minds and spirits go are the ones who don't enjoy it. If you don't let yourself become part of the experience you cannot enjoy what is happening. You have to let yourself go to understand what is going on. ", "On my travels through the 'caverns' I found many people - some were happy to be in my vision, others were not. That is the way things go. You won't connect with everyone, and not everyone will like you, want to bond with you. The best thing to do is not to let it bother you, and in that way you can avoid being upset or freaked-out in many situations. I just ignored, or left those who gave me bad vibes, even when it was difficult not to ask myself why they didn't want to be with me. With so many people in one place, it is impossible to find harmony in everyone. This can be used in the world as a whole. Bond with people you feel you have a connection with, have something to say with, and ignore or tolerate people with whom you don't. It's working for me. I think that each person can learn so much from a trip, if you go into it the right way, and travel through it in the right frame of mind. I have found that you must not take shrooms, or acid, or any psychedelics to escape, but to learn, to discover to explore. Forget how fucked you are, forget the pains and strains of reality, and glide through whatever it is that happens to you. What I found helpful was that whenever I got too worked up, or freaked-out, a joint really calmed me down. Rolling up gives you a focus, and smoking the joint allows you to sink back into yourself, to relax and find what you lost again. I always found a quiet place with some friends, and sat down for a joint. I'm sure many others do this, and would agree with me on this matter. ", "After a few hours of taking in the sights, patterns, sounds, smells and people around me, I decided to find somewhere to lie down and explore my own mind. I had to close my eyes for this - when you close your eyes you are officially in your own mind, and what you see is only relevant to you. It is very hard to describe what I saw, but I will try and remember exactly what was there, in my head. An important theme was 'the tunnels'. I was usually travelling forward, but often, I would be distracted by the colorful patterns warping and changing on the walls of the tunnels, and then I would start moving backwards, away from the light that I could see at the end of each one. It took and good deal of focus and determination, but I did get to the end, reached the light, and another vision was exposed to me. Sometimes they were horrible - screaming faces coming out of each other, eyes peering at me, then becoming figures dancing, which would expand out into walls made up of squares positioned in geometric patterns. After each set of visions, there was another tunnel and another struggle to reach the end. It slowly became easier, and eventually I was glided through, very fast, but enough to take in everything. Then everything came to an end, and I think I found my spirit. It was a head, very stiff, very upright, almost African looking. Sometimes it looked at me, other times it didn't, but it was there and it didn't change or shift like the others things I had seen had done. It was a statue, a goal I had reached. I opened my eyes, picked up my notebook, which already had stuff scrawled in it, and began to write again (this was REALLY HARD): here's a view things I wrote, there not very clear, but they might help you to understand how I felt during the trip:", "The train, holding onto the rails like they are the only things that exist in this molten, swirling void. Where do I start? I can't even write can't, it's not here, I'm here, are you in or out? Slipping, hold on to it and them - there/there. 'what are you, some sort of ventriloquist?'", "I think the train and its rails represents the entity that I grabbed hold of and got through all the tunnels really quickly. The tunnels are perhaps the molten, swirling void (I saw them in that way). I seem to be writing about things from the real world not existing where I was; 'Can't' is a good example. I just could not write it properly - it took numerous attempts to make it legible and to spell it correctly. I was there, but the words were not. I'm not to sure about the rest. The last thing I wrote was a quote from the play; I'm not quite sure what it means, but I'm working on it. After that i started scrawling geometric patterns onto the page. They were quite impressive, considering I'm awful at math. I could not stop, I kept swirling and spinning with the pen. There was a purpose, and after ten or so minutes it appeared: it was my guiding spirit. He appeared amongst the lines, and quickly I followed his outline and any others I could see before he disappeared. He is still there now, with some weird force, or what seems to me to be like life, spewing from his eyes and mouth. I'd like to show you, but I don't have a scanner.", "It was there that my visions ended, and I came out of the trip. I carried on smoking the pollen until there was nothing left. I was so happy, so fulfilled. I felt I really had learnt something that evening, or day, or night. The next time will be even better. (N.B. Any concept of time is what I perceived it to be after the event. During my trip, I had no idea of any time passing or going. It is unimportant, irrelevant to the journey. Ten minutes could have been an hour, half an hour, anything. They are only guesses.)", "I used to take magic mushrooms for fun with friends once or twice a year when I was younger. I had a few 'bad trips' in those days, I didn't know the history of psychedelics, or understand the sacredness of these substances. The last time I'd taken a small amount of mushrooms was 2 years ago, and I cried through the entire trip.", "My boyfriend had introduced me to DXM a couple months ago, and at 1st it blew my mind. I felt the spiritual possibilities of these 'alternate realities' at last. But it became something we did on weekends, for lack of anything better to do, a habit that did little more than gobble up precious hours of my life. Some kind of twisted logic or intuition (or denial?) in me decided that taking magic mushrooms this weekend would break me out of the rut!", "Our studio/condo in deep downtown (I would've preferred nature), Friday night.", "8:15pm - M and I split up a 1/4 ounce, putting aside a gram or so. I wanted to have a complete, deep experience, I had never taken more than a gram or so before. We chewed and swallowed the straight goods, and discussed our intent for the duration: healing and transformation.", "We had a cigarette and discussed taking a quick walk. By the time we'd made up our minds, effects were apparent. The luxurious purring body buzz and slight visuals had begun as we walked out the door.", "I felt mischievously daring as we strolled past a security guard in the courtyard. As we walked by a lovely ivy-covered church, I was awe-struck by dusky clouds and stained glass windows. My voice rang in my ears briefly, and the atmosphere of our surroundings shifted abrubtly with each new sound or voice nearby. I wasn't overly alarmed, knowing this tendency of psychedelics. I allowed myself to focus on the natural beauty of the park we were entering, fairly successfully ignoring passerbys. I felt that if I stood still and stared at anything too long, I'd be swallowed up and crushed by the immensity of beauty. I feared the looming conspicuousness of falling on my knees before lilacs and blossoming trees.", "We sat on a bench to have a smoke and comfortably stare at the trees. The lush leaves above were crystallizing into patterns, I could barely tear my eyes away. The joy rushing through my body was becoming too much to contain, and we agreed to head home. Walking back, the concrete was filling with mystical patterns.", "As soon as we closed the door behind us, we were howling with laughter and 'Holy Shits!'", "The next few hours are difficult to chronologically sequence. Part of the time was spent sitting at the table, more of the time lying in bed.", "At the table, I was facing a 5' tall painting I'd done, and it completely came to life! Not only were beings appearing and endlessly moving and breathing within it, but 3-D prismatic patterns emanated all around it. It seemed to me that the only words I could enunciate were 'WOW', 'Oh my GOD', and 'Holy Shit!', but at times, I'd snap out of a period of 'daydreaming', ask M if I'd actually been speaking aloud - and the answer was always 'yes'! I realized that there was no distinction in this state, everything I thought I was just thinking, I was also saying, there was no separation! M was also speaking, though I only grasped fragments, which seeded into my own reveries.", "The most unbelievable visions occured lying in bed, whether my eyes were open or closed. For the 1st while, an alien theme kept repeating. Aliens were questioning me, like reporters around a boardroom table, or attempting to examine me. I refused to be put into an inferior position, and felt that by laughing off some of their attempts, and casually humouring others, I retained a friendly equality. Eventually they went away. (As a child, I had re-occuring nightmares of everyone around me becoming aliens, they were always chasing me to make me one of them, and the only way I managed to make the nightmares stop was by giving in and becoming one of them. Is it possible my psyche has become strong enuf to stand alone?)", "After the aliens, mind-blowing artistic images appeared. I've been reading Alex Grey's 'The Mission of Art', and finally saw the grid-like nets of light that had inspired him and his wife during an acid trip. There were 3-D leathery black serpents woven like vines, colourful pen and ink etchings, and fantasy creatures reminiscent of Patrick Woodroffe's illustrations. Whenever I turned to look at M, I saw into his flesh, as if it was translucent and swimming with layers of underwater life. I began to nibble on his hands, and experiment with the feel and taste and strangeness. I made up words and laughed and laughed with my funny new language. I may have freaked him out a bit!", "The intensity of this part of the trip was all encompassing. Several times I asked M, 'Who are we?', 'Where are we?', 'What are we?'. I struggled with the concept of others, and whether they ever came 'here', and why wouldn't everyone want to.", "The 1st step down, after 3&1/2 hours of peaking, was an instantaneous knowing of Who, Where, and What. The effects were still very strong, and I began to want a break of normality. There were a couple more subtle yet instant 'drops', but each time I found I was still tripping pretty large. M appeared to be becoming paranoid about how he was coming across to me. We dealt with this uncomfortable phase for 1/2 an hour or so, then both seemed to reach a plateau of understanding.", "I was amazed at M's dish-sized pupils, and ran to the bathroom to see my own. I had always avoided looking in the mirror on psychedelics, since the 1st time, but now I was fascinated. I used to feel fear and revulsion seeing my face appear in stages of decay and unflattering mutations. But now, my massive pupils and glistening whites stared steadily back at me as I saw my flesh age, decay, rot, and repeat the cycle. This was deeply significant for me. I felt my fear of aging and death loosen its hold, lessening my attachment to this mortal possession, as I sensed that the divine energy/light within could never be extinguished, only transformed.", "A new view of life dawned on me. I've always been afraid that if I commit to one thing, I'll miss something else. Yet I realized I'll miss the truly important things if I don't surrender and commit to the paths my heart desires to follow. It's no longer so sad that I can only see and experience one version of my life, and that it feels so brief; it's eternal in the moments of true connection. I can only be the fragment of God/Universe that I am, no one else. Through commitment and caring, the deepest joys and sorrows and the truest aliveness can be accessed.", "We lay in bed and embarked on the most incredible conversational, philosophical, healing journey. All our hang-ups, our relationship to each other and the world, the workings of the Universe, the nature of God, all of our questions seemed so much easier to process and communicate. ", "I was surprised to notice how analytical, nearly scientific my outlook can be, and the unconscious nature of our belief systems. I realized how dogmatic I've been over certain issues, how blind I can be to my own nature! M's caring and beauty brought me to tears, and in a flash I saw the simplicity of unconditional devotion, and to me, it was the last straw of my fear of committing to him falling away, knowing a lifetime's choice was as simple as exhanging our soul-felt vows of devotion.", "There were so many realizations I can't begin to write about them all. I mentally thanked the spirit of this truly magical mushroom for such a kindly-feeling space to objectively (?) and forgivingly view hang-ups, make intuitive leaps so effortlessly, and communicate nearly fearlessly. It took longer than we'd bargained for to fully come down, it was 6am before we were able to sleep, ~9&1/2 hours since take-off!", "I've wondered if I'll retain the lessons I recieved during this unbelievably profound experience. So far, it's Sunday afternoon, 2 days since the trip, and my epiphanies still feel deeply embedded. I feel almost superstitious about going to that space again before I've seen if these understandings filter though in my day to day life, if I can be braver and truer to my intuition and life-path. I wouldn't treat this as something to get out of my mind on anymore, except in the most respectful sense! DXM has become quite unappealing by comparison!", "AN EXPERIMENT IN THE HOME CULTIVATION OF PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS", "*****************************INTRODUCTION**********************************", "The following is (more or less) an edited journal of my experience in the home cultivation of psychedelic mushrooms. When I finally decided to go ahead and try home cultivation, I found the archives to be lacking in information other than the basic 'How to Grow' files. As a result, I decided to record the process with the hopes that others will find the information useful.", "This journal is in no way meant to be a replacement for any one of the really good books and/or methods already available. That's right. I want you to have to trudge through the libraries and Net sites, just like I did. It doesn't only put hair on your chest, it forces to learn more than the process itself. At any rate, as you read on, you'll see that my anecdotal journal is of little use other than it's intended purpose. Namely, as a rough guide to first time growers who want to know the truth about how difficult home cultivation is.", "So that's enough BS, here's the journal. Each entry begins with the day it was entered. (ie: 13- Blahblahblah means the event happened on the thirteenth day after inoculation.) Any additional notes added during editing will appear in [square braces]. If you see me using 'We' and 'I' interchangeably, I'm doing so because I split the costs of the project with a couple of friends, not because I have any imaginary friends.", "*******************************JOURNAL************************************", "1- I recently received my package from PF [see my wholehearted endorsement of Psylocybe Fanaticus spores and method at the end of the journal], and today we managed to get all of the equipment we need. [The jars, substrate, and the pressure cooker. BTW, I borrowed my cooker from a friend's mother. It seems that everyone has one, but no one uses them. Be sure to ask friends before you shell out $$ for your own.] Because of the cooker's size, we sterilized 8 jars in two batches of four. We followed the standard PF recipe. We used approximately 0.2ml/hole. [This will make no sense unless you know the PF technique (see the PF section of the journal). BTW, the spores are psylocybe cubensis.]", "3- The first signs of growth. Tiny spots of fuzz have appeared at (roughly) the inoculation points.", "5- Germination results: Jar # of spots #1 7 [all spots are less than 1 cm^2] #2 5 #3 7 #4 1 #5 8+ [the plus means it's hard to differentiate spots] #6 8+ [single spots may really be multiple germinations] #7 10+ #8 7", "Looking good except for #4. I have a suspect contamination, but I'm not sure yet. I've marked the spot so I can keep an eye on it. I should start building the grow chamber soon. The proper heat, humidity, and sterility won't be found in my room. There's even dust particles starting to cover the jars. [I have a really dusty place]", "6- Jar #4 looks fine today. I guess it was just a late starter. The suspected contaminant looks the same, so I am starting to think that its only a wierd chunk of greenish vermiculite. The other jars are fine. The spots are starting to look feathery around the edges and are getting noticeably bigger every day.", "10- [I have hard data about the size of the spots, but since they vary so much (jar to jar), I'll generalize a bit to give you a rough idea.] The inoculation points are now clusters of growth. Each quadrant of the jar has numerous germinations, and they're starting to intermingle. Roughly speaking, each quadrant of the jar has a growth that ranges in size from 3 cm^2 to 9 cm^2. [I ran the numbers through a spreadsheet to give you an idea of how fast the initial colonization happens. At this stage, the jars ranged in coverage from %14 to %27 colonized. Quite a variance.] All jars are doing fantastic. The growths are definitely starting to feather radially towards the edges. Absolutely no contamination found in any of the jars. Preparations are underway to build a grow chamber. Total cost of the project to date: $65 CAN [All prices are in Canadian dollars]", "12- I measured the growths again today. [Sizes range from 5 cm^2 to 15 cm^2. The colonization percentages range from %39 to %80.] All measurements should be taken with 2 grains of salt. It's hard to measure irregularly-shaped growths in a cylinder with a straight-edged ruler. [I'll emphasize that yet again, so it hits home. My measurements won't be your measurements. If your growth is slower or faster, don't be surprised. We're talking biology here, nothing is guaranteed.]", "14- Most of the jars have mycelium all the way around the jar. [What I mean is that all of the growths from the four quadrants now touch each other.] A couple are expanding into the bottom. It looks like they won't be ready for the grow chamber on Sunday. [I originally projected that they'd be ready to transfer by a certain date, using available literature as a guide. Of course, I was way off...] I'll give them a few more days. Today we bought the materials for the growing chamber and built it. Total cost of the project to date: $100 CAN [See info about my terrarium at the end]", "17- Today is our original projected birthday [a PF term referring to the day you take the cakes out of the jars], but they aren't ready yet. Most of the jars (except #1) have mycelium totally covering the sides of the jars. [The reason #1 didn't was because only 3/4 of the inoculation points germinated.] A few have the bottom half-covered as well. Anyway, the birthday will have to be delayed a few days. On the bright side, [Joe Smith] found us an ultrasonic humidifier for $10 at a thrift store. [the original receipt was in the box: $150 in 1985 currency] Now we need to interface it to the grow chamber and buy a timer. Total project cost will now exceed $120 CAN, but not by much.", "18- Growth data as follows: [Basically, most of the jars were close to being colonized. Uncolonized areas were roughly 10-15 cm^2. Percentages ranged from %81 to %93. The differences between the jars have tightened up.] I got curious about how deep the mycelium penetrate, so I decided to take the worst jar (#1) and cut a sample out and do a little dissection. Sure enough, tiny fibrous strands penetrated the cake for at least 1 cm. [of course, this Curious George routine cost me in the end. Read on.]", "20- The growing chamber is complete. Man, is it nice. [see the end for details] The growth in the jars is really slowing down. It's taking days to fill in the last little bit of uncovered cake. As an experiment, I'm transferring #1 right now, to see how it fares. [You learn by doing, and sure enough, I learned]", "21- Since the jars are going so slow, I'm transferring half of the jars into the chamber tonight. [I thought they might be dying off in the jars because of the dramatic decrease in growth.] #'s 1,2,5,6 are going in. We have the timer programmed for 6 events/24 hours with each event lasting 5 min. [I chose a good cake, a bad cake, and two mediocre cakes to go in prematurely. They only had about 2-4 cm^2 left to go, so they were pretty much colonized.]", "23- Jars # 3,4,7,8 are going in today. Only #8 was truly %100 permeated with mycelium, but the rest doing well anyway. The first four I transferred are doing great, with increased fuzziness all over the cakes, especially the perimeter where the growth was incomplete. Small 'bumps' are starting to grow on them (start of pinning?), and I pulled off one 2 mm^3 chunk (primordia?). I crushed it, and sure enough, it turned blue within a minute or two. Things are looking good. The terrarium is fantastic, and today we tilted it (and added a spigot) so it can get rid of the condensation. (BTW, some of the bigger 'bumps' had brownish tips)", "24- I checked the cakes today. Pinning has definitely started on all eight cakes. The original four are a shitload bigger than yesterday, with some pinheads growing 5-10 times larger [by volume] in just a couple of days.", "25- We elevated all of the cakes by inverting the bands. Now they'll be above any water that might pool from condensation, and nothing will impede the progress of mushrooms growing from the bottom.", "26- Today, we had to remove #6 from the terrarium due to mold infection. I removed the infection with a sterile knife, but I'm dubious about the possibility of saving it. We will have to keep a better eye on the rest. [We separated this cake from the rest by putting it in a pot with saran-wrap over the top, and misting it manually. The mold spot grew in a previously uncovered part of the cake. Let this be a lesson: Let the jars colonize completely. If you do what I did, you may jeopardize the whole project.] The growths on the other cakes are as big as 2 cm long and 1 cm in diameter.", "27- Another death today. This one was a much slimier looking green mold. It took hold at the vermiculite/substrate interface [the bottom of the cake]. It was jar #1, so I'm not surprised. Anyway, I cut it out and put it in with #6 for a few days of intensive care. [John Doe] sampled a few grams (wet) of primordia and he said that he had what amounted to a prolonged 3-beer buzz [canadian beer]. He wanted more, but we didn't want to decimate the cakes. The precise quantity is unknown [we didn't get access to our scale in time], but we have a rough idea. I'd like to double the dose and try again, but that will have to wait until the cakes produce some more shrooms.", "29- R.I.P. We had to bury one of the cakes today. The mold (although removed) returned in too many places to save it. I decided that the infection was too severe to attempt additional rescue attempts. Unfortunately, I threw it out before dissecting it for informative purposes. Maybe if the other one dies, I'll remember to analyze it first. As far growth goes, things are going well. The ones in the grow chamber are starting to get that kind of 'foamy' growth at their bases. By Monday, I will (hopefully) be able to sample some for myself.", "31- Holy shit they're huge! We now have mushrooms as large as 65mm by 15mm [total length by cap diameter]. Of the six cakes, we have all of them producing roughly a half-dozen large [normal sized really, but large compared to the primordia] mushrooms each. Some veils are broken, and others are on their way. The rate of growth have been on the order of 2X/day [doubling their volume each day], so I don't expect that kind of growth to keep up. The cake in intensive care re-grew mold again, so we're going to let it go, and see if it takes over, or gets overtaken by the shrooms. [I think we were erroneous in our ID. What we saw was probably just a bluing reaction from the surgery, rather than a re-growth of mold.] Tonight, [John Hancock] is going to be our second guinea pig. We gave him roughly 3 mushrooms approximately 55 mm long with caps 15mm in diameter. He compared the high to a 6-pack buzz. No major visuals, but since we don't have our scale yet, we deliberately underdosed him.", "32- The cake in intensive care is doing well. The hole [from surgery] has been overgrown. Hopefully we will be able to put it back in with the others in a couple of days. Tonight I'm going to try some for myself. I'm taking four mushrooms approximately 70mm long with caps 23mm in diameter. I ate them raw to see what they taste like. As expected, they tasted like raw mushrooms. Either you like them, or you don't. The trip took about an hour to kick in [I had just eaten dinner], and it peaked about 3 hours later. I had mild tracers and wall-bubbling, and for a while I closed my eyes and listened to some tunes. In the darkness, I had some wild mental imagery going on, and a good time was had by all. I found this to be a comfortable first dose. [I'm 5'11' 180lbs]", "33- The isolated cake is A-OK. In fact, I pulled 2 shrooms off of it today so [Joe Blow] could try some over the holidays. It seems to be all healed up, and I see no reason to not put it back into the grow chamber. The other shrooms are just huge. In fact, I picked about 15-20 shrooms off the cakes because they were mature enough to eat. (the veils had ruptured)", "34- I picked off another 10. The cakes are starting to look bare, but we have to pick them as they get ripe. Each cake still has 4-8 shrooms each on the way.", "48- I got back from vacation 2 days ago and the shrooms looked neglected. The spores were everywhere, and things were starting to shrivel with age. The cake in intensive care is dead. [Joe Smith] left it out to dry for over a week. More have been picked and dried, but I've lost count now. The humidifier was on the blink, so [Joe Smith] left it on overnight to see what would happen. Huge growth! We're going to try this kind of supersaturation for a while. [After a couple of days we stopped the experiment. The increased growth rate wasn't worth the hassle of filling the humidifier up twice a day, rather than 1-2 times per week.] I took the humidifier apart, but I couldn't see what the problem was. It seems to work fine now anyway. [Joe, John and Jane] ate the dried ones in a tea. I figure they had 22 shrooms of various sizes between them. They had a very strong trip. We are trying to make a spore print of 3 caps we picked yesterday. I have yet to see how it is going. [It turned out great. The prints were very strong, and the spores later germinated with no sterility problems.]", "60- I haven't bothered to make any entries lately because not much has happened. Every day I pick about 5 shrooms off of the 6 remaining cakes. The other intensive care cake dried out and died because I went away for a week. The rest of them are doing great. We made a spore syringe and successfully inoculated another four jars, so now we officially have an endless supply of shrooms. The 6 cakes have been producing for about 3 weeks now, and we've grown enough to trip 20 people. It has been well worth the investment.", "So there you go all of you nay-sayers. Home cultivation is not only possible, but it's really pretty easy. I went from spores to edible shrooms in about a month. Of the original 8 jars I inoculated, I lost one of them to infection, and one to negligence. The problems stemmed from my own stupidity, not because it's 'hard' to grow your own shrooms. If you have the time and inclination to try it yourself, have no worries about losing your money. In my mind, the project paid for itself completely within 2 months, and anything it produces from now on is gravy.", "**************************PSYLOCYBE FANATICUS*****************************", "I give full credit for my successful cultivation project to the source of the spores, and the growing guide: Psylocybe Fanaticus [www.fanaticus.com].", "I can't endorse the company enough. I sent them my order in the middle of the week, and I received my package 12 days later (including weekends). Not bad for an international order. (PF is in the US, I'm in Canada) Needless to say, although buying spores is perfectly legal in Canada and most US states, none of this was done in my name. (But that's just common sense.) BTW, I did this in October 1994, and many others have ordered since then, so the company is still active. [still going - July 95]", "If you do order from PF, make sure you order their Science Reports. It's only $10, and although it's only 16 pages of photocopies, those 16 pages contained information that I haven't seen in any book or on any Net site. (Except for the idiot who reprinted it without PF's permission. If this joke really thinks information deserves to be free, maybe someone should post his credit card number to the net...) It's PF's technique that makes the process foolproof. Although I could spill the beans in less than five lines, I won't. They deserve to make a few bucks for their ideas.", "I don't know if they've updated their brochure, but for those of you outside of the US, PF charges $10 for shipping and handling on all syringe orders. It not an unfair charge, but the fact that it wasn't in their brochure caught me off guard.", "***************************THE TERRARIUM**********************************", "Ahhh, my terrarium, a thing of beauty it is. This is the place my cakes reside, being bathed in a gentle mist of water vapor while fresh air sweeps away excess CO2. But enough of that, here's the facts:", "Equipment [all dimensions approximate] Cost (canadian $)", "=========================================================== ", "NOMA 6-event 24 hour digital outlet timer $30 =========================================================== ", "I don't expect you to be able to find an ultrasonic humidifier for $10. We got lucky in that department. A new one is well over $100. But with the set-up we currently have, mushroom growing is effortless. At this stage, it's a matter of filling the humidifier reservoir every week, and emptying the jar that collects the condensation runoff. Other than that, it's on autopilot. Every couple of days, we check on them to remove the ripe shrooms for drying, but that's it.", "I've recently helped a friend set up his own terrarium, and after calling around, he managed to find a couple of 2nd hand stores that had humidifiers for less than $10. They were the rotating-cone type of atomizer which may not be as good as an ultrasonic, but were suitable for the job. So shop around, a humidifier is worth the time and expense.", "The construction of the terrarium is pretty straightforward. You cut a hole in the lid of the cooler where one of the plexiglass sheets goes, and caulk the sheet into place. Keep the chunk of styrofoam you cut out. You can put it in the bottom of the cooler to keep the cakes away from any water that might condense. You put the second sheet inside the cooler to make two chambers (a la the PF terrarium), but since I don't use the spray bottle, I didn't really need it, but you might. I found that my cooler came with a small lip about halfway down the the inside. I rest one edge of the plexiglass on the lip, and the other edge towards the top. This gives the little guys more head-room, thus more space for more cakes.", "The humidifier is plugged in via the timer, so I leave the humidifier power on and use the timer to regulate the misting cycles. The humidifier has a fan built in to blow the atomized water out the top, so I took advantage of that feature, and used it flush the air in the cooler. I have a duct running from the humidifier into the side of the terrarium (near the top). It's that white clothes-dryer type of tubing. It looks like a slinky wrapped in a white condom, and it is caulked into place to prevent leakages. The cooler is tilted towards one corner where I have poked a hole in the cooler with the tube from a pen. I left the tube in there, and it acts as a spigot to funnel all of the condensation run-off into a jar.", "So that's it. That's my terrarium. After I built it, I had to program the timer to come on every four hours, for fifteen minutes each time. I found that that was sufficient to keep the plexiglass misty-wet. The mushrooms love it too, and if the mushrooms are happy, I'm happy.", "I've heard about PF's cheap humidification scheme, and although I haven't tried it personally, I've been in contact with others who have used it. In a nutshell; It's not as good as an ultrasonic humidifier, but it's better than spraying by hand. It's cheap, so you might want to try it out, but if you want some serious humidity, splurge and get a decent humidifier.", "********************************DOSAGE*************************************", "Since not many of you have access to gram scales, and don't want to spend the money to buy one, I'll tell you the system we use to measure out doses. First off, the method of preparation we use is to dry out the shrooms thoroughly (sun-dry or chemical dessication), and pulverize them into a semi-fine powder. (1mm diameter and smaller, about the same size as coarse salt) You might find that the stems don't crush so easily, so I sometimes mince them up with a good knife.", "Lately, I've started to use a coffee bean grinder like PF suggests, and it works great. Don't grind them too long or else they turn into a fine powder. When you grind them you'll find that it kicks up a cloud of mushroom dust inside the grinder. Take a sniff; it will be the most sickly sweet smell you'll ever experience.", "After pulverizing the shrooms, I went to a laboratory on campus and used their gram scale that is accurate to 1/100th of a gram. I measured out 1 flat teaspoon (5ml) and weighed it. On average, it weighed 0.80 grams. Using this as a guide, we tried 1.5 tsp (1.2 g) of shrooms each and the trip was quite nice. Just recently, I tried 2 tsp (1.6 g) of shrooms, and lost touch with reality (in a good way), so I would recommend 1.5 tsp to begin with. Of course, this dose is particular to my strain of shrooms, the freshness, and the water content, so your mileage might vary. Generally speaking, shrooms that have been dried within the last week or two will be much stronger than an old stash (presumably due to psylocin breakdown).", "I personally recommend mushroom tea as my preferred method of ingestion. I've tried them fresh, dried, cooked, and in tea, and above all, tea is the best way to go. What you do is bring a cup of water to boil in a pot, then add the powdered shrooms. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for about 15 minutes. Stir the shrooms around as it steeps so the psilocybin and psilocin diffuse throughout the water. After 15 minutes, pour the mixture through a tea sieve to strain out the pulp (we like to call it the slurry). And what you have left is a steaming cup 'o goodness. Add sugar, honey and/or milk to taste and drink away. It doesn't taste too bad, although the color and smell may not win any awards. If you drink it on an empty stomach, it will hit you *fast*. In fact, when I first did 2 tsp of shrooms, I had major visuals in 10 minutes, and auditory hallucinations within 30 minutes. (After an hour, I met god...) The GI tract is much better at absorbing water than it is at digesting solids, so the effect is both immediate and powerful.", "**************************QUESTIONS & ANSWERS******************************", "Q: Won't handling the cakes contaminate them? A: Not to my experience. You never handle the cakes until they mycelium has completely permeated the cake. When this happens, there is no exposed substrate for foreign mold spores to take hold of. Of course, this is the reason why you shouldn't remove the cakes from the jars until the cake is totally covered in white. Also, make sure you scrape off *all* of the top layer, right down to the hard white substrate (this only makes sense for the PF technique). Don't give mold a place to grow. So in a nutshell, yes, you can touch them if you have to, but excessive handling is not advised.", "Q: How much can I expect to grow? A: The cakes don't produce constantly for their whole growth cycle, so it's hard to give you any concrete numbers. Right now, my cakes are half-way through their expected fruiting life (they've been fruiting for a month). In the last two weeks, I have produced roughly 12 dried grams from 6 active cakes. That works out to 1 dried gram per cake, per week. A typical dose ranges from 1-2 g, so it's reasonable to expect 2 cakes to produce enough for a person to trip once every week. That should be a good guide when it comes time to decide how many cakes to grow. I will try to get more data on the life cycle of the cakes, and give a more concrete estimate of production.", "*****************************CONCLUSION************************************", "So there you have it. That's just about everything I can say about the mushroom growing process. All of this information is first hand, and is as accurate as possible. I hope you found it informative, especially if it helps you to decide to try it yourself. Although growing is not totally effortless, it's certainly not as difficult as some people who post on the net make it out to be. Personally speaking, the project cost us about $150 CAN, and since we've already consumed 20 doses at $10/dose, it has already paid for itself within 2 months.", "I'm sure some of you will have questions or comments. If you have something to add, or if you want me to clarify some part of this file, please email me at: an183998@anon.penet.fi", "I will try to answer all of your questions, or incorporate your suggestions into an updated version of this text. Since I'm using a borrowed account, my responses might not be lightning fast, but I'll get around to them as soon as humanly possible.", "The best way to grow shrooms is to grow a species which is native to your climate.  When you've fruited as many caps as you can, just throw the spawn outside and let nature do the rest.  Two species which are particularly hardy are P. Cubensis in warm climates, and P. Cyanescens in temperate areas like the Pacific Northwest.", "Sterile technique is required for germinating spores, especially if you start with a petrie dish of agar. This method is preferred because you can select the best mycelia to transfer to the growing medium but requires some practice to maintain sterility and extra cost for the equipment (petrie dishes, agar, scalpel, alcohol lamp).  You can start the spores directly on the growth medium, but you have no control over quality.", "The most important thing about sterile technique is to clean everything twice.  Take a shower, wipe down the work area with soap and water, then spray it and yourself with Lysol or some other disinfectant.  This doesn't take more than 10 minutes and will almost insure success. I usually work nude from the waist up to keep dust from clothes from getting involved. If you wear clothes, make sure they are freshly laundered. Work in an area without a draft, and use a glove box (best case), or on a flat table underneath some sort of cover to protect from stray contaminants from falling down.  Keep the lids on the jars or petrie dishes and only open them for the minimum time necessary to add spores or transfer mycelia to another jar. Don't make any sudden moves, though, as this causes drafts and may lead to contamination.  Use a pressure cooker, and sterilize at 15 lbs for at least 30 minutes. I generally go for an hour.", "For growth medium, I use birdseed without sunflower seeds for P. cubensis.  It's easy to sterilize because it's smooth without a lot of nooks and crannies for bacteria to grow in, plus it's easier to shake apart later.  This is important, because once you have a jar or two of healthy uncontaminated mycelia, you can use them to inoculate at least ten jars each of fresh growth medium.  Once the mycelium has completely saturated the growth medium, transfer it to a larger container for growing.  At this point, sterile technique is no longer required as the mycelia generates its own fungicides which keep other contaminates from growing.  Use an open box or carton so you can easily get to the mushrooms when they sprout. ", "Apply the casing layer to the spawn, and keep watered. When the mycelia has permeated the casing layer, drop the temperature about 10 degrees to induce fruiting. When picking, use a razor blade or other sharp implement to cut the fruit close to the soil.  Make sure you don't damage any of the pinheads which will eventually grow to full size.  You should get two or three flushes of mushrooms over the next couple of weeks. When no more caps fruit, toss the contents outside in a shady area and wait for next year.  You might also want to make some spore prints of your own. To do this, cut off a mature cap and place on a piece of paper.  Cover the cap with a glass or cup and let sit for a couple of hours.", "Me and one of my best friends decided to shroom out one night. So i head over to a neighboring town and buy a half ounce of shrooms from him, and a nice bag of aco poco gold weed which is dank weed. The friend i was tripping with had to work so i waited and smoked a couple of bones until 6p.m. when he got out. I called up my friend with a car and told him to come get me so we could pick up my friend who was working. We picked him up and headed back to his house for a night of fun. We both grabbed a big glass of orange juice and munched down our shrooms. My friend ate about 3.5 grams of shrooms, because he was low on flow and couldn't afford any more. I decided to take a quarter ounce (7 grams), a couple of other friends showed up so we went out to his little shed type thing and we smoked a couple of bowls, of dank nugs. More people showed up and it was getting crowded in the shed. We smoked some more and just sat around and laughed and talked. It was about 1/2 hour and i decided to eat a couple more grams, i wasn't sure exactly cause i left my scale at home but it was around 1.5-2grams more than the 7grams from earlier. About another 15 minutes to a half hour i was tripping out hard core. I didn't know what was real what was fake i couldn't talk or walk or do anything to function i just stared into nothing. ", "I was really freaking out and i was having trouble breathing so i decided to just leave on my own cause i could not handle the environment and i thought it would be better if i go home. So i get home i can barely walk from the car to my door i stumble in the house and go right up to my room. [Erowid Note : Please people...do not drive while tripping. It is _extremely_ dangerous and irresponsible.] I just laid in my bed freaking out i thought i was dying i thought i was going to hell i couldn't handle anything. I am an experienced druggie i have pretty much done everything except heroin, so i decided just to handle it and not call 911 or tell my mom what was going on. I just sat laying in my bed praying 'god please don't let me die,' i kept saying it over and over again. I could not concentrate on one thing everything was moving, i tried closing my eyes but it was just like a tunnel of colors i could not get out of. I could not feel any part of my body i took one of my hands and tried touching my leg and i could not feel it at all. ", "It had been about an hour into my trip and i was really freaking out all i could think was i wanted this to go away. I decided to try to pass time i jumped in the shower with all my clothes on and then gradually undressed even though i was already soaking wet. I turned the shower into a bath since i couldn't stand up well. I sat down and everything was still moving in great motion and i was just trapped in some world. I could feel my heard like coming up my throat and beating very fast. I decided for some odd reason that i should shave my whole body, and that would get me out of this insane trip, so i did and every time i shaved a line the hair would grow right back, well at least i was hallucinating that it did and that freaked me out so i jumped out of the bath soaking wet and put my clothes back on that were wet too. I exited the bathroom and my mom looked at me puzzled, i told her i didn't feel good and i needed to sleep, she didn't happen to mention why my clothes were soaking. When i was talking to her her face would change and melt off and change colors and i was so paranoid that she knew that i was tripping, so finally she left me alone and i went back into my room. ", "My body would keep twitching as i lay in bed i kept trying to do different things to try to relax me but none worked, i would turn on music but that would be too much for me and i couldn't handle it. Once i shut the music off, i kept hearing my close friends talking to me, but i couldn't see them it was very scary. Its been about three hours of hard core tripping and it really scared me i decided to smoke a bowl to relax me, but then i just started to peak. I went back to my room and laid down again saying 'its gonna be over in a few hours just wait it out you don't need to call 911.' My mind was completely shot, i think i may have even died for some minutes or something. what i remember is trying to concentrate on one thing and it just wouldn't happen. When i looked at something my mind could like not comprehend what i was seeing like my mind and body were in two different worlds and they wouldn't come together. For the rest of the night i sat there praying and staring at the clock until 2a.m. when i pretty much stopped tripping. All i have to say is stick to the normal 3-4 grams of shrooms this was the scariest experience of my life and i will never eat that much shrooms again, just be careful, thanks for reading this, your druggie friend", "What: 4+ gm freshly dried, small, P.c., plus ~6 gm just picked Blended with juice, drank on empty stomach Who: some total stranger Where: home alone Why: fun, recreation (literal meaning) Set: open to any teachings, but no notion of what form they may take", "Started off trying to play piano, as it began to hit hard, gave up and laid on the floor.

Then I'd launch down memory lane, coming back to the present with a thought like 'gee, I did kind of a half-assed job on that at work today', then off to somewhere else in my life's history. This continued for ~ half an hour, with me not feeling sorry for myself or down on myself, yet at the same time thinking that my life, or my way of living it, could be better.", "I flashed on something I had started to work on last week, on a much milder trip with my significant other. I wanted to make my mind like an infinite plain, where no thoughts could hide, and everything was right there in the open, on the same level. At the time, told this to ML, who is much more psychologically oriented than I, and she said she was spending lots of her trip watching her brain think about itself.", "Back in the 'here' and 'now', I put those 2 concepts together. I started thinking about my thoughts, and watching them be thunk,. This set up some kind of infinite recursive feedback loop, and all of a sudden, WHAM! I was pushed over to the other side, into the ineffable, unknowable,undescibable God Zone. Conscious thought was a completely impossible miracle, and I was right there, in the eternal now. Self evident cosmic truths came bubbling up, like:' It just is.' ' Why? Because.' And my favorite: 'So?........So What!' which begat a giggling fit.

Well, it wasn't like that. My mind was so melted, and feverishly thinking, but not about anything. There was no fear- sometimes an idea would pop up like 'I've totally lost it, I'm crazy, and I'm never coming down'. To which came the response 'So?...... So What!' I was completely beyond any emotion other than ecstacy. The more I tried to think about it, the more I tried to think at all, the more awestruck I became. The whole world was based on thought, perception, awareness, consciousness- it exists, life exists, cause we _know_ it does. Where does this awareness come from, where does it go when our bodies die? This busy happy bubbling God Soup, that's where.", "After a while, my body got restless, so I stood up and wandered around the dark house. There were some token trippy effects, that, another time would have been quite engaging: beautiful complex 3D patterns, odd perceptual changes. They almost seemed beside the point. Looked outside- the sky was strikingly beautiful.", "After an eternity, or a couple of seconds, or a couple of hours by the clock, my brain started getting tired. More work than you'd think, this God stuff. I realized I was coming down- an hour ago I thought it would be impossible to _ever_ come down!

My boyfriend convinced me and I agreed on the condition that I would take less than 1 gram.  Unfortunately, he is the type who believes more is better and gave me 3 grams, without telling me.  I enjoyed it at first.  I would see things move and then make them stop, then make them move again, then make them stop.  After a while however, I couldn't make them stop, which scared me quite a bit.  I didn't like not having control over what I could see and couldn't see.

I couldn't remember my mother's name, what she looked like.  Soon, I couldn't remember anyone's name.  I became increasingly scared when my boyfriend spoke on the phone.  As far as I was concerned, there was no outside world.  I thought that my dog had eaten some shrooms off the ground and was scared like I was, and cried for about an hour, apparently.

My headaches were so intense and painful, that my doctor believed that the pain (which was accompanied by terrible nosebleeds and loss of vision in my left eye) was caused by a brain tumor.  I was prescribed a popular migraine medication, but it had no effect.  I began smoking marijuana on a regular basis, and it eased the pain, but nothing could prevent it.  When I had to stop eating handfuls of ibuprofen from fear of endocrine failure, I stumbled upon an article about  some chronic headache sufferers using mushrooms and acid to treat pain.

I had just finished the dose at about 7:45 PM when I felt something poking me in the ass. It felt like a staple. I checked, and there was a screen for my pipe stuck to the elastic of my underwear. I wondered how it had gotten there and how long I'd been wearing it around, and then just dismissed it as one of those odd things that happen to you when you're tripping.", "I started feeling the effects at about 8:15. I felt I was being pulled into trance, so I got as comfortable as possible in the closet and closed the door. I was having some crazy auditory hallucinations, buzzing and bubbling sounds that produced accompanying visuals. Then I heard The Noise. The Noise was a high-pitched electrical 'zzzzzzzap!', and when I heard it, I felt as if my brain had been lashed with an electrical whip. It was painful and scary. I tried to find its source, but in my condition it was impossible. I couldn't even tell if it was coming from me or somewhere else. I tried to contact the mushroom entities to ask them about it, but they pushed me away. Confused, I pulled myself out of the trance to try to figure out what was going on. When I got out, The Noise stopped. I thought maybe turning off the lights would help, and I decided to try being in another room. I went into my bedroom, put the computer on its grooviest screensaver, got comfortable and went back into trance.", "Zap! The Noise was back, louder and more painful than ever. I turned off the computer and tried again to contact the mushroom entities. There was no response. I moved again, into the living room. I laid down on the couch and drifted back into trance. The Noise was still there, but I felt I could control it somewhat by changing my thought patterns when I heard it. I also noticed that it manifested itself whenever I started to fall asleep. I felt better and began enjoying the trance. I spent a lot of time thinking about those people that I love, seeing things from their points of view. However, I didn't have much choice as to what I was allowed to think about; I had wanted to try some experiments during this trip and I didn't have the opportunity. I was a little disappointed until the next trance.", "This time the mushrooms were there. I immediately sensed their presence, and was filled with their omnipresent love and warmth. They were happy and goofy and being with them made me giggle. They tried to show me jokes- my mother-in-law's existence, for example, was shown to me as the product of some kind of Cosmic Silliness. I told them that my husband was planning on tripping soon, and they replied that they looked forward to seeing him, but they seemed to find that hilarious too. They also told me that I should apply for a certain job, and gave me the idea that my working there would be highly amusing to them. I didn't quite get the jokes, but I giggled anyways (it was impossible not to). I asked the entities why they had pushed me away earlier and they said, 'You needed to think about that stuff by yourself.' I came out of this last trance at about 11:45 chuckling and full of love and happiness. ", "This was a scary trip in some ways- searching for the mushrooms only to find that they weren't talking to me for most of the trip, and I never did figure out what The Noise was or where it was coming from. Overall, I learned a lot about myself and those I love and I don't regret the experience at all.

Person had covered the jars with paper towels to allow air exchange, but will not be doing this 'next time.'", "Well, that's what I've heard so far.  What's it mean? Well, it is possible to cultivate your own.  From what I've read from what people have sent, it would seem to be best to be as paranoid as possible about sterility.  A recent posting mentioned the use of a 'glove box'- you would have a transparent lid on a box, with gloves on one side you could put your hands in to work.  The inside of the box would then be sterilized, and all transfers of spores would be done inside this box.  I don't know if one would need to go that far, but definitely avoid drafty rooms, spray down with Lysol first, wear a mask, etc.", "Also, the brown rice method DOES work, apparently with a decent amount of success.

I was completely lost in my thoughts, and one pattern that recurred throughout the entire night began at this point.  This pattern was my propensity for deep self-reflection.  I spent a lot of time in front of the mirror, thinking about how I go through life playing a character and how other people saw me.

Once, about an hour into our trip, we went outside just for fun.  The entire world was frozen over and many of us were having visuals, so being outside was pretty entertaining.

After about 1 hour I realised that I'm having visions. First it started with colorful geometrical patterns and a rush of relaxing pleasure. At this point I decided to go to bed because I knew that it's going to be intense. What followed was 6 hours of intelectual ORGASM. I chose 'ofortuna' music background, which played in my mind over and over. I was transferred into the world of angels. Particularly one angel. His name was Satan. I expected scary encounter, but no, he was magnificent, beautiful, sophisticated and genius. At this point I realised that of course he was this way, how otherwise he would manage to make other angels join him in his rebellion against God? I wanted to join him too, however I decided not to. He is a liar, and by knowing the effects of his deeds I knew that he is wrong. Because of him, humanity suffered tortures, for that reason alone I couldn't forgive him.

It was certainly mind expanding.", "At about 7:30 P.M., I walked a short distance with my family to a friend's apartment, where I ingested about 5 grams of powdered mushrooms in orange juice. After I choked down as much of the mushrooms as I could (About 1/4 of a gram remained- I was certain that if I tried to finish the remaining dose I would vomit), I returned to my apartment, leaving my family at our friend's apartment. I had eaten only half of a sandwich that day, and I anticipated that the effects would set in relatively quickly.", "How right I was. Within fifteen minutes, the effects of the mushrooms were obvious.

Dolphin brains / The grey matter /this is the fabric of our existance / There is only one thought / I have already written these things many times / All of this is a spark /Everything Is / Everything Becomes'", "I found the 'Everything Becomes' remark to be very striking, and I giggled at the comment for quite a while..", "This is the part of the trip where my memory starts to get a little fuzzy.", "I remember getting a shower, grinning and laughing like a 4-year old. I was saying things like 'I can do whatever I want, if I don't like it, I can change it..' over and over again. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if my eyes were opened or closed, the visual hallucinations being very intense (The lights were even turned on).. I turned off the water, but remained in the shower for an undetermined amount of time. I remained naked, and found my way out to the living room, where I laid down on the couch.", "I laid perfectly flat on the couch, absolutely still. I felt as if I was nothing, the Universe was nothing, and all I had to do was simply Be. I spent a great deal of time Being. ", "I emerged from the trance, unsure of who I was, where I was, what was going on, or why I felt the way I did. I had a number of disturbing thoughts, such as 'I must be dead- I've always known it would happen to me, here it is..' I saw my 3-month old daughter, and heard a voice telling me that I had, in a way, become her, and that I might as well be dead because I had fulfilled my purpose on this planet. Still yet another voice was telling me that I was not actually dead, but was just now experiencing life for the first time. Another voice told me that the Universe had just came to an explosive and violent end and that I was sitting in the twisted wreckage, and another voice told me that I was entirely responsible for its destruction. Confused and frightened, I threw on some pants and a sweater and ran as fast as I could to get my family.", "I arrived at my friend's apartment in a matter of seconds, and found that there were a couple of our other friends over there as well. I don't remember much from being over there, except that I occasionally would forget that I was at his apartment, and that I was actually at my apartment instead (The layouts of our apartments are nearly identical).. I almost walked into his roommate's room a couple times, thinking that it was actually MY room (they are in the same relative location). Later on that night, my wife would inform me that I smoked some cannabis while I was over there and wrapped myself up in a blanket, but I do not have any recollection of these events.. I was sure that I had taken off my clothes while I was over there, too, but my wife assures me I did not. I was also informed, later on, that there were two people over there smoking Salvia earlier that night, and now I wonder if that could possibly account for some of the disassociative quality of my trip.", "We returned home, and I was still unsure as to the 'who, what, when, where, why, and how' of the situation. My wife asked me some questions, but I wasn't entirely sure what she was saying, and kind of just went 'uhhhhh... uh huh..' and nodded my head. It was then that I remembered that I had written some things in my notebook, so I grabbed it, hoping that it would help jog my memory. I found that I was unable to read, and was becoming more and more certain that I was clinically braindead. I did not remember taking the mushrooms, and thought that I felt the way I did because I had recently quit smoking tobacco.", "I slowly phased back into 'normal' reality, but I would not be completely rematerialized until I woke up from a good nights sleep. I feel that I missed an important part of the trip (the 'reconstruction' phase), and next time I would like to have another person around to help keep me from getting too lost. When I went into the trip initially, I had a very focused mind, I was certain of that- but by the end I felt that my consciousness had been sent through an atomic coffee grinder. Confusion reigned, and I was unable to hold my pieces together. I can only imagine what it must have been like for my friends to see me in that state of mind, since I do not really remember anything I said to them..", "If I had to summarize this trip into two words, they would be 'confusion' and 'strange'. But, despite the harsh descriptions I have provided, it was not a trip that I would group into the 'bad' category. I feel that even though I was unsure as to who I was or what the hell was happening to me for a good chunk of the trip, I learned a lot from this experience and would jump at the opportunity to try it again, albeit I probably need a month or two for the lessons learned to completely sink in.", "Well, you would imagine my excitement when a friend of mine comes over with an ounce of dried mushrooms. I had eaten shrooms twice before and found that I liked the trip. I didn't have any cash on me, so he said he would set aside 1/8 ounce for me. He left to go hawk his fungus.", "A few days later, my friend found me and fronted me the mushrooms, as I still had no money. I had grown (with limited results) mushrooms before and was very familiar with what they looked like. But these mushrooms were kind of odd looking. Something just didn't look right about them. I like to be safe with things like this, so I decided to wait and hear what other people thought about them.", "And then I heard their stories. Actually, the first place I heard it was from my brother, who actually told me that I shouldn't eat them. It turns out that everyone who ate them (these were people who had eaten shrooms many times previously) got very nauseous and vomited violently for about 3 hours. One person shat their pants. And another kept hearing a very malevolent voice repeating the phrase 'death before dawn'. He looked outside, and seeing that the sun was about to come up, ran outside and drove to the hospital. He then had his stomach pumped.", "Everyone who ate them recommended that I not eat them. So I didn't, and I gave them back to my friend. Thankfully, he understood. No one was really angry with him, but they did use it to antagonize him for a while.", "I think someone probably saw some clusters of mushrooms growing somewhere and misidentified them.  I am certainly a better person from having taken hallucinogens, but things like this are some of the sources of the populus's aversion to them.  It pays to be cautious.", "(no contact information avaialable, used without permission) ", "The nitty gritty details of the Shroom tryout.

He gets them exactly 12 months from the time they end the previous year and they last three months. So if he got them this year in Jan. they would normally end in April then the following year begin in April go until July and then begin the following year in July. This has been the pattern all along without exception until he was put on Sibellium (a preventative) which put him into remission for approx. 32 months. When he came off of it they began again within 14 days. He didn't want to keep taking it because of the side effects of which neither of us can remember anymore, that was the spring of 92. The CH's then went back to the same pattern.  ", "The frequency of the CH's were as follows. The first two weeks usually were 2 -3 a day but still able to sleep in bed for the night. Followed by a rapid increase to 5-10 which would also be during the night. He could no longer, once into the third week, sleep laying down, or for anymore than an hour at a time. Just prior to taking the treatment he was getting them so close together that at times they seemed like one long one with the ebbing only lasting 5-10 minutes until he was back into a Kip10++ which would include vomiting. (Which he does when the pain becomes too intense) The day before the treatment he had a CH that seemingly lasted 9 1/2 hours. No meds taken.  ", "We were given approx. 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried stems/no caps. We diluted it quite a bit mixed with four cups of water, put into boiling water and simmered for 15 minutes. He had a bad one coming on and he drank half of it 1 1/2 cups. He was in full swing and sitting rocking back and fourth crying and moaning for about 10 minutes.  ", "He complained about being cold, very cold, rocking with his head clenched in his hands from a sitting up position to his head on his knees and up again, moaning, 'oh God, oh God' then he came up and said 'oh MY GOD!' It was gone, between being in an upright position and rocking forward to his knees it disappeared! He was rubbing his head and smiling and wiping tears away, and saying 'I can't believe I was just suffering so much! It's gone, completely, it's gone!' Big smiles, lots of hugs and kisses, much celebrating and then the giggles set in! :) Many many giggles and then a few hallucinations when he closed his eyes he saw houses with different colored lights on them and didn't like that until I told him to enjoy the show. He was fine then. We went to bed and slept soundly for about 6 hours. He then woke up with another whopper. I gave him the remaining 1 1/2 cups after five minutes BANG gone. Cold first then it goes. This time not completely he still had the shadow (heavy shadow he said)There were distinct changes in the headache itself. The stabbing pain in behind his eye was not as severe, somehow masked more so that if felt like it was not being shoved out of your head and not as intense. What he usually used was ice on his head and back of his neck, but this made it worse now, heat helped, he warmed his hands on a heated bean bag and then held them to his face. Physically of what I couldsee, there were also marked differences in that his eye did not water as much, his nose was not running, and the eye did not bulge or get blood shot. The other difference was that his eye did not droop.  ", "We had no more left so before we went back to bed I poured more boiling water over the remnants and left it on the stove (no heat) while we slept. Two hours later he was up again. Keep in mind now how diluted this mixture has now become. Again I gave him a cup (3/4 full was all there was) and he drank it back. Again within five minutes it was gone. That was approx. 6:00am and he decided not to risk bed again. He was CH free for five days, but still had the shadow, not as bad.  ", "72 hours after treatment. He had three CH's very short about 5-30min. each. Only reaching Kip 7 at most. He slept in bed from 10:00pm until 4:00am when he woke with one that went upto a Kip7 only 10min. Went back to bed and slept until 8:30am and woke with one about Kip7 30min. duration. He then was shadowing at a Kip 3.  ", "Only got less than a teaspoon. About a third of what the first batch was. We had read Flash's post which said not take another dose for five days after the first so we waited that long. During a bad one about a 9 ~ I gave him the tea. Nothing. We waited and waited and it just got worse and worse. Finally after about 5 1/2 hours it ebbed and he went back to bed for a few hours. He was still shadowing and aching all over. After the 48 hours he began to get better and better. Still shadowing but only slightly and no headaches for 19 hours.

And up until this point, I liked Phish to some degree. After this night, however, my perception of them changed and I haven't liked them since.", "Anywho...I was given the shrooms at the end of the first night's show and was going to wait until the second night's show which I did. Waiting calmly right in front of the entrance to where they'd take my ticket, my friends where taking an awfully long time to arrive where I told them I'd be. I grew anxious so I called them on my cell phone. One of my friends informed me that they had already ingested their share of the psilo and told me that I should take my share and that they'd meet me, where I was, in a matter of minutes. I waited for 30 minutes for them to rear their ugly heads growing more nervous, by the minute, that I was about to plunge into my trip alone with roughly 50,000 people surrounding me. Just as it was about to hit me, my friends came as I wiped the sweat from my brow.", "We all went inside. When the show started, I was enjoying the music a great deal moving my head around and bopping to the music. After about 15 mintutes, my ceased completely, I crossed my arms, and the music became almost non-existant. I started to pose un-ending questions to myself on why I was there? had I urinated myself yet? what the hell time was it?(I was checking the time every 2 minutes) and I couldn't tell the temperature for the life of me. I WAS MORE PERPLEXED THEN I HAD EVER BEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I started to imagine how great it would be to begin my new band with members of the military guarding all posts at a music club that we would play at. And all of our shows would be the meeting grounds for business types with their double breasted suits and cell phones, but they wouldn't come for the music...they were only there to meet collegues and associates. I kept looking at the projection screen with Trey Anastasio's(the lead singer for Phish) big jolly face on it and thought to myself: How in God's name did this band gather such a following? ", "Everything that I said I did or thought in the above paragraph repeated themeselves about 2 more times: my curiosity about the temperature, what time it was, and if I had pissed myself or not. By this point five minutes had passed. I grew frustrated and blamed Phish for the short time lapse for which I thought had been a good hour I was thinking to myself. ", "Meanwhile, my friends were looking at me, and to ensure that I was okay they asked me what I was thinking. It was at that point that I shouted the words, that could've gotten me castrated at any other show, 'I FUCKING HATE PHISH!!!' My friends looked at me as I looked at the people around me and continued, 'I HATE THESE FUCKING PEOPLE!!!' Everyone within a 4 yard radius stopped dancing to look at me. My friends thought that it was a good decision to re-locate ourselves shortly after my little outbreak.", "The rest of the night went relatively smoothly. Final summation:", "This was probably one of the worst days of my life.  Me and my friend scored some shrooms, and we were going to do them for the first time. But the night we were going to do them, my girlfriend (now ex) told me not to take them so I didn't. So the next morning I decided to take them. I wrapped all of them up in some bread and proceeded to munch on them. Everyone told me a quarter was way too much, but what the hell, I wanted to trip.  I was the only one tripping too, and I was told not to do that either, but again I disobeyed.  ", "After about half an hour, I started to se some tracers. I thought it was cool but I was unaware of the following horrors.  All five of us were sitting around watching TV when I started to feel myself turn into liquid. I didn't notice it for awhile, but then I melted down onto the floor and my friends all started to laugh at me. I started yelling for them to pick me up, and they did and put me back onto the couch. I was back to normal form and my trip stopped for a second. Then I looked at my friend Jake, and he had black lines all over his face and I started screaming. They all told me to shut up because they were watching TV. ", "I felt so alone being the only one tripping, and secretly I started to cry. Then Jake saw that I was crying and started to make fun of me. I cried harder. I ran to the bathroom because my nose started running, not the normal cold running, I mean gushing mucous. I soon had a booger about 3 feet long. It was disgusting. So I washed myself up and my friends told me to take a shower. Big mistake. I got in and the water seemed to absorb into my skin. I could hear every bead as it hit my skull and then it stopped suddenly. After about 2 minutes, I could hear a voice in my head. It was my friend. He started saying how much of a loser I was, and how I am worthless. I cried some more and then decided to get out, the voice was making me depressed. ", "So as I stepped out, I looked to the corner of my bathroom and I saw a little green man. You could call him a leprechaun. I was scared shitless. He started hissing at me and then he froze. Then the shadows that his eyebrows cast on his face suddenly took over his body in a deep blackness and it sunk into the wall. I cried some more. I came out of the bathroom stark naked and crying, and my friends took me downstairs to my room and told me to get dressed. I stood in the middle of the room crying for about a half hour. Then I finally got myself together and put some underwear on. When I reached out for a knob on my closet drawer, I saw my hand melt into the drawer. Again, I cried at the loss of my right hand. ", "I laid on my bed and cried very hard until all my friends came down and calmed me down. They took me back upstairs and I looked into the bathroom mirror and the tiny hairs on my face grew very long and took over my head. More crying. This is about 4 hours after I ate the shrooms (the shower was roughly about an hour long, I cut it down because not much happened). I then decided I should sleep. That was the only good thing that happened. My dream was total darkness and I felt as though I was flying through space, seeing stars and planets, and then quickly falling towards the earth, then when I hit, I awoke. I laid there on my bed for a good 2 hours thinking about the earth and how my life is meaningless and I cried some more, I mean very hard crying, you can't even imagine. After the hour cry I began to come down very quickly and my life was back to normal. I was very happy it was over, and I was hesitant to do it the next time. Maybe I'll write about that one sometime.", "It was about 6pm on a Saturday night, I was with a few friends on our way to go pick up some weed.  The person in the car who was hooking us up informed us that there might be a chance to get some 'shrooms.  I had only done 'shrooms on two other occasions, and both those times not much happened.  We all chipped in some money and told him to go for the 'shrooms if they were availible, and if not, just go for weed.  After about 20 minutes, he returns to the car and tells us the good news, he got the 'shrooms!", "We decided to go back to my friend's place because his parents were out for the night and because he had a game system we could trip out on.  So we get back to his place, divide up the mushrooms onto some chocolate ice cream, and dig in.  We then played some games and watched some tv for about 45 minutes to an hour.  No one felt the 'shrooms coming on yet, so we went out to smoke some weed just to get things going.  After a medium sized joint and a full bowl, we went back inside to play some more games.  I grabbed a coke, went downstairs and sat down on the couch.  It was just shortly after that I felt the 'shrooms kick in.  There was about a minute of the 'things are different' feeling and then everything started to go wrong.  I felt like I had to get up, but my vision was starting to go dark.  I got up off the couch, feeling very strange.  I tried to make it to the stairs but I hit the ground about halfway up.  I woke up with everyone in the room standing above me, yelling my name.  My nose was bleeding and I had no idea where I was.  They helped me sit up against a wall while I tried to stop my nosebleed.  I still had no idea where I was, and I was wondering why everyone was still looking at me.  I told them I was alright, and that I just needed to sit down for a bit.  They were all freaking out because they thought I was going to black out again, I was pretty pale and I couldn't really move yet.  I had to ask for some blankets because I was really cold at this point.", "I was more or less alright after we watched tv for another hour or so.  I had regained most of my color and was able to move.  I could feel the mushrooms working now, but I wasn't in any kind of mood to take advantage of the trip.  Since I could move now, we thought it would be best to drop me off at home, so I could just take it easy.  I sat in my bed tripping out for about 3 hours before I was able to fall asleep.  It wasn't a good trip, but it wasn't really bad either.", "Out of the 4 of us who ate 'shrooms, one guy didn't feel anything, another guy had a really mild trip, and the other person (who ate about twice as much as any of us) had a decent trip.  I can't say whether or not I'll try them again. I do really believe mushrooms are a great way open up your mind, but maybe I'm just not meant for them =P", "Recently, I got notice from a friend that there were shrooms available that night.  I had been meaning to try them, having tried acid, DXM, ecstasy, and marijuana.  My friend went to pick them up and we each had one sixteenth of an ounce at about 1:00am.  Afterwards, however, we got in a huge argument and my friend walked to a party leaving me to trip by myself.  Thus, my trip started off on the wrong foot and I was in a terrible mood when I began to feel the effects.  Eventually, I believe that this caused the peak of the trip to be more confusing and frustrating.  ", "The body buzz began setting in approximately 20 minutes after I ate the shrooms which, by the way, tasted nasty.  This buzz intensified for about another 45 minutes until it had become by far the most intense body buzz I had ever felt from any drug.  At this point, I was sitting with a friend in his room.  As I got more and more fucked, communication became harder and harder.  At the same time, other people came into my friend's room and everyone had a conversation which I was unable to comprehend let alone participate in.  This didn't stop me from trying.  Thus, for about two hours I wondered from room to room talking jibberish to my friends.  They were, of course, understanding but the experience was very confusing and frustrating for me as I realized that I was making no sense.  Even I was surprised by some of the random things that came out of my mouth.  Nonetheless, I couldn't stop talking.  ", "Meanwhile, I had begun to hallucinate for the first time on any drug.  While I can't qualify what these hallucinations were, my room was amazing.  It was decked out in psychedelic lights and pictures and everything was jumping out at me.  The walls moved and the world was tinted in different colors.  This was exciting, needless to say, and if I had relaxed by myself in my room, I'm sure the experience would've been much more enjoyable.  Finally, as I began to come down at around 4 am, I redeveloped my communication skills and talked for hours with my friends.  Aside from while I was on ecstasy, this was probably one of the most enjoyable conversations I had ever had.  However, in the last stages of coming down, I was very tired yet I knew I was unable to sleep yet.  Additionally, my stomach and throat felt wierd and I had a headache.  The same thing had happened to me on acid so I didn't sweat it.  Finally, at 9am, I was able to fall asleep for a few hours before I got up at noon for class.  Although this experience had ups and downs, I'm glad that I took the shrooms, and I learned a lot about how to take psychadelic drugs.  First of all, I learned tripping alone is not a good idea.  It's important, especially the first time on any drug, to take it with someone and to have someone sober to look after you.  I had plenty of friends with me to make sure I did nothing stupid, however, the experience would have been much more enjoyable had someone else been feeling what I was feeling.  Secondly, its always best to be in the right frame of mind prior to your trip.  I feel that this decreases the chances of having a bad time.  All in all, I am definately planning on shrooming again, although hopefully in a better setting and under better circumstances.", "Here is my journal pages from the first time I ever tripped. It's a bit tough to follow but here goes. It's not too long I hope you enjoy my first trip. It was really intense but the writing I did that night was not just random thoughts.", "(That is all I wrote....the night was long and fantastic. I could probably tell you more now about what happened but that is what I wrote. The whole trip was in a car ride for hours. We drove miles and it seemed like minutes. Tell me what you think)", "9:45 I just ate 3 pieces of mushrooms 2 stems and a cap. It's 9:45pm on Friday.

Having previously done fairly large quantities of LSD, I thought I would be well-prepared for new psychedelics. At around 10:30 we ingested about 2 grams each of powdered cubensis mushrooms, followed by an additional gram each about half an hour later. Eating the mushrooms was somewhat unpleasant, and shortly after the second dose my husband vomited. I was just beginning to feel the effects at that point and was overcome with sympathy for him. Vomiting on psychedelics is colorful but not exactly fun. I experienced mild nausea from 10:30 to about 11:30, but laying down seemed to alleviate it somewhat. I reclined on the floor and began watching the carpet shift and form moving patterns. The trip started a lot more quickly than I had expected, and I had a momentary fear that I had taken too large a dose. The lights became an annoyance, and we turned most of them off.", "One of the first things I noticed (aside from the crawling carpet) was how tense I was, especially in my neck and back. I then began to realize how anxious and tense I had been for some time. Almost immediately I began to hear another voice in my head...I wondered why my body felt so shitty, and the voice explained a number of factors in my life that had contributed to that. I felt sleepy, dreamy, and I succumbed to the urge to close my eyes. I began to enter a trance state. At first I hallucinated glowing 3-D molecules, strings of neon light and layers of iridescent, netlike fabric- but these soon gave way to heavier shit.", "I started receiving what I can best describe as genetic memory of the mushroom- its long history with humans, and I gained some insight into the shamanic possibilities it possessed. I was shown a number of paths I could follow, from reliving someone else's mushroom trip to experiencing death to performing acts of magic. It reminded me of the final scenes in Hesse's Steppenwolf.", "The voice was joined by other voices, which I thought to be earth elementals or vegetation spirits. All of the voices were friendly, helpful, and they helped me decide on a path for the trip- it was to be a metaprogramming sort of thing. A friend of ours spoke and I slowly came out of the trance and sat up.", "The hallucinations did not intensify in the same way that LSD does as you begin to peak, and the side effects were much less severe. I felt relaxed, comfortable, and mellow. I sensed that the mushroom was alive and with me, but I felt detached from the world and everything but my consciousness. Everything seemed unreal and unimportant. It was at about this point that our friend suggested we try some Nitrous.", "My husband did the first balloon. He sat with his eyes closed, smiling, for about 30 seconds, and came out of it laughing. He tried to explain what it had done to him but words seemed inadequate. He then joined our friend in trying to convince me to try it, but I didn't want to. A voice explained to me, 'That's not what this trip is about.' My husband did two more balloons, and seemed, for lack of better words, blown away by them.", "I began to slip back into a trance, and the serious work of my trip was begun in silence. Our friend put on some music, and I occasionally drifted out of the trance to ponder the strangeness of the lyrics. My consciousness was shown to me as a 3-dimensional board game with amazing multicolored passageways and columns. Together with the other entities, I began to play the game of Me. I started examining my interpersonal relationships and saw some large mistakes I had been making- the voices showed me, in a kindly way, that I had been selfish, neurotic, and guilty of perpetuating bad karma. My bitterness, resentment and anger were shown to me as a parasite I needed to let go of, and I did. I was overwhelmed with inner peace and joy. My ego slowly faded away and I felt like I was part of the Vibration of the All. ", "As the peak ended, I started reconstructing my personality, and I was shown further work that needed to be done. Our friend went home, and my husband and I discussed what we had experienced as best we could. We smoked some marijuana, and the trip came to an end. I decided that the trip, although scary at times, was definitely a highly positive experience, and I felt a strong urge to thoroughly explore the strange world of psilocybin.", "I had acquired a quarter of very blue-looking shrooms and decided that me and my friends, who are roomates, were going to trip.  We tripped the night after I was done with classes and just starting spring break.  I was kind of unsure on how to take the shrooms, I didn't just want to eat them plain, because there was some shake in the bag.  ", "We divided the bag up exactly four ways, although I took the larger pieces of caps.  We each made peanut butter and shroom sandwiches, with lots of cold lipton iced tea.  Immediately after finishing the sandwiches, I rolled a joint of some very high quality commercial pot.  ", "About an hour later, my stomach was feeling a little sick, but the joint seemed to help curb it.  I felt tremendously stoned.  I think I was the first to start tripping, as I had purposefully not eaten all day.  For the first time in an hour, I stood up and went to refill my Iced tea.  Being a pretty big guy (5'10, 220 lbs,) I was amazed at how light and uncumbursome my body felt.  ", "The shrooms really started to kick in, and we were all lying on the floor of the apartment.  We decided to put a blacklight in the kitchen, which has black and white checkedred floor.  The combination was really interesting, I remembered. All of us are musicians, and the violin player put on a CD of solo violin music that never sounded so beautiful.  My sister played violin and it was sad to hear the beautiful music.  Later we listened to Shostakovich 5 and it was absolutely redeeming.  The chords seemed so full of energy and I really remeber just melting to the harmonies.  I was lying on the couch at this point, and it really felt good to hold the cushions tight against me.  I started to think of my old girlfriend, and it made me sad to think that she wasn't a part of my life anymore.  ", "Then the visuals kicked in.  I was content closing my eyes and watching the movies that my mind (and the shrooms) were displaying for me.  Opening my eyes revealed a world more unrealistic than the world my closed eyes showed me.  I saw very round images of red blue and green hued objects.  I felt very, very comfortable with everything.  Then I opened my eyes and noticed that everything was pretty weird.  My cigarettes were burning very quickly and prefectly, and smkoing seemed great and very serene.  I vividly remeber moving my fingers rapidly and not believing that they were leaving trails.  A lit cigarette in a dark room became a chasing ball when I circled it around.  I felt like in the backround, I could hear pouring rain, although it was a clear night out completely.  I started to freak out that a substance could do this to me.  My vision turned Matrix-style 3-D, and things were very mathematically correct for awhile.  ", "My friends all kind of went to their rooms and lay in bed and I walked home.  I was unnaturally hot and sweaty, it must have been 30 degrees outside.  I had only a fleece pullover on, and it seemed ridiculously hot.  I would have given my kingdom for a ride home, which was only a block away.  Cars scared me and I was a bit paranoid of passing out on the way home.  I felt like curling up and just laying in the street.  What an expreience!  I stayed up for four hours, hoping to get back to reality.  The littlest sounds freaked me out and the odd visuals continued to disturb me.  I was afraid to open my eyes, for I thought I was be so scared.  Going to the bathroom alone was a frightening journey.  I'm not sure if I will do shrooms again, but when I do, I will do it on a much warmer day, and also have people who arent shrooming around to watch us.", "I have regarded Erowid as a very substantial and respectable source of knowledge regarding mind exploration, whether chemically or internally induced.  I have spent literally hours delving into the fascinating, humorous, and sometimes frightening and awful experiences of those who have sought to look beyond the perceptions of sobriety.  I myself have spent several years using psychoactive substances as a means to explore the depths of human consciousness and to better understand the world around me.  I've had a tremendous amount of fun along the way, I might add(let's not be too serious!).", "My most recent(just came down about 1.5 hours ago) experience was with a small amount of mushrooms that I have been anxiously cultivating for six weeks.  This 'experience' was more on the order of a scientific determination of these mushrooms' potency and quality of effect.  I was neither planning or hoping to be blasted.  ", "I took two small, young fresh 'shrooms(3.4gms) with a teaspoon of brown sugar and chewed on the (delicious) molasses for about a minute before swallowing.  I don't at all mind the taste of fresh mushrooms, but the natural sweetness of the brown sugar made them far more enjoyable, I highly recommend this method of consumption.  I kept a simple journal of the trip which I won't bore you with. Within twenty minutes of consumption, I began to notice physical tension in my muscles and the weird skin irritability that characterizes my mushroom 'come-ons.'  For the next two hours, I had a relatively mild mushroom trip.  That is, relative to my considerable psychedlic experiences and relative to the fact that I consumed a very small dosage(Yea! My shrooms are rockin').  So what's so special about all this?", "Why am I up at 1am writing about a rather uneventful night of watching football and undulating visual patterns in my shower curtain?  I see so many things written in this great database of knowledge regarding the vast, unexplainable worlds of high dosage drug induced psychosis.  I am no stranger to these worlds.  My most recent dabblings with DXM and salvia were intense, amazing, and quite unintelligible.  However, I just had a very positive and productive time balancing the necessities of my reality(school, work, relationships, blah, blah, blah) and the deep thought provoking fun of a mushroom trip.  I have come down relaxed and happy.  My personality has not changed and I do not have a new outlook on life, but I have made some decisions about what I should be doing tommorow and next week that I otherwise would never had considered or latched onto.  Yes, I think many of us here who take mind-altering substances do so to step away from the mundanity, frustration, and disillusionment of everyday life.  But also because the result of these actions are personally beneficial and enjoyable.  This most recent experience has taught me that a good 'trip' does not require taking the experience to catalytic levels.  I would hate for Erowid's vault of trip reports to be a 'how to  get the most fucked up' list.  I am not saying that everyone should take less drugs.  God, no!  I just hope that this little late night thought gets posted so that the people who look to these things for insight, pleasure, and refreshment can see that their goals can be attained without subjecting themselves to fear, doubt, awful come-downs and hangovers.  Not everyone wants to meet God on a Sunday night.  I have never been very big on mushrooms because of their low urban availability.  However, I am now thouroughly pleased with the fruits of my labor, and have, at once, become quite a mushroom fan.  Ultimately, I do concede that 'to each his own,' but the conclusions on this little test have come back very positive, and I believe that others may find a good light in it too.", "Trip suggestions:  Mushrooms are weird because you never know how good they are.  If you have a trusted source, great!  If you are getting these things from a cow pasture somewhere or some shady guy with a twitch in his left eye, careful experimentation is best.  Everyone's version of a mild trip is different, so find your comfort zone.  I, personally, could have taken a little more this evening.  Because mild mushroom trips don't overwhelm you with confusion and powerful visuals, relaxation is required to induce the subtle beauty of the trip.  Playing your favorite music is number one! (To anyone who likes chill electronic music, check out Cafe del Mar series, especially Vol. 7.)  Anyway, all other basic tripping rules apply, but I think mild mushroom trips are great for solo work.  I definitely plan to experiment more with this wonderful companion to introspection and repose.  ", "Peace, and I hope you find what you're looking for.", "My first experience with mushrooms was a very pleasant one and I am blessed to have been able to experience mushrooms with my best friend, Mason. Mason and I met during our freshman year of high school and today, we are 21, we still partake in our summer ritual.", "We're from the midwest. While we've taken mushrooms during the cold months, it doesn't compare to the beautiful, warm summer months. Since our first experiences with mushrooms, we usually gather at friends' houses or rent a nice cabin in the woods for the weekend. But our first experience was drastically different.", "Mason and I had cut our last class of school on a Friday. We were driving around, trying to find something to do. On a whim, Mason suggested that we stop past the apartment of a friend's. She was older than Mason and I, but she had known him for years and she was the singer in their band.", "Luckily, she was there, preparing for her roomates' birthday party. We helped decorate and we stopped past my house to drop of our books and get something to eat. We got back to her apartment around 6 pm. People began to gather in the apartment. When a friend of ours, who I'll call Jim arrived, he immediately asked Mason and I if we wanted to do some shrooms? He recently got back from mushroom hunting with his friend and said that they were extremely good; him and his friend had tried some the day earlier.", "Mason and I looked at one another and stalled. Up to then my only experiences with drugs was with alcohol, marijuana and hash. Our parents were really laid back and allowed us to smoke and go to weekend festivals if we'd stayed out of trouble and did well in school; and we were both on the honor roll. But that was the extent of my drug knowledge. To be honest, I was scared, but intrested. And being with Mason put my mind at ease.", "We said yes. Jim began talking about how to take them like putting them in tea, or just eating them whole. I like tea, so I decided to do it that way. Mason roughed it and swallowed them whole. I prepared a pot of hot water and put the mushrooms in the tea, but there wasn't any honey or sweetner, so I eventually swallowed them along with Mason. Mason and I hugged one another and went to join the rest of the party.", "We sat down on a couch and talked with the guests. I didn't know what to expect. Since I didn't feel anything for the first few minutes I stopped thinking about it. After about 30 minutes though, I began to feel something. I couldn't determine just how I felt, but I didn't feel bad. It was a warm, ticklish feeling that slowly spread throughout my body. Mason and I became more animated, and were laughing about the most obvious of things. Actually, it felt almost similar to being high for the very first time. But, the movement around the apartment got to be too much. People who we didn't know were coming in and out. Loud, aggresive music was playing, and people were laying into a keg. It felt like we were stuck and couldn't breathe. We slowly made our way to the outside balcony, and promptly shut ourselves off from the clamor.", "We sat back on the balcony. The sun had set and the beautiful midwest sky began to turn from orange-purple to blue. Blue is my favorite color and the colors of the sky began to change to the different shades of blue. First a light sky blue, then to cerulean, to electric blue...The colors became more and more saturated in tone like I was adjusting the cyan dial on my photo enlarger at home. It felt as if the sky were breathing. I was giddy; that's the only way to describe it. I began fumbling with my plactic bracelet. It was filled with liquid glitter. I must have been ripping at it because all of a sudden the bracelet broke open, and the watery glitter poured onto the balcony deck. The glitter splashed on my hand and felt so cold. Mason was loking at me with amusement. He was like, 'what the fuck did you just do?' I began to run my fingers into the puddle of glitter, which started to look like light reflecting off a pool of water. All of a sudden, Mason bolted, hugged me quickly and told me he'd be right back. He had to leave. He went back into the apartment and walked out the door. ", "I sat back and continued to enjoy the light show above. By now the stars were out and it was completely cloud-free. AND it was a full moon. I never wear a watch but it must have been sometime around 10 or 11. I don't know how long I was sitting there, but I finally went inside. ", "I sat on a papasan chair and randomly thought out loud, 'Where's Mason?' Jim said Mason was still outside. Jim and I finally got control of the CD player and popped in some Tranquility Base, Phish, BT, Blind Melon and Grateful Dead (What a combo!)", "Somehow, I could feel Mason walking up the stairs back to the apartment. I got up and walked to the door just as he came through and looked directly at me. 'Let's go,' he said. Jim and I made our exit and the three of us got into Jim's car. We began to drive. ", "Mason and I sat in the back. Mason apologized for leaving, but he said he needed to get up and move. He said he was walking around the field outside of the apartment. He was walking down a path, not quite sure of what he was looking for and he told me, dead serious, that he saw his own reflection looking back at him.", "Jim continued driving. We drove out of the city, that I do know. We ended up in some small town I'd never been in. We stopped in a small coffee shop where Jim said he knew the owner. It was halfway crowded. Some crappy music was playing in the background. There was a stage, complete with drums, lights and microphone. Mason asked the owner if he could play up there. She said sure and handed him a guitar. He sat onstage and began to tune the guitar, then he began to play a song he and his band had been practicing for some time. He motioned for me to come on stage. He was like, 'sing, you know the words,' By that time, I was completely oblivious to whatever else was going on. I began to sing, eyes shut. When I opened them and crowd had gathered in front and began to applaud. Jim must have called the people back at the party and told them to come over, because after awhile, half the people from the party were up there, listening. The real singer of their group came up and we sang a song together, then I sat back and played the bongos. We made over $50 in tips that night. The owner wanted me to come back and sing with Mason!", "When the crowd from the apartment started to get loud, Mason, Jim and I split yet again. While we were driving back home it felt as if we were in a scene from 'Back to the Future' It was like a complete timewarp. It felt like the car was moving at rapid speed, even though after repeatedly checking the speedometer, we were going the speed limit.", "When we got back into town, we were both close to the comedown. But still, the colors to me were ultra vivid. Jim dropped us over at Mason's house. We crawled into his large water bed and floated off to sleep...", "Time: Around seven pm till 2 am on 20th of May 1995.", "Occasion: Smoking of several grams (4-6 g) of skunk-weed and ingestion of 8 large Psilocybe semilanceatas for recreational purposes.", "Setting: This experience took place in my apartment in comfy bed while different very enjoyable ambient was beingplayed. A friend was present also enjoying little relaxatory doses of these substances.", "Mind Set: I had not ingested any psychedelic substance since 4.11.95 (about 5 months pause). Have felt good for last weeks, and during previous week studied ethnobotany and anthropology quite intensively. During saturday first slept till 2 pm, and then went to a festival (alone though - was unable to reach any friends, which caused a very slight depression); 'Worlds Meet' - all kinds of people there and lots of different musics/arts/thoughts etc. Nice atmosphere.", "After that went to Botanical Gardens of Helsinki University for a long stroll. Very nice, and I felt very peaceful and calm after leaving the gardens. Went home and a friend came at 6 when he said he'd come. We started with a chat and a few small bonghits...", "These skunk bonghits were always very subtle but powerful, I felt. One thinks one is very sober and normal, but when trying to do something or even thinking something complex reveals the true nature of things.. Fun, I've always felt.", "We smoked couple of small bongfuls of these (maybe 2 grams per head), and then decided to take a little time to listen to FSOL's ISDN and Isaku Sakaros Ohm.. Nice.. Both very nice for this ultralight-paragliding of the conciousness. Both are of very high fidelity with large hall and space-echoes even when sober, and my stereos are also very HiFi, so almost immediately I was swept along into the spaces and places in the music - every detail and overall perception of music was of very hig resolution. I was on the verge of literally tripping - nice visuals.", "After about half an hour we drank some mushroom tea. Taste was as icky as it had been 5+ months ago and before that, and all effects felt somehow very familiar. Though quite diluted, in spite of the very long pause. While stoned, the tenseness of the jaws was not felt coming on, and legs felt quite feeble already, so only coming on-effects were introduction of extra reverb into each sound, and very slow deepening of all thoughtpatterns... Visuals also came quite colorful, but the patterns I usually see on the retina (small dots, waves and squares of different color) were absent. Some Thursday Afternoon was being played, and we both decided that it w as bit too lame, as we both listen to it very much while reading and such.. So on came Terry Rileys Shri Camel.", "This was probably about 45 minutes after ingestion. I felt very sober, could speak very clearly and still knew I was quite inebriated. My friend put on Flasher to about 15 Hz and white, and I decided to take a dive to the deep...", "To some extent all this was spontaneous, and yet I did think every now and then parts of the hallucinations, for instance the tunnels... ... I thought, 'I'll go towards the light, white light,' and these beginnings of caverns were forming in front of my eyes, of blue, and pink and orange color.. I searched for the white light, and found it.. I dove in and the caven changed into tunnel made of turquose rings of light, I sped through them, towards the white light, rings grew quickly paler and suddenly I felt very weird - awed sort of, bit scared if I should do this, or jus t open my eyes - I had lost the feel of my body and was completely away in the spiritworld.. I hesitated for a microsecond and then continued while thinking 'Don't think. Think nothing. Thinki pinki.' [ =) ] - and suddenly was there -", "In the _Primordial_Fire_, it burned me away, cleansed me of everything, parts of me beginning to melt and turn into dust blow away by the horrible force of this pure white light - I opened my eyes, as I felt a tingles in my body where the parts had begun melting - everything was back to quite normal. 'Oh, don't fight it,' I thought, 'let go. Let go. LET GO,' I said to myself, and closed eyes, stopped fighting it, the fire returning in the form of a volcano, volcano the size of the Himalayas, I was the volcano. I burned and oozed and was being purified - and this was not an unpleasant feeling, more like bittersweet, and I also felt very powerful... I was unable to completely let go, so this little doubt dwelt in the back of my mind, whether I should stop, for the intensity of everything was rapidly escalating. ", "I the volcano turned from pale red to pure white, pressure building up along the temperature, and suddenly I let go. Just relaxed myself physically and mentally, and the volcano erupted into the skies, throught the skies to the space, towards all stars in the form of quark-sized million-kelvin particles. ", "My friend asked me whether I wanted to have a few hits off the bong.. I took some, and changed Riley to something else (can't remember). And then I lay down again, saying I'll take another dive. As I closed my eyes for a short time my thoughts and visions were very chaotic, but then I saw a woman. I don't know exactly what she looked like, and so on, but I stepped closer to her thinking I would began to have these visions of wild orgies I've sometimes had - in the Psychedelic Experience it is mentioned as some bardo of some level.. But no.", "She was Mother Earth. For a moment I was bewildered. Then I placed my hand on her vaginal lips, and first one, then two fingers slipped in.. Then my hand, and my arm.. And all the time I grew smaller, or she grew bigger, for I went inside her womb, which was a passageway.. I felt very warm.. very secure and she showed me things I had done wrong, things I should do... Very quickly after this the visions began to fade, totaling in about 3 hours.. My friend had taken a couple more shrms and he came out of it about half an hour later.. So we listened to weird and wonderful ambient-music and smoked and talked about what we had experienced... ", "What was very weird is that we smoked at least 3 grams of nice weed during these hours between 11 pm and 2 am, and either didn't feel very stoned. Maybe the rest of the bag was not as good as the top, or then our tolerance (psychological) had increased after the voyage.", "Summary (sort of): Very nice experience of much greater strength than I had expected, even after 5 months pause. However I was quite in control, being able to return to normal levels of conciousness by opening my eyes. The effects of the setting, I feel, were very pro- nounced (primordial fire, purification, symbolic death and mother earth are all elements of shamanic traditions). I liked very much the softening effects of the marijuana on the phase where ef- fects are coming on. But had I ingested larger dose (eg. 40 mushrooms), the result wouldn't probably had been as nice. Even though the preparation period was very short (couple of hours in the Botanical Gardens) experience was quite divine. So I arrive to this conclusion: The Divinity or Quality is not connected to the Dosage. More is not necessarily Better.", "So I've been a weekend hard drug-experimenter (not user -- too harsh) for about a year. Until then, the only illegal thing I'd done was smoked a lot of pot, but more recently I've tried acid, coke, tina, K, and ecstasy.  I'd always wanted to try mushrooms, but they're a scarce commodity around here, so I was ecstatic when a friend of mine just gave me 6 caps.  He warned me that they were pretty strong; he said he'd taken only one cap the night before and had been well fucked.  I decided to get myself in the mood and venture into the world of mushrooms with two of my friends.  We gathered at my apartment and lit a ton of candles and incense, put on some trance music, and smoked a few bowls.  Then we ate our mushrooms, each taking 2 caps apiece.  From the experience reports I'd read on Erowid, I expected them to taste like shit, but they weren't all that bad.  I just washed down the mushrooms with water, went back to smoking a joint we had going, and waited.", "Well, when they kicked in, I was REALLY glad that I'd read up on mushrooms.  I started to feel some weird body sensations: a freaky numb feeling through my whole body and then a churning motion in my stomach.  It didn't feel like nausea, more that there was something in there squirming to get out.  I briefly panicked, but then figured, 'Hey, it's cool, I've read about this' and concentrated on a candle on the table.  Suddenly, I looked at my friends, and their faces started to morph.  I thought I could see the veins under one of my friend's cheeks, and the other's nose seemed way too big for his face.  Suddenly, I thought it was all hysterical and started to laugh.  I spent the next hour cracking up over the stupid things I was seeing and the weird shit that was going through my head.  For example, one of my friends was sitting with his arms crossed, and I got this thought that he looked like a high priest.  Then I went back to staring at this candle on the table.  The light seemed to be shooting out the top and formed a figure that looked like a bare tree.  My other friend (not the high priest dude) was wearing a ton of rings, and whenever she moved her hands, she sent tiny specks of light into the room.  I was also really into the music, not as much as when I roll, but almost, and I kept having these spiritual thoughts, like that love is the answer to all things and that I shouldn't be as hard on myself as I am because my life will turn out fine.  These are things that I've kept in the back of my mind since that night.", "About 3 hours later, my friends had to leave, and I just sat in my living room (still smoking pot, of course -- hehe) staring out the window.  The silhouette of the trees were forming faces, and at one point, it looked like there was a huge green giant outside of my window that was reaching in to get me.  That scared me a little, but then I thought, oh well, I'm just fucked up.  I went to the bathroom to get ready for bed.  When I looked in the mirror, the person staring back at me seemed to be another person, and I thought that she was evil.  Luckily, I'd read reports about things like this, so I wasn't too worried.  I just went to bed and had no trouble getting to sleep.  I woke up the next day exhausted, but for the most part, I felt great.", "Anyway, I'd definitely recommend shrooms to anyone.  I got a lot of of this experience and haven't been the same since, for the better; I'm much more tolerant of people and relaxed about my life.  I think in moderation, drugs can improve your quality of life, but there are two things I'd tell someone who is getting into them: First, they're not something to do all the time, and second, know the effects that you should expect.  I've never freaked out on anything because I always read up on whatever I'm trying.  I'd discourage meth and coke use because it gets out of hand, but mushrooms are another story.  Be safe, do it for the right reasons, and they can change your life.", "Our sacrament today is mushrooms.

This was my first time and, so far, my only shroom experience.", "I did not experience anything unusual within the first hour or so, possibly even two hours. What I did notice (upon analyzing the events later on) was a slowly rising giddyness and an inability to hold a train of thought for very long. During the course of the walk from where my friend and I took them to my apartment I would forget a line of thought then it would bubble up maybe five, ten minutes later. The giddyness felt something like being drunk, only with hyper overtones.", "The whole night I did not experience any visuals beyond some meager trails. But the mental aspect was...illuminating. Over the course of the next few hours I was to go through a seemingly unrelated series of emotional states, such as extreme confidence, paranoia, bewilderment (did I mention paranoia? more on that later). I ran into the friend who had given me the shrooms that night, after I'd parted ways with my shroom partner. (Newbies: it is not recommended to separate from your partner(s) at any time during the experience).", "My provider expected me to be having vivid hallucinations and to be unable to separate hallucination from reality. Instead, my mind felt like it was in some kind of uncontrollable turbo mode. I found myself pacing around at one point. I think the calmest moments I had during the peak was, perhaps pathetically, while listening to Jimi Hendrix. You think that stuff is good when you're sober? It spoke to my soul in those moments. Then my provider distracted me and wanted me to see something cool. Another note: when somebody's trippin', just let them do whatever, as long as they're not endangering themselves or others, of course. It tends to disturb and already teetering emotional control and will make them extremely agitated.", "I could have sat there for hours, just drinking up Jimi's riffs, with a stupid smile wide enough to make my ears fall off. Well, he (my provider) had to go to sleep. It was late for him, so I moved on. During the walk from his location to mine, I got that classic feeling that people were looking at me. Not like they thought I was high, however. It was like I felt for the first time I saw, all around, people looking at me when they thought I didn't see them looking. Who knows what that was all about. It got to the point where I felt I was altering events just by my presence, like I was a mote, determining possibilities, and people whirled around me and did things they would not have done had I not been around.", "I went to see some friends for a few minutes, to see what was up. I felt uncomfortably aware of their personae. I felt as though I could divine their thoughts from their facial expressions during a discussion, in those moments when they were not talking or waiting to talk, merely watching the conversation themselves. Well, I felt really obvious and eventually ended up back at my apartment, alone. This is where the paranoia really took hold. In retrospect, I believe what I was doing was resisting the fading away of identity. Don't get me wrong; I still knew who I was, but only on an intellectual level. After about ten minutes of struggling here, I lay down and purposefully blocked out all thoughts. I replaced those thoughts with music I just created in my head (I did music in primary school and all of secondary school). It's not a hard thing to conjure music under those conditions. I just let Jimi take over for a while, turning up the mental volume whenever the heebie-jeebies got too close up. Then I expierenced something magical. I told myself to 'Just be.'", "For the next hour or so, as I drifted off to sleep, Jimi's extended jam faded away to be replaced by--silence. No thought. No emotions. Just calm. Relaxation. I let my mind drift naturally after a while, and I got some of the most unusual aural sensations I've ever experienced. Imagine your brain as being equipped with full-surround sound. I heard sounds I didn't expect or force. Rumbling and revving motorcycle engines scooting off from my left and into the distance. Snatches of conversation like a television turned up loud, then quiet.", "Gradually, these sounds seemed to fill in a picture that eerily matched the conditions outdoors. This was a late saturday night in a college town; people still walking around, milling, conversing. I saw those streets, as if I was walking into a dream. And with the escalating rapidity of water going down the drain, things became more vivid, more vivid, more vivid, then--pop! The sensations had become so real that I had got mentally jarred and came out of it.", "To this day I don't what to make of that event. I'd always had a hopeful curiousity about out-of-body experiences, perhaps this was merely some psychological manifestation of Freudian wish fulfillment. Or maybe it was actually my spirit floating around there. That would have been truly awesome, however unprovable, and I would take shrooms again in the hopes that I could recreate that experience.", "So, the brief version: giddyness evolving into a whirl of mental activity, no audiovisual hallucinations, some paranoia. Oh, and I had a little talk with myself, speaking alone to myself in the third person. That was unsettling. But no lasting side-effects. I felt fine the next morning.", "Oh, one more thing before I go to bed: I had a lot of grand notions about levels of being and existence; I envisioned interesting physical models to represent the levels, and where humans fit in. I was absolutely sure of our place in the midst of a multi-planar Universe full of all different kinds of sentient creatures both bodily and ethereal. That chiseled-in-stone conviction was nothing more than a bemusing notion the next day. My interpretation: don't let sudden 'revelations' about the Universe allow you to do things in public that you wouldn't usually do. I didn't do anything stupid, but I saw how easy it was to go flying off the handle, so to speak.", "I distinctly remember that, before actually ingesting the shrooms, my friend G said 'There's nothing like shrooms; they stand on their own'. After my first time... I can agree. ", "It was me and three friends. We all ingested the shrooms at about 6pm (right after I got home from work). S and G and I took the shrooms one at a time (there were about three, plus two stems) and chased them down with juice (they taste like crap). My other friend C, however, stuffed them into his mouth and swallowed. We glanced at him and he said 'Should I not have done that?' ... in retrospect, no he shouldn't have. I'm not going to say this experience was a bad trip... just one that made me realize just how intense my friends are and how intense my mind is. Cool.", "My first mistake was the pot. We smoked a lot of pot before the effects of the shrooms kicked in. This was bad for me, because my state of mind wasn't what I wanted it to be when I tripped. I'm very susceptable to the paranoia that pot causes. Under normal conditions, I remind myself that it's all in my head and I usually deal with it, no problem. On shrooms, however... that paranoia is elevated 100 fold. Very bad.", "My second mistake was tripping with C. He's my brother forever and I love him to death - but good lord... what a madman. He started tripping before all of us. I mean, he was in an absolute wonderland. The whole trip, he started talking in low voices and growling, saying things like:", "'You're in league with the bat people, aren't you?'", "'I'm trying to imagine how you must see me. I'm up above here, trying to see you.'", "Creepy stuff, coming from C. I started tripping about an hour after I took the stuff. Someone asked me if I was feeling the effects (there was music playing in the background) and I said 'no'. Immediately after I said that, the music in the background started playing backwards (and it was in french, so it was really trippy). Then a Frank Sinatra song came on and his voice started slowing down and speeding up - that was cool. I focused in on the shadows in my room and noticed them pulsating softly... now I'm definately in the groove. Then C and I both went mad...", "He started walking and screaming and shuffling and howling and talking jibberish. I started worrying about him, then I thought he was going to harm someone, then I thought that he was convinced I was his enemy. I went from different states of terror to sadness when I was around C. But then, everything was beautiful. The music, my surroundings. Things breathed and every intricate surface was important and interesting and divine. I remember walking to the Liquor Store and seeing an old couple crossing the street - but they weren't walking. Kind of hovering and jittering... talking at high speeds. It was funny - kind of reminded me of a Terry Gilliam Monty Python cartoon.", "G left early cause he had to go somewhere (he didn't trip with us...) and S didn't feel the effects till' 3am in the morning (when we were all trying to sleep). He started laughing and going on about how beautiful the moonlight was. He drew with a pen for hours on a piece of paper so I sat with him and talked to him about music and art and life. C passed out.", "When asked about my trip, I simply say 'it was a horrible, beautiful experience and I'd do it again at the drop of a hat. Though, that's a place I can't visit again for awhile, yet.'", "The thing about my friends, is that there's never any drama and if we have a beef about something, we talk to eachother about it, straight up. C and I had a casual conversation about how we were tripping off each other, and we ended up laughing in the end because the both of us were misinterperating each other's trip. Lack of communication - I suppose we were on different wavelengths which is ok.", "... and remember - ALWAYS remember: It's all in your head.", "I had done mushrooms on about 8 different occasions prior to this particular experience. We had just purchased about 2 ounces of mushrooms, and decided we'd eat them later the next night. Well, the next night I ended up buying some more and eating about 2 grams before we even broke into the 2 ounces. After about an hour after eating the first mushrooms I began to feel extremly light headed, and in a euphoric state. So I decided to take some knife hits of high grade cannibis, and to eat some more mushrooms.", "The colors at first, were facinating! I had never seen such tracers and patterns before, and was amazed by the bright and detailed color. They seemed so real! But, out of nowhere, the colors dissapeared, and I suddenly felt alone and confused. I could not figure out what was going on. I got scared, and decided I should go home and sleep it off.", "After finally finding a ride home, I started to feel a bit better. But as soon as I walked in the house I began to feel scared again. The patterns started to appear again. But now the patterns where consumed in everything I looked at. I was stuck in patterns. My thoughts slowly began to race, I was now unable to concentrate on any single thought. My heart began to race, I felt my soul was being ripped from my body. I thought I was dying, and tried lying down to relax my body, as my mind was telling me, I was preparing my soul for death. Not my body, but my soul. ", "I started to feel better, and felt as though I were slowly falling asleep, but all of a sudden I felt a jolt in my body. My ears began to ring. The most violent sound I have ever yet to hear. And in front of me appeared a solid gas sphere of bright colors, with extensions which grew from all sides of the sphere of colors. The sphere disapeared and my room began to sink in. It felt like my room was actually brathing, and I was stuck inside. Everthing I looked at began to shift shape and warp. I was now unable to concieve what was real and what was not. As things were warping, I felt this was the end, I thought I was going to have to kill myself to end it all. ", "As soon as the warping ended, I felt a urge to get up and leave the house. I jumped out of bed, sweating, and frantic, grabbed my shirt and began to put it on, only to throw it across the room. I don't know why I did, it kinda felt like the shirt was trying to grow onto me. I felt confused, began to put my pants on, but my hand braced up on some gum which mysteriously got stuck on me, I began to pull it off, unaware that it was gum, and thought I was pulling my skin off. I panicked. My body was deteriorating due to the poisons which I felt were slowly killing me. Once I realising it was just gum, reality began to slowly come back to me. I was begining to finally relize it was just a trip and would soon pass. Over the next 6 hours I experienced flashes off the mushrooms kicking in, but a little less powerful each time, until I finally fell alseep.", "For about the next 4-5 months, I experiend random flashbacks, and anxiety attacks. I have eat mushrooms since the experience, but I was alot more careful with my dosage. I have also done acid on different occainsions, but have had pleasruable experieneces every time.", "I feel like I made some confrotations with my fears. And feel like I actually got a positive experience out of this. And would one day like to take more, to experinece an even further journey of the mind.", "It was May 28, 1996.  The Grateful Dead were playing what would be their last Portland performance before Jerry's untimely, yet unsurprising demise. By happenstance, the concert fell directly on my 26th birthday.  My ticket was a gift from the friends who attended with me.  Along with this they were going to seek out suitable drugs to accompany the experience.  None of us were virgins to the psychedeilic experience; however I was not ready for the extra portion which I was afforded for being the birthday boy.  As is the tradition with dead show, we arrived several hours early to experience the carnival/ freak show environment that is omnipresent, and of course secure our party favors for the day.  The latter of which is prevelant and nearly unavoidable.  We soon settled with a bedraggled, dreadlocked and dirty deadhead on an undeterminable yet healthy looking bag of fungus.  We all quickly consumed our portions.  After a slow half hour of people watching, we made our way to a local bank machine to obtain some spending cash and prepare to enter the concert grounds... this is where things begin to go whacky.  I first felt a numb confusion. A wave of fear and anxiety which was a doozy of a first step.  I immediately was struck with the urge to make myself vomit. I struggled with this for about ten minutes, yet no matter how far I jammed my fingers in my throat, I was unable to dislodge the stuburn poison which was running rampant through my troubled body.  The only recourse I had was to try and 'ride the wave'.  My friends began to notice that I wasn't on their giddy train of light, mind alteration... quite the contrary, I was slipping over the edge, I was infact teetering, staring into the void, not sure or capable of deciding what to do.  Although slightly worried, they thought time would bring me right, and took my hand and led me back toward the show.", "The memories I have are slow and lucid, not at all like a hazy drunken night, but like a slow motion replay.  The nudity and debauchery of the show grounds was shocking to my vunerable, and uncontrollable mind. Thoughts of madness came like a runaway train. We walked bewildered through the carnival, I can remember the Dead walking out on stage, and immediately the legions of deadheads morphing from their given form into balls of bright light bouncing on the grass paddock that streched out before the stage.  That was the proverbial last straw.  I immediately sunk to my haunches, hands over face, and accepted that this was to be my life.  I was beaten, with what I had seen and felt in the last two hours, what could possibly make me right again, how could I get back... seeing me in this discombobulated state of disreason and fear, my cohorts pulled me to my feet, and carried me to the back door of the first aid tent.  I can remember my friends pleading for a glass of water, and the workers, who were frenzied with similar cases of overuse, demanding we leave, citing the long queu out the front entrance.", "Then, mercifully, they saw my beaten eyes, possibly straight through to my troubled soul. He can stay. I remember vividly a kind hearted, sweet middle aged women leading me to a green army cot. Lay down my son.  Take my hand. what did you take? Pills? Acid? I took mushrooms, a big handful, and now nothing is right, what the fuck is wrong with me, can anyone help... Gripping my hand with a comforting strength she spoke softly and directly. The Grateful Dead pays me to travel with them and help people in your situation. You will be fine. With this I stepped back away frow the edge. with every word I was farther from the breach which I was beginning to view as home.  She spoke for ten minutes, or was it an hour.  In the end I lay there, unable to move, and staring directly into the most beatiful blue eyes I had ever come across, and they stared back. The light was gone and the people were again dancing.  An hour and half later, the day was a gift, as were many to follow.", "I had gotten caps and stems that were humongous! From a close friend it was dried and the largest I have seen. My wife and I ate about 4 grams each, chewing them up and holding them in our mouths for about 2 minutes on an empty stomach. Within 20 minutes I started to feel giddy and had a perma-smile. I enjoyed being with my wife so much..in definite difference to the moods we had enjoyed together recently. Within 1 hour spider webbed patters glistened with various colors, and depth perception was trippy with my eyes constantly trying to adjust. We sat together watching tv...finally settling on a Chinese subtitled movie on cinemax. God to this day that son of a bitch was so intense it still scares me..my wife and I hugged kissed and knew how good it was to be alive. Sometimes i look back on that and thank the Gods for showing me what I had forgot,and the shame of letting something go thats so dear. Its waiting for you .....too.", "Wow is one word that perfectly describes my first experience with shrooms. Pot has been a part of my life for a few years now, and I have always been curious to see what shrooms would do to me. I had only heard good things about it and was ready to try it, but somehow never got round to it. Well it happened like this:", "One typical day, I was at a friends room, just smoking pot and relaxing with a few of my friends. Another friend came in and said he had shrooms, I imediately knew I was going to try it once and for all. I consumed maybe 1/16th of an ounce, and just sat there talking and waiting for the fungus to take effect. I didn't really feel it for like a half hour, but then it hit me. It went suddenly from relaxing to very intense in the room. ", "I was immediately removed from reality and thrown into my own little, lonely world. I was rolling, I mean i was totally rolling, over and over again. I was confusing myself and sort of flipping out. I was trapped in fear in a world that i thought I could not get out of, but desperately wanted to. I remember thinking, what I would give to have things normal again. I was freaking out. I started jabbering on, and really felt that I was annoying the others in the room. I wanted to stop and just chill, but couldn't. I hudled up in a corner of a couch and just kept talking to myself, convinced that I was going through a bad trip. It was way to intense for me to even look around the room and try and see visuals.", "My friends then picked me up and said that we all should go for a walk. Suddenly, my whole trip flipped upside down and I felt great, like a million bucks.....a billion bucks. The world had never been better, and I was ready to do anything. We all went into the basement and danced like crazy. It was great. I was seeing the sorroundings perfectly, things were spinning, I was just great.", "I ended up going to bed eight hours or so after I consumed the shrooms. I was still seeing small visuals when going to sleep. It was great. I woke up, had no side effects whatsoever.", "I intend to try shrooms again, hoping that the next time I do them, I won't have as an intense beginning. I definitely recommend that you try it once. Pot still remains my drug of choice, but shrooms may jump in my life once in a while.", "[Erowid Note: The following is a great mushroom trip report which has a number of well-expressed themes which are common to many mushroom experiences.]", "This excursion was a bit less coherent than the previous one, at least on paper. I am not, therefore, providing the text of what I wrote under the influence. Though it is based on those notes, this text was composed a couple of weeks after the experience. ", "SET: Supplicative. I feel I need this kind of communion in preparation for the upcoming visit with my family. I am encouraged by my previous experience, but want to clarify certain issues. ", "DOSAGE: About 4 grams dried psilocybin mushrooms, a few hits of cannabis, orange juice. ", "The effects begin 25 minutes after ingesting the sacrament. I am seated, breathing regularly, listening. As usual, it starts subtly. I have clear thoughts, ideas which strike me as somehow 'successful', but this is not by itself unusual. It can happen whenever one is quiet, focused, attentive to one's inner dialogue. The first real sign that the journey has begun is the familiar sense of descending. It is like a mist is falling within my head, muting and distorting the distant input of the senses, yet amplifying the much closer stimulation rising from within the body. It is at this stage that one realizes what one has gotten into -- and that there is no turning back. This is a moment of pregnant potential, filled with hope, curiosity, and trepidation. And then gradually, wetly, the carnival heaves into view... ", "One of the virtues of the psilocybin experience which others have reported is its strong visionary quality. Strangely, this has not been the case with me; but then, my experience is somewhat limited. The few visual images I have had were indeed very distinct and unusual, though fleeting and solitary. ", "Only one clear visual impression remains from this journey. It resembles a harp, as Picasso might have painted it. It surely could not exist in this universe. Its body is dark, and it seems to stand on a beach on some alien world, against a pink and yellow sky. Instead of strings, the curved, vaguely triangular shape of the 'harp' is repeated within itself, creating a kind of fractal lattice which recedes into the outer corner. There is no movement, just this mute and inexplicable still life floating up from the depths of my unconscious. ", "This was the sole clear visual I can recall. However, the whole mushroom experience always has an element of being 'shown' things -- but this showing is not a visual presentation of images so much as a visceral apprehension of fundamental truths. It is showing in the sense of 'understanding', as opposed to seeing in the usual sense. For instance, I am often confronted with the essence of a particular metaphor or archetype. Most of what follows is 'seen' in this way. ", "It is like a guided tour at the brink of the Abyss. The mushroom leads you to the cliff, and points, and commands you to look. To be sure, there is a guard-rail, and a concession stand, and the guide cracks jokes somewhat lamely. It can be banal, even silly, and the brochure guarantees that there is no danger of falling off the edge. But when you look into that darkness, see the stirring of great forms within it, hear the pounding and buzzing which echoes in its depths, you remember why you have come. You stand there, gazing over the edge of Life, gazing into that night, and something rises up before you. It breaks across the flimsy railing, and touches you right where you are Human. You see all life pouring past you over that trembling, aching lip, pouring back into the Mystery, receding into Truth, never slowing, constantly renewed. And you understand that someday you will stand at this precipice again. On that day, the concession stand will have been boarded up, the railing will be rusted to the ground, and the brochures will have long ago blown away. Then the only guide will be a familiar, quiet voice which beckons to you gently from the depths of the Mystery. ", "By far, mortality is the overwhelming theme of the mushroom trance. All else is commentary. Issues of life and death arise like idols before me, demanding sacrifice. It is a kind of reckoning. My mind is led directly to the instant of life's fleeting, without the crutches of distraction and numbness to which it is accustomed. There I am confronted with the things that make one take life very seriously -- issues of conscience, sacrifice, and responsibility. I behold with a shudder that I am living on borrowed time, and that the things I love most in life are all busied in their own passing. We are living on borrowed time, and how acutely now I feel that urgency! I write, 'Time is a call to responsibility: to live, to love, lest it end in tragedy.' ", "The mushroom catalyzes the ability to look at life -- at my life. The ground of human experience is that it is filtered through the perspective of the individual Self. Even this continuity, this 'I', is transitory. But as long as we live, this subjectivity is all we know and have, even as we strive to transcend it through art and action and love. When we forget this, when we forget that this life is uniquely our own, we lose sight of its value, we ignore its impermanence, and we become complacent, biding time until the reaper calls. ", "But understand also that we do not exist in isolation from the universe. That is an illusion, a trick of our sophisticated mind. Our life, our perspective, is unique. It is the mechanism of creativity. Yet we are all one substance, changeable. A mirror merely shows the universe presenting itself in a particular way, as with all things. Where is the distinction between my body and the world? Truly, the only distinction is in language. It seems to me that differences in shape and color and chemistry are superfluous creations of the linguistic mind. We are animate bits of a great cohesive Whole, rising and falling like waves. The Buddha has said this all before, and better. ", "It is daring me to BE. The mushroom is not impressed with idle speculation: it is truly the voice of conscience. It is my own inner voice, so rarely acknowledged, challenging me to go beyond myself. I hear it almost taunting me, laughing at my pretensions, waiting to see if I have the courage to act, waiting to see what I will Do. I sense the expectation of the world, waiting for me to make sense of it -- but not waiting for long! There will come a reckoning, even within my own heart, where my life will be seen for what it has been. When that time comes, will I be ready? And what if it were to come today? ", "I sense the potency behind everything: some call it God. Others call it Death, drawing us in. Newtonian causality insists that we are driven forward through time by the energy of the past. But are we not also drawn to our destiny, more or less willingly, by some strange attraction? The part of us that is Human yearns for something beyond itself: our life is a sense of longing -- stormy seas, the pangs of guilt... We have been drawn forward out of animal nature towards something bright and irresistible, a glittering bauble which we follow like children through veils of increasing complexity. Along the way we suffer terribly, but most terrible of all would be losing sight of that light and being lost in darkness. So we follow that light wherever it must take us, and we call it Hope. ", "Change is in our nature. We are at our most Human when we transform ourselves in the act of creation. So we must make our peace, somehow, with the inevitability of change. There is much talk of the need for unity, of the appreciation of the species, and of the planet, as a whole. Yet we watch in horror as global culture is reduced to the lowest common denominator: an infantile and chilling homogeneity which colonizes and kills the very diversity which typifies our species. Is this the unity we seek, a static monad, devoid of drama, emptied of color and hope? This is not the way of the universe. We are not here to simply merge indistinguishably into one another and vanish. To truly live we must introduce harmony into the world, to add our voice, just so, to the song of the universe unfolding. This is the creative act, and it is the jewel in the crown of Humanity. In creation we can introduce harmony where there was none before. It is the path to salvation. ", "But time is flying: I hear the wailing of the grave, 'Make a difference!' ", "Stories of light and dark, of history, and of Love, of a little boy who ate some strange mushrooms one day... We are nothing but stories in the void. Life is a narrative creation. Its body is made of language and memory; experience is its food. It is not forms which last, not deeds themselves, but the enduring drama of a particular life or event, as dramatized for others. The mark of a great life is that it is a story worth telling. The value of a deed is in what it provides for the memory of others. There is no scale to which this does not apply. Famous or obscure, we are ultimately responsible for determining how we will be remembered, if at all. ", "But where to find those stories? The mushroom tells me, 'You will find words in the living of your life.' The source of language, the source of its power, is in the immediacy of felt experience. We are some sort of alchemical filter by which the elixir of language is distilled from all the 'blooming, buzzing confusion.' I can see myself flying now past row upon row of ordered neatness called language. Ordered, yes, but how elusive! Do not presume to know it, though you dwell in it daily! It appears sometimes as a substance, sometimes as a creature, eating, growing, killing, remembering. It is neither friend nor foe, but wild like the beasts of the desert. Then again, it is the storehouse of culture, intimately bound up with the enigma of history. Language -- storytelling -- is the externalization of internal dramas, and as such, it is one portal by which novelty enters the world. ", "'The Jew is associated with forbidden knowledge.' This realization strikes me as strange. I wonder, what is its truth? I see in my heritage the roots of my love of language and books, of my desire to understand things. But I don't think in terms of 'forbidden knowledge.' Is this an explanation of the historical treatment of the Jews? Certainly in Medieval Europe they were associated with the Devil, and certainly there are economic and cultural explanations, but might these things have masked a deeper, more subtle cause? Could the almost mystical reverence for language shown by the 'People of the Book', in the midst of the illiterate Dark Ages, have stirred an unconscious fear? Mastery of language is a kind of magic, and here were the Jews with their scrolls of strange markings, borne aloft in the very heart of their sanctuary. Yes, the signs of Black Magic must have been all too clear! And at the center of it all, the mystery of language... But how does this relate to me? Is this a warning about my desire to share the 'forbidden knowledge' of the plant teachers? ", "The voice within me says clearly, 'Be thankful,' and surely I am. The only other option, when confronted with one's own mortality, is panic and fear, and the choice is mine. I am thankful for the blessings of family and friends, for the love that is shown me, and which is accepted from me in return. I am thankful for the godlike abundance that keeps me nourished, for the pleasures of new and diverse foods, and for hot water when I turn on the faucet. I stand in awe before the sacrifices of my ancestors, whose struggles and sufferings were unimaginable, that I might enjoy these things. I give thanks for all that there is, vanishing like a mystery. ", "I contemplate the importance of friendship. How magnificent are the achievements that are made possible by a friendly bond, how sweet are the joys! But also how poignant is the tragedy of being in the world without friends. I count my blessings, and vow to be more open to offers of comradeship. ", "Perhaps because it is the Thanksgiving season, this sense of gratitude is what has stuck with me, beyond all else. Continual thanksgiving is an antidote for the ego's fear of impermanence. They are two sides of the same coin. I want the knowledge of how lucky I am to stay with me, lest I be caught unawares when fortune changes. So I give thanks for all that there is, vanishing like a mystery. ", "I approached this session hoping to clarify where I must go with my life. At first it seemed my question had been ignored. After all, the mushroom shows you what you truly need to know, not necessarily what you want. But I realize that I have received ample clues to guide me. First, the sense of urgency at the passing of time, then the role of gratitude in overcoming fear. Then I was focused on the mystery of language. I have always thrilled at the challenge of trying to put thought into language, and doing it well. There is that moment of searching, and then the mysterious satisfaction when words come, condensing from some inscrutable source. There is the satisfaction of having those words acknowledged, knowing that they have inspired or provoked. It is in the skillful telling of stories that we are remembered, I have seen, and I want to be remembered as Good. ", "The mushroom has shown me what I must do -- though it remains for me to find the way. As it fades back into the glare of mundanity it speaks clearly once more. I write:", "'Be a teacher. Be a storyteller. Or be gone.'  'Be a teacher. Be a storyteller. Or be gone.' ", "I have experienced mushroom trips a few times before this experience so i felt bolder and more prepared to eat a larger quantity. My friend and I picked out a tranquil sunday and set off to his house in the country (i always feel more comfortable during any trips being outside-no walls).We ate our doses and decided to run to the store while letting them settle into our systems. ", "20 minutes and a joint later after a bit of meandering we packed a little bag and headed out to the stretched out cotton fields behind my friend's house. This is when the mushrooms really started to kick in. The mushrooms were beginning to take some effect during our walk past the horse stables toward the fields. The next thing i know it was raining! Out of the middle of sunshine it just exploded leaving us nothing to do but run for cover. We made to an isle of trees that seperated the fields and nestled into a comfortable dry spot. Then just as soon as it started, the rain stopped and the the sun bursted out into our faces like a door opening in the sky. This is when we really fell out of reality. ", "I remarked to my friend that something was behind that area of the blazen sky(or within it?) and it was so tremendous and powerful. Then i got the impression from whatever it was that i was a primitive ape. Some kind of strange evolutionary thought was being processed via the mushroom. He also 'felt' this command to feel primitive. We remarked to one another how this essence had made us feel so small compared to what was out in the sky. Then he began to get up and stumble away back towards his house and i sat there like some kind of flesh shell. then i mustered up some control and began to wander after my friend. ", "Next thing i know i am at his back door and he's flipping out. I entered the house and walked over to the bathroom. I looked over at my friend and saw someone else. Not him. I felt normal conciousness(along with memories) were 'transported' somewhere else beyond reach at this time. I moved over to the mirror and began to look at my blue tinged reflection not knowing who in the hell i am or this guy is in the other room talking about demons and lying in a fetal position on the bed. This went on with other unexplainable mental situations for sometime. I began to walk in circles around his house while i could hear the wood floors stretching and moving just as if it had been some type living organic material. I began to get sick and started throwing up in the toilet and out the back door (which ever was closer at the time) and outside looked like a stage set for some television show from another dimension. The sky had become dark by this time and the stars sent messages thru 'sequenced movements'. ", "I finally started grasping a fraction of what normal reality was and started talking myself down. My friend wasn't having this luck so i helped talk him down too. I told him to vomit because he was talking about going to the fucking hospital and those damn demons, aliens or whatever. Then it struck me i was tripping! Thru all of the previous drama we had both forgot we were tripping! We went so far out that we forgot how to come back. I started laughing and running around his house declaring 'WE ARE ONLY TRIPPING!' I repeated this like a mantra to help lift our spirits into a positive space. It worked my friend got up and we both agreed that we went out of our heads. Coming down was slow but more relaxed. We both learned something about life and reality that day even though some of it was very confusing and still complex to this day.", "This experience landed me in a Charter Palms Center and resulted in severe depression for about a year--during which I had to take Prozac to keep from killing myself.  Before the trip, I never had to worry about depression.  Five years later, I still take occasional herbal antidepressants (St. John's Wort).", "I went on a camping trip with a friend who brought a bag of shrooms from some picking that we did.  I had done shrooms several times before and enjoyed it.  We pitched a tent in an idyllic setting--waterfall, lake, trees, rocks--just a beautiful place where college kids go to camp and hang out.  I felt a little out of sorts though, prior to the 'shrooms.", "After taking five of the most purpled (small) heads from the bag, I felt nothing for an hour or so.  Then, as it got dark, I began to enjoy the experience--the stars and moon through the trees were angelic, dripping light, singing nature, dreamy colors.  We ate and talked by the fire, which I could not quit staring at--it was primordial and godlike.  ", "As things darkened in my mind (and in the woods), My friend--a hellova nice guy--began to take on evil dimensions to me.  I backed away from him as the fear crept in.  Things began to get bad and I told him so--he just kept saying that I was tripping and to think mellow thoughts.  In another hour I was in the tent, gripping the covers, trying to keep from falling up into the night sky, rolling in terror.  When my friend finally came into the tent, I told him not to let me leave the tent or I would smash my head on a rock until I bled to death.  I meant it.  He tied a string from his toe to the tent zipper opening so that he would wake if I left.  I suffered hard until daybreak.  Fear.", "By morning, the world looked completely different--as it does to anyone who suffers clinical depression--a brain drained of serotonin--the inability to feel pleasant in any sense of the word from any stimulus.  ", "I suffered this for weeks--never came out of it.  Tried several antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs prescribed by quack family doctors who dont know shit about the mind.  Lost my job because of my panic attacks and depression.  Lay in bed for months.", "Finally checked into a clinic and went through a real psychiatrist who prescribed prozac for a year.  I remember being able to do nothing but cry in his waiting room in front of other people who just stared.  I am not in any way emotional, but the chemical imbalance that existed after the trip turned me into a simpering mass of liquid emotion, fear, and blackness.  There are no words to describe the place I was in.", "If anyone experiences this all too frequent and long-lasting result of a bad trip, go to a real psychiatrist and get on Prozac--or the latest equivalent.  Take long walks.  The houses, cars and trees will seem evil to you--ignore them.  Trust people who want to help you.  Stay off of caffeine and alcohol while on the antidepressants.  Eat healthy.  Forget self-treating with beer, etc., it will just make it worse.  And for God's sake don't do anything stupid--you will recover in time.  I did.  I have been back from Hell for years now, and in a way i'm glad it happened because it was a death and rebirth experience for me.  Would never wish it on my worst enemy though.  ", "Now, pot and beer aren't a problem, but never again with the LSD-type shit.", "One Friday night about 11:00pm I got a call from a good friend saying he had some 'dank shrooms,' so I ventured out and purchased a few. My plan was to eat them the following night (sat) and I was indeed excited. Having eaten shrooms before, I figured I would have a blast. Saturday morning rolls around and I decided that today, 'I must fast,' so no eating the entire day and only drinking water. I believe this prepares me for the 'big trip' and makes it more intense.", "Saturday night and I prepare.  Backpack ready with bottle of water, smokes, CDs and a few books...and a few grams of good herb.  I grind the shrooms up very fine, adding them to a tea blend which I think was Lemon Zinger. Saving a few caps for during my trip, I proceed to drink my tea.  The first sign of mushroom tripping for me is a deathly feeling.  I lay on the bed, half convulsing and shaking, feeling really sick and wishing I hadn't eaten the shrooms when all of a sudden, 'Peace, Harmony, Silence, Noise, Alive and well.' Sick feeling is gone. God-like feeling has taken over.", "At this point, I hadn't really ever had many 'external visions,' but I just saw myself reach across the room and pick up my pipe.  My arm literally stretched across the room like Mr. Fantastic. Then I witnessed my friend first turn to melted flesh, then to bones, then to dust. Scary.", "Although having fun with hallucinations, I never expected what would come next.  As a meditator, I think maybe it would be cool to meditate while tripping, so I sit in the lotus position and begin a slow breathing technique.  Seconds later I see myself in a bright light with clouds all around and what seems like music from a lute inside and out of me.  Then I see what I believe to be the vision of Buddha floating on a cloud staring at me but not saying a word.  Also, the Dalai Lama is walking towards me and then becomes me and walks away. FREAKY.  The weirdest and most unusual of all is the vision of Jesus. It's giving me chills as I write this.  He stood upright and kinda floated over to me, but then suddenly darted fast and entered my body from my chest and then swam out. This revelation to me was the most intense vision I had ever experienced and it has changed my life, I do believe. I have tripped since and nothing compares. Nothing.  I believe that was my peak trip and I just hope that one day I can experience that again. Have fun.", "Never did I expect a trip like this!  I have eaten mushrooms before, 4 times, within the last 2 years.  But i have never really 'tripped' before.  I only felt giggly, warm inside.. that was about it.  But not this time.  I have had a high tolerance for mushrooms in the past, so i ate a lot more than normal. I wanted that 'trip feeling, the visuals everyone thinks is so great'.", "     At first, i became very tired..very sleepy. When the time came for the visuals,i wasnt liking it,so i fought it. As my boyfriend started 'bugging', i saw something weird in his face, in his reaction, that sort of freaked me out, and i wasnt sure i wanted to see what he was seeing. ", "     After about 30 mins. to an hour, I felt very weak, very light headed.  I would try to sit up, from laying down on the bed, and my body would completely give out.  I couldnt stand up, as much as i tried to fight it, i wasnt feeling right.  I started to vomit, over and over again, hoping it would knock itself out of me.. little did i know, not until almost 8 hours later in the hospital, i would be alright.  I became completely paralyzed, immobile.  I was experiencing fainting spells, when i tried to move myself.  I was carried to the hospital, and like 1000 pounds dropped in a wheelchair.  About 10 mins of crying in the ER, they finally took me in.  I felt like i was on a heavy dose of anesthesia.. throughout my body, but the funny thing was, i was completely aware of what was going on.  Or should i say the freaky thing was, i was completely aware of what was going on.  They did some blood work, to see exactly what was running through my body, and heart test.. my heart wasnt beating strong.  After given poison absorbent, i started to get feeling back in my body. (6 hours later)  The Dr. said, my nerves and muscles were affected, not permanetly, but until the poison would leave my body. Quote of the Experience: 'I thought i was paralyzed for life.'", "It was my and my best friends first time to try shrooms. We had our other best friend over, but he didn't want to try it with us. Which we thought would be a good idea to have someone not hallucinating with us. Our plans at first were to share a 8g bag between the three of us, but now since it was only 2 of us who wanted to try it, we just split it in half.", "We decided to go camping out in the back of my property, therefore we wouldn't have to worry about anyone seeing us and us getting some deep shit.  We got out there and set up the tent and built a fire. We didn't want to have wait much longer, so we soon started getting at the bag of shrooms. By god, they were about the nastiest things i've ever tasted, but i really wanted to try them, so i just ate them as fast as i could. ", "It took about 15-25 min. for them to start kicking in. The first hallusionations were simple, like colors getting brighter and out hands and feet stretching out and stuff. I realy cant say how long it was until out peak started, cuz our friend that wasn't goin to be takin shrooms with us was drinking, and we couldn't tell because weren't able to keep up with time. But when we peaked, really weird shit started happening. First, my friends that was taking them with me started to melt and i was like, OH SHIT!! So i layed down on the ground and i started seeing the sun coming up and it being day and then like 1 min. after the moon come up and be night and it continued for about 5 minutes until i looked up and saw my friend that had melted earlier's face hoovering above the fire. I turned around and started hauling ass down the pasture and i started seeing trees moving from about 50 meters away from me to right infront of me in a blink on an eye. It wasn't to long before i hit this great big tree and knock myself out. ", "Next thing i know, both my friend who had just recently melted and the one that was supposed to be keeping me from doin stupid shit like that was shaking me and my foot was in a big pot-hole, my ankle was sprained, and i had big contusion on my temple from god knows what (there was probably a rock on the ground or just hard ground, i dont know which 'cause there was both around me). My expierence is a prime example of what u dont want to do for a first time trial, buy high quality shit and take too much of it!! Always have someone there completley sober that you can trust to protect you from runnin off and getting hurt!", "Beware: This takes a while to get there...One friday evening, I made plans with a friend to go to a Ben Harper concert.  We planned to smoke a great deal of herb, but were looking forward to the likely consumption of mushrooms as well.  As can so easily happen in the uncertain world of illegal chemicals, we were unable to obtain the fungus.  The concert was very fun, but overlaid with the feeling that we SHOULD have had shrooms there, to complement the expectatory rush that looking forward to hallucinogenic experience usually engenders.  ", "While leaving the concert, feeling tired and a bit down (our marijuana had run its course, and we had foolishly neglected to bring any to the concert with us), my friend spied a guy who he recognized, and asked him if there were any shrooms to be had.  After some fiddle-faddling, we ended up in possession of a half-ounce of shrooms, to be split amongst three people (1.3 eigths apiece).  Now, by this time I was somewhat internally conflicted about the afair, as it was already pretty late, and I was thinking seriously about waiting until the next day to take the Flesh of the Gods.  But my two friends and I mutually convinced ourselves that we were young and sound, and could handle anything.  We downed the fungus at 12:30am, with no more grandiose plan than to trip in my dorm room, and then head out to the campus at some point to be amazed, and smoke more herb.  ", "After a good two hours of gummy, fantastic fungal frying in the room (everything seemed like a video game, but all quite lighthearted at this point).  At this point I think it worthy to note that on tuesday evening earlier that week, I had taken three hits of acid, and experienced an endlessly long stream of memories proving to me with hallucinogenic absoluteness that I was a terrible person.  That trip had yet to finish evolving within my brain (acid never really finishes with you), and I am at any rate a person constantly questioning who and what i am, and what I'm doing with myself.  Such questions can lead to scary places on hallucinogenic drugs!  ", "My shroom trip began to accelerate as soon as my two friends decided to go to campus and smoke.  I knew I was too fucked up to go, but somehow tripped myself into going along, despite deep misgivings.  I took my guitar along to ground myself.  I recall nothing of the walk to campus; I suddenly found myself on campus, very worried, and being hounded by my friends to get myself together, and go smoke.  I blanked out another stretch of time, and woke up to find myself in the midst of a seemingly endless forest of eucalyptus trees.  I had never been there before, and was absolutely lost.  ", "My friends once more began to hound me to smoke (I had the utensils in my pocket).  I was so far gone that I couldn't even comprehend wanting to do that, but I couldn't communicate with my fellow trippers at all.  One of them just thought I was fucking with him, and after a period of screaming at me, he wrestled me to the ground and got a lighter out of my pocket.  All I could comprehend was that the course of my life was taking me furthur and further away from who I wanted to be, and that there was no hope of stopping the process.  I lay down in the middle of the eucalyptus forest, clutching my guitar to my chest, watching my whole life reeling by me.  I saw my innocent childhood idiocies progress to less innocent idiocies, I saw every time I'd ever done what I knew to be the wrong thing when faced with a choice.  I watched all the porn I had ever seen gradually and cumulatively polluting my mind and spirit.  At some point I rose to my knees and began pitifully crawling, desparately trying to find something to connect my mind with my body.  ", "All of a sudden I was out of the eucalyptus (my friends had vanished; I didn't see them again until after the trip) and walking through campus, my guitar slung across my chest.  My mind had not slowed down one whit, and began to race forward, endlessly forward into the future.  I saw myself carrying out various interactions with complete strangers, all the while operating with values completely unrelated to all that I (whoever 'I' was) had ever known.  My future self lived countless lives in my head, each furthur disconnected from my sober reality. ", "Meanwhile, I walked.  I walked endlessly, playing guitar,  sure only that I was lost to all hope, doomed to walk the earth in isolated madness.  One of the most frightening aspects of the journey was the repeated instance of swirling blackouts: I walked for the most part with my eyes on the ground before me, but whenever I looked up, my vision spiraled out ahead of me, widening from the narrow scope of my shoes to the infinite world dissolving all about me.  My vision would then telescope back in upon me, swirling like a cartoon into nothingness. Then my vision would unwind out into a new scene, leaving me no remembrance of the ground I'd walked in between (later, reckoning the distances between those effectual blackouts, I was aghast to find that I would often go miles before refocusing my conscious vision). ", "Still I walked, and played, and saw my future, horrifying and alien, spin out before me.  The only continuity was that, in every bizzare movie of the future that I watched, I had my guitar, it was all I had to remind me that I had not always been the madman I felt myself become.  Finally, I reached a crossroads in the middle of campus from which I could not repair.  I tried to leave in each direction, but was unable to walk beyond the reach of the piercingly bright streetlamps outside a wholly unfamiliar building.  I was too scared to leave, and lost myself in abject despair.  I lay down finally, unable to walk and fight my mind any more.  I laid myself down to die.", "After some time of pure oblivion, I realized that I was not dead, and that i was freezing cold, and bone-wearyingly tired, in body and soul.  I picked myself up, and walked resolutely out of the crossroads, clutching at my sanity like a drowning man at a life-preserver.  I knew only that if I kept moving I would eventually find a place to sleep, to cast myself down and sleep until I knew that all this ravening chaos was but maya, illusion.  When I finally returned to my room, it was 6:30 in the morning.  My roomate (who had taken my lighter from me earlier) asked if I was all right, and I said 'Yeah.' My other friend was sleeping on my bed, so I put a piece of cloth beneath my head and lay down on the concrete floor.  I was too numbed by the wreckage of my evening to do anything but thank the god I don't believe in that I was myself, and still alive to fight another day.", "In a small, desolate corner of the desert, there isn't much for an average teenager to do. I had come to realize this and I had been analyzing the world around me - what did my life mean, who were my true friends... ect... ect... On this particular night, when there were no parties, nothing good at the movies, and definately no guys to be dating, I decided to treat myself to a special trip, besides my normal practice of driving around smoking bud and contemplating the mysterious of the universe while listening to music. So I met up with a friend who sold me approximately 5 grams of shrooms. One of my friends who was present at the time said that just looking at the shroom-filled cellephane 'gave him nightmares.' Indeed, they were fine shrooms, a white color with blue streaks throughout. There were several caps and many twisty, curly parts. ", "My parents were going out of town for the night, so on my way home from purchasing the shrooms I munched on about 2 grams to get my trip started, but where I could still funtion enough to tell my parents goodbye. After they had left I still wasn't feeling any of the effects so I munched down on the remaining 3 grams and decided to kick back for the night. While coming up I watch a fairly corny movie, 'Coyote Ugly' (trust me, not my typical shrooming flick of choice), but I got a lot of humor out of it, and noticed all the really cheesy parts, but appreciated them at the same time. As the shrooms started to take effect I turned my room into a tripping palace. I turned on the black lights, lit some incence, and popped in Incubus's (some of the best shrooming music, in my opinion) 'Make Yourself' and 'The Fungus Amoung Us.' ", "For about an hour to an hour and a half I kinda just lounged around, tripping out on how the music was intensifying and the color change and visuals and such. During this time I was also contemplating how I could make my life better, and how I felt like I had some much more to offer the world than this little dirt town could offer me. I also rolled two joints :)", "After about an hour and a half of tripping two of my friends stopped by, with a bottle of Parot Bay and a 40 oz. of Mickey's for me. We drank, smoked bud and cigarettes, drank some more, and laughed. My friends were a little startled by my trip, after all, they were drunk, and had never really been around a shroomer before. They kept telling me how dilated my eyes were and I kept telling them how happy I was that they were there for me, when so many of my other friends had left, and how I could have fun without those other friends (many of my old friends had left for college and I was kind of in the middle of an identity crisis about it). The drinking and smoking only added to the high, and I started to speak in whispers and comment on the rainbows that were flowing from my friend's mouths, that's when they decided to leave. ", "When they left I decided to spend some time with nature and went outside and just lounged around the yard and then went for a short walk around the block, just to take in the beauty of the place that I loved, but for so many reasons felt like I hated. I also smoked another joint. The sky was beautiful that night, with many colored lights streaking the sky. When I got home I was really tripping (and getting cold) so I cranked up the music and let the trip flow. I started to remove all of my clothing, almost a 'spiritual striptease' because I wasn't exactly being seductive, I was admiring my own beauty of the temple of my body and appreciating it's every line and curve. I was peeling away the tight restrictive 'uniform' or the front that I put on everyday, and became bare, became me. ", "I stared in the mirror for a long time (for one I always trip on how my eyes look when I'm shrooming) and then started dancing around my room. I was dancing in the most fluid fashion, simply letting my body flow. I felt unrestrained, I felt that I was letting my spirit free from being bound down so long. I had also lit incense all around and the smoke was totally tripping me out. I could see it hovering just at eye level with me, it was an extremely cool visual. One startling experience, as 'The Fungus Among Us' CD came to an end, my three disc changer went on to the next disc. An unusual noise, a noise that surprised me, yet excited me started, and an unfamiliar CD started to play, but the words and the music sounded so beautiful, I could definately relate. This might sound corny, but the next day I discovered I had been listening to the Stroke 9 'Nasty Little Thoughts' CD. This might sound cheesy to some, but trust me, I had a totally religious experience over it. ", "By this time I was having some bad-ass open eye visuals. I could hardly see my room any longer, it was if a screen of red and blue swirly dots had covered my eyes. I layed down and covered up and had a long series of open/closed eye visuals, and then slowly drifted into a peaceful sleep. I wasn't 'hung over' or anything the next morning, in fact, after going to sleep at 5 in the morning after a 6 hour trip, I woke at 8 AM, ready to start my day in the beautiful new world that I had discovered the night before. Emotionally, I felt pretty happy, pretty satisfied. I felt that I had found something beautiful within myself, and even if no one else knew it was there, I knew it, and I had seen it, and that comforted me.", "I had a bit of a sad or depressed undercurrent to the whole thing. I found myself missing old friends and lovers and wishing that I could still share times as wonderful as the night before with them, but for the most part I was content and very satisfied with the trip....", "I have issues with substances hitting my system well and quickly, causing stomach discomfort in many situations that I find detracts from at least the onset of my substances of choice.

Me and 2 of my friends decided that it would be a good idea to celebrate the turning of the new millenium with a good mushroom trip. We had all tripped together before so I was comftorable just sitting at home tripping with 2 of my close buds. So anyway we wanted to peak right around mid-night so we figured we should eat them around 11:00. My friend didnt really feel like eating the shrooms so he decided he would make some tea, while me and my other friend would chew them up.

I still felt a little nauseous from the taste of the mushrooms, so we smoked a bowl. It calmed my stomach right away, and I could tell that I was really going to enjoy this trip. The hallucinations were constant now and I had a feeling of being at total peace. Me and my friends just layed in the living room staring at the ceiling for what seemed like an hour. In actuallity it was only around 11:40, the new millenium was approaching! But I just layed there taking in everything that these mushrooms had to offer. The feeling was incredable! I was taking very deep breathes just trying to comprehend all that I was seeing and feeling.", "It had just turned 12 and the trip suddenly turned from a visual experience to a mental experience. We sat there talking for a while when I began to feel really overwhelmed by what I was feeling. My mind started to race faster than it ever had before, and I began feeling a little uncomfortable. I had some weed so we decided we should pack a bowl. I was so out of it that I couldn't even handle packing the bowl, I had no choice but to let my friend pack it. We smoked it but unfortunately it didnt help. The thoughts in my head were uncontrollable, I had this urge to just walk out of the room and go to bed. My 2 friends were enjoying there trip, they were 'bonding' much I like I had done in my previous trips, but I felt somewhat left out. I now HATED being there. I just wanted to go to sleep, but my mind was racing way too fast.", "By now it was around 1:30am. At around 2:00am my friends sister showed up with about 15 of her friends, they had just returned from a local New Years Eve party. From here my night just got worse.

My mind was in such a state of confusion that I was able to hold a conversation with some one, all of my social skills were gone. So everyone pretty much left me to my self. I just sat there for what seemed like days, wishing I could somehow just go home.", "Finally at 4:00 in the morning my mind slowed down enough to where I thought I could go to sleep.

Im not done with mushrooms, I just look at the whole thing as a learning experience.", "So just a few final words: don't let this story discourage you from using mushrooms, because it's a great mind expanding drug. Just dont rule out the possability of things not going exactly how you had planned.", "Have fun, be safe, and remember theres always sweet Mary-Jane!!...420", "It was a Friday after school and me and 4 friends scored on a half ounce of mush. So we each took around three and went to seven eleven to get some munchies after about a half an hour one of my friends was complaining about his stomach hurting I told him it was normal(i had done mush before he hadn't) so he calmed down and after a little bit began to feel okay. That's when it hit me. I had done mush before but only 1 gram maybe 1.5 so I wasn't ready for what happened. I was walking in this field and all of a sudden everything died and blossomed into the scene from gladiator where he's walking through the meadow and my mind felt like it was connected with nature and my self I felt as if I could do anything. Then my friend started tripping out at this squirrel that walked by and said it looked like his mom and we sat in the field and laughed then major open eyed visuals kicked in and everything was either blue, orange, yellow, or green . And little hippie flowers were floating around everywhere and I thought I was floating too. Then I stared into the clouds and so little stick mean Indians with spears do a very meaningful dance and I felt connected again with everybody and then I was in the meadow again where I stayed their living in a dream for the best 3 hours of my life.", "I had recently been in search of magic mushrooms for quite some time now. I tried going through one of my friends to hook me up, but that never happened. So... I eventually recieved 1/8 from one of my friend's boyfriends.", "It was a Thursday night and I had just finished eating supper with my mother and father. I was never so anxious to finish a subway sandwhich. I practically skipped up my stairs and retreated to my room. I had stored the mushrooms in a box in my cabinet that my parents never check. It was time.", "I sat down at my computer, made sure I had plenty to drink, and proceeded to eat the foul tasting shroomies. It was about three handfuls, on the second i found myself almost gagging. I took a sip of water. With the mushrooms ingested, all i could do was wait and get ready for the journey I was about embark on.", "I knew the early signs on what to look for before tripping. I was very anxious, and a chill came over me, like a cold metal foil was wrapped around my body. I was starting to see auras around lights and reflections of glasses started to show off rainbow colors. This was only the beginning of it all. ", "I decided to move to a more comfortable place and prepare for my trip. I layed down on my cozy bed, more anxious than I have ever felt. I found myself starting to stare at inanimate objects and household furniture. I layed on my back only to realize that my ceiling had become a black ocean with white mountains protruding from its underneath. This amazed me, I was in awe. Patterns in the mountains started to come about. My eyes were tearing now, which scared me. I was thinking maybe I took too many and it's having effects on me. Maybe my brain was leaking!! nah... but I know I was scared when this started to happen. I was freezing now, I dont know what had come over me.", "I sat upright on my bed and began staring at my closets and the space between the two. A small deer's head was perched in the middle of the closets. It was an ominous and overpowering figure to me. I thought I heard him speaking to me, as to worship him as a God, for he was so high above me. I got on my knees and started to pray... but why? I got up and smacked myself. 'This isn't happening', I repeated. I sat back on my bed to only find myself staring at the closet space again. Now patterns and colors were taking effect in my mind. The space turned a bright orange, and shots of spirals spewed through the wall. My eyes wandered and hit a lamp. The lightbulb in the lamp seemed to have an alien face of sorts on the inside. It was telling me, 'Come fight me, you can't so anything, you weak fool, Come fight me now!'... 'Fuck you!!', I yelled out. I was going nuts. This was pure insanty. I layed down on my bed, mouth to my pillow, proceeding to blow warm air into as a relief. As I did this, the ground ballooned up. I sucked the air in that I blew into the pillow and realized I was controlling this phenomona. wow! ", "Later that night, in the peak of my trip, I proceeded to draw what was on my mind. As I drew, my arm moved itself. My hand was not drawing this picture, it was my mind. The pure energy of my mind had been moving this pencil the whole time. ", "Voices, many voices could be heard now. So many languages. Different cultures speaking in a trance-like melody creating music as it went along. I could not understand a word of it, yet it was beautiful and enlightening. I started to realize, 'Why am I here? What is this place I call home? What is this place we call earth?' The thoughts kept coming with the answers only being more complicated than the last. I sat down once again. My hands had become the largest things around. Kind of like the Foo Fighters - Everlong song. I outstretched my hand and realized I had hawk like vision. Every crevice could be seen in my hand. It was an amazing thing to see, every detail which couldnt never be seen by the naked eye was all exposed to me right now.", "Visions were everywhere, patterns forming on the floor, only to stay there and always be there. Not moving, yet I couldnt take my eyes off of them. Animals were forming from thoughts, and mostly, a reoccuring red fox, found in the right hand corner of all my visuals, like a trademark.", "This is the most I can write of my experience for now. Alot is a blur, yet alot is beautifully clear.", "     The night that me and you shroomed, when we first got that ounce, I had a feeling that left me unsettled. It felt as though something was building up. I was curious about it, but I still fell subject to the hallucinations that every shroomer receives. My curiosity caused me to shroom again the next night, in order to find out what was going on. This time, as I sat alone in my room, my mind opened up to me a little. I began to think more with my mind than with my brain (metaphorically). I began to look critically at myself, and question how I fit into the system of life. I thought I was onto something but didn't know what. The shrooming continued. The morning we drove home for the holidays, I had taken a couple grams. I didn't dwell any deeper into my mind on this trip, it was a waste.", "     The second night in Windsor I shroomed with Kristin and Mei. I ate about 3 grams. It began as a normal mushroom trip would, but soon I left Mei's house, because I was agitated, and went to Fect's brother's house with Nate and Pierre. That's where it hit me, hard. I stared at the corner of the wall in his kitchen. I was deeply into thought when I started getting two distinct sets of thoughts. One, I could tell was the thought process of my brain. It thought about 'important' things in life. The way you might think when you're stoned. It could go into depth about any life issue. The other set of thoughts were similar to the thoughts I received the time me and you shroomed. I considered these the thoughts of my mind. The weird part is that these thoughts weren't mine. I put no effort into these thoughts. As if I wasn't thinking, it was just happening. ", "     I decided to dwell on these thoughts. The two sets of thoughts were so distinct that they started 'arguing' with each other. They argued about which was the proper way to really live. The whole time I struggled, to the point where I thought I couldn't take it any more and that I was going to go crazy. Meanwhile, I kept staring at the wall and smoking joints like nothing was happening. However, crazy shit was happening. As the battle for my conscience continued to build, I decided that I'd go crazy if one of these 'voices' didn't leave. ", "     That's when my mind took over. Without putting effort into thought, my mind explained that the reason my brain is stuck on the dealings of life is because I know nothing of anything else. I've lived my whole life trying to better adapt myself to life, the way every person does. Instead I should have spent that time bettering myself, period! The voice was like the voice of Goodness. Every time I questioned it, it replied with the perfect answer, the right answer. I don't know how long this event took place but it felt like hours. The mind explained to me that the path to Goodness is through the mind, not the brain. The brain is only capable of dealing with life functions. The mind is so powerful, that it can communicate with other minds in a realm that is undefinable by man. ", "That's when it got nuts. I left my body. I became all mind and I could even look through my mind and see my body, sitting there, staring at the wall. I don't know what it was, but it was amazing. Everything was suddenly so clear. The mind continued to explain things. It told me that every person is capable of thinking with their mind. They are mostly held back by the strive for betterment in life, and by the exponential rate at which life has grown away from Goodness. It explained that fundamentally every person is the same. All are capable of the same thoughts. It is through experiences that each person is molded into what they are now. Then it questioned me. The very question that I now ask so many people. It said, 'Would experience be valued, as highly as it is, if mankind had chosen the wrong path in the beginning of its existence?' Instead of constant appreciation for the Goodness that created all, man became instantly obsessed with personal betterment in life. Then the self-righteous disease spread like a wild fire. Now it's so well practised that most people don't even believe in the original Goodness. ", "     I continued to learn from the mind. It stressed to me that no one can achieve the realization from another man. It comes from complete understanding. I saw that this was true because I didn't grasp anything the mind said, until I worked it out and it made sense. Complete sense. The lesson continued. I questioned about the use of drugs, I wondered if all of this was just a part of the mushroom trip. It replied that natural psychedelics (peyote, shrooms, etc.) are a gift, they were given to us in order to achieve a connection to Goodness through the mind. It explained that marijuana isn't a connection to the mind, it's a method of dwelling into life. ", "At first this sounded as though weed was a regression from the mind. I reasoned that the peaceful state of the high is a good way to relieve life's stresses. This, I figured, couldn't possibly be bad. The mind then explained that the true vehicle to the mind is in psychedelics. The hallucinations that accompany the trips are just obstacles to challenge you into examining your mind. Remember, you can't learn the realization, so it won't be simply given to you through a drug. You must completely understand the realization. ", "The clearest impression that remained in my mind that night, was when I was told that I'd never go back. It kept telling me that this voice was here to stay. I still didn't know whether or not it would change me for sure, but I can tell you now, that it never left me. It consumed me that night and I'll never think the same again.", "Now I am at peace, at peace with everything. Right after the realization trip I focused hard on eliminating all the stresses and uselessness that governs my current life. I began to rid myself of all inhibitions. I no longer looked at people and tried to get into their heads to see what they were thinking. Now I looked at people and thought about how they were going about things completely wrong, as if they were blind. However, this turned out to be a short selfish phase, but the realization was growing and wouldn't allow me to continue that way. At present, I realize that I have the chance to change things. I feel confident that I can make a huge difference. I still focus on myself to the degree that I'd prefer to leave what I have here. I don't think I can make a difference if I continue to live the conventional life. I want to show the world the freedom of the mind, and I will! You can't imagine the pride I now have in you, after that email. I feel like Goodness has crowned you a general in his army. As long as you continue to understand and allow your mind to grow, the realization will always have a warrior penetrating the system of life.      ", "     To succeed you have to practice what you preach, you have to loose all of your inhibitions and begin thinking with your mind. Your mind holds the answers to everything in life and beyond. Be peaceful and teach peacefulness. The realization movement will begin with us. It grows stronger everyday and will unite every man and women.", "One saturday a friend of mine and I, made plans to get some shrooms, and take them early in the day (10 am), and enjoy the nice summer day while tripping out.  I had worked a nightshift the night before, and had only gotten a few hours sleep since, so I was pretty wired to begin with.  ", "We began our journey in the kitchen, I chowed down some chocolate cake, topped with mushrooms, and he had a peanut butter, jam, and fungus sandwich. About 10 minutes later, we changed our venue to the back yard.  We smoked a joint, set up our lawn chairs in a shadey spot under a tree, and began to relax.  The atmosphere in his yard was spectacular.  Lots of trees, bushes and flowers.", "30 minutes later, the insanity began. The colours in the trees got a little sharper, the clouds above me seemed to move up and down.  Nothing out of the ordinary (I had done mushrooms and acid before, but not this much, so I thought I knew what to expect).  The warm sunlight began to feel quite good on my skin, so I closed my eyes and enjoyed the feeling.  I then went into, what seemed like a state of sleep.  I thought about what a good feeling was shooting through my entire body, I could 'see' the sensation in my mind.  It became more than just a feeling, it became like another sense altogether.  I began to think that I had lived with it all my life.  It seemed like sight, sound, and touch wrapped up into one package.  I have no idea how long I stayed in this state.  I can only guess it might have been 10 or 20 minutes.  That was the point where I started to lose touch with reality.", "I awoke from my daze, to find that my travelling partner had gone inside earlier (reasons only known to him), so I went in to see what he was up to.  I can't remember what he was doing when I found him, as some details of the day are sketchy, but I know he wasn't doing anything stupid.  We then opted to go downstairs and watch a movie.  As I walked down his stairs, I would occasionally stop, and stair at pictures on the wall.  People in the pictures would blink, and sometimes wave at me.  I finally made it to his couch, and a problem arose with watching the movie.  Both of us had forgotten how to operate a VCR!", "Soon I found myself back in the kitchen.  The shrooms were begining to peak.  No longer would I have to walk from room to room, I would just find myself there, with no recollection of how I got there.  I met up with my friend's cat, hobby.  She had entertained me during an acid trip a few months beforehand, so I thought I'd have another staring contest with her.  I looked directly in her eyes, and I felt a connection with the animal.  It was as if we shared one concsiousness.  Visually, I could see every minor detail, and hair on her face.  It was the most vivid image I had ever layed eyes on. Suddenly, she turned her head and bolted under the couch.  At that point, I felt rather sluggish, so I opted to stand in the middle of the kitchen floor, and stare at my feet.  After a few seconds of staring, my eyes began to go out of focus, the colours in my feet became brighter, and before I knew it, I was standing with Mickey Mouses feet and legs.  This didn't bother me at all, I actually thought it was really really cool.", "In search of more entertainment, I sought the company of my guitar.  This would prove to be the best part of my day (well, except for eventually coming down).  When I look back on it, the tunes I was playing would probably have sounded really bad to a sober person, but at the time, the were pure gold to me.  I played a series of random notes and chords, not repeating anything.  I closed my eyes and began to visualize the music telling a story without words or pictures, just music.  It was truely amazing.  I began to repeatedly play one chord, getting louder and louder with each strum.  I could see each vibration of each string in slow motion.  The sound became so loud and so dense, it seemd to completely encase my body.  I was floating in sound.  It's difficult to explain how to 'see sound', but I did.", "In the meantime, my friend was having a bad, bad trip.  He was in his bathroom, trying to vomit because he didn't want to get any higher, he said.  He wouldn't let me come upstairs because he said I tripped him out too badly, and that our trips were feeding off each other.  It is impossible for him to explain to me what was going on in his head, just as it is impossible for me to completely explain to you what was going on in mine.", "I can't remember any specific time at which my trip went to hell.  I began to lapse in and ouch of consiousness.  I began to forget what I looked like, and what my name was.  At one point, I thought I was my brother.  Fear set in.  I went back outside to see if I could calm myself down.  I was losing touch with reality, my vision was completely blurred, and I had little depth perception.   My eyes seemed to see what was in my imagination before they saw what was directly infront of me.  I had to use all of my concentration just to see his house.  I began to get more scared because I didn't know that this was a common effect of mushrooms.  In all of my experiences with fucking my brain up with weed, and even smaller doses of mushrooms, I had never lost it like this, so I began to worry.  Was I dying? Would I ever be normal again?  I could barely remember how to be normal, or what it was like when I was.  I began talking to myself, trying to have some reassurance that it would all be ok in a few hours, but who was I to talk, I was completely fucked out of my gourd.  I went back inside and tried to talk to my friend.  He was going mental.  He shouted at me 'Just go outside! We can't be around each other!'.  I tried to talk sense into him, but I couldn't begin to find the words or thoughts.", "I needed someone from the real world.  I began racking my brains for friend's phone numbers.  I could only remember about 5 numbers, and nobody was home.  After I had dialed a few times, I began to forget what the numbers I was dialing meant.  The series' of digits began to melt together in my mind.  I almost considered calling my mom, and even worse, 911.  I began to pace back and forth, trying to make some sense of the situation.  All this time, the song 'Canon', was playing on the stereo.  It sounded like background music in the movie that was my life.  The more I concentrated on the music, it would change pitch, like a cassette player slowing down and speeding up.  I suddenly remembered another friend's phone number.  I called him, and thank god, he was home.  Frantically, I explained to him that we were tripping out really badly.  He laughed at me.  This didn't make me feel bad because it gave me the feeling that what I was going through was normal.  I asked him to come over just to hang out, so I could have some semblance of reality there with me.", "The doorbell rang.  It was my tripping partner's girlfriend.  He had called her when he was upstairs, with the same intentions that I had - Find a normal person to make us better again!  I remembered that he said something about going down to the park at the end of the street to sort things out with his brain, so her and I went to find him.  We brought him back, and sat around and chilled out.  ", "I was starting to come down.  It had been about 5 hours since we ate the shrooms.  The friend I called to come over showed up, and he took us for a drive around town (best car ride EVER!).  I was still pretty fucked up, still hallucinating little things, but at least I had most of my mind back.  I could behave like a civilized human being again.", "I left quite a bit out of this story. Either because I don't know where it fit in the time-frame of the day, or just because I couldn't remember it all together.  I remember pieces of events, blurred visuals, but nothing too concrete to be able to explain.", "I had never experienced fear like I did that day.  That isn't to say that I didn't enjoy it or benefit from the experience.  I now know and respect the power of psychedelics.  Anybody who's ever tripped out that much, knows that words alone cannot describe the experience to someone who has never tried it.  It's unimaginable.  I, myself, can't even imagine or remember what it was truely like.", "One thing is for certain - that is definitly NOT going to be the last time I do shrooms!", "You should really know the background of my state of mind to understand the physically and emotionally draining trip that I went through. My boyfriend was living in another town and making it quite clear that his other friends were his top priority at the time. I was missing him and the fun we used to have together. I was at school, getting prepared for another boring weekend (as usual) when I heard that 'shrooms were coming into town. I had done 'shrooms several times before, and love the trip, so I decided, 'This will liven up the weekend....' I talked to a friend after school and bought about three grams.", "I decided that I would spend the trip at home, watching some trippy movies. I went to the video store, and en-route I munched on the shrooms. I rented Bram Stroker's Dracula and then drove around and smoked a bowl before going home. When I got there the coming up time was actually kind of pleasant. There was no really big time visuals or even light changes throughout the course of the trip, although, I watched Dracula and tripped out on some of the visuals in the movie, not knowing if they were really there or if I was hallucinating them.", "When the movie was over, I turned on the blacklight, lit some incense, and put in Smashing Pumpkins' latest disk (great tripping material, I might add) and kicked back for a relaxing trip. But then, as I often do when I'm tripping, I started thinking. Only, most of the time my thoughts take me on far away voyages, expanding the horizons of my mind, but this time they were making me terribly uncomfortable and sad. I was thinking about my boyfriend, and how much I missed him. I started thinking how life would never be the same without him, etc....etc.... (You know, totally radical, extreme tripping ideas.) I started looking at all his pictures and reading every letter he had ever written me. I started crying uncontrollably. The music sounded like rain, and I felt as if life was raining down upon me and I cried and cried and cried. I then heard a knock at the door. Having no idea who it could be I took some time to try and compose myself. The music seemed to be blaring and I was trying to wipe my eyes and make myself presentable. By the time I answered the door there was no one there, and that really scared me. The knocking had seemed so loud.", "I was almost terrified, and I started crying uncontrollably again. I thought, 'The only way to end this is to go lay down and sleep it off.' I took off my clothes, slipped under the covers, and tried to drift off to sleep just so the trip would stop. It may seem kind of strange, but I actually had some really light, yet cool, closed eye visuals during this time. I guess I eventually fell to sleep, and woke up the next morning feeling relieved, yet still a little depressed. I came to find out that it was my boyfriend who had been knocking at the door, but I must have taken more time than I realized to answer it, because he had decided to leave, even though he thought that my music was a little too loud for me to be asleep. I was really grateful that he didn't see me like that, because, although we smoked bud and tripped out together all the time, he was kind of protective about me tripping when he's away. He always wants to make sure that there's someone there to take care of me.", "Anyways...I have 'shroomed several more times after this bad experience, and they have been some of the best trips. It was just the wrong time, I was sick, sad, and lonely. I don't let one bad trip ruin 'shrooming for me. There is life after a bad trip.", "My suggestion to anyone who is considering taking a maiden voyage on shrooms, is to get some basic info on them first.  I had gone over to a buddy's home just to hang out.  My girlfriend and I were on very bad terms, and I decided that hanging out with the boys would help ease some tension.", "Unknown to me, they had purchases about 2g of shrooms for me to experiment with.  They were veteran users and assured me that it would be very pleasurable.  Before this, I had only been an occasional toker. So I tried it, along with a bunch of healthy hoots from my bong.", "I washed it down with a few beers and after half an hour nothing seemed to be happening, while all the while I hadn't noticed that I was getting full of energy.  ", "The first signs came when I went to the washroom to take a piss.  I looked at myself in the mirror, and noticed my pupils enlarging and shrinking like flashing railroad crossing lights.  ", "I went back into the living room where my two friends were waiting and told them what I saw.  My one friend handed me a picture of a motorcycle and asked me what I saw.  I noticed the traffic behind it in the picuture was moving at an incredible rate.  ", "Bigger changes occured in the next couple of hours.  A black cat was sitting behind my one friend smoking a cigar for a few seconds at one point.  I was in the kitchen at another time watching popcorn be made with an air popper.  This was fun since the popcorn looked like a waterfall the way it was coming out and I began swimming around the kitchen.", "It turned ugly quick as I became violently angry with the one friend since he wasn't saying much to me.  I thought he was up to something and was planning my demise and was the cause of all the world's frustrations.  (Later I realized that this was a venting of the tension between my girlfriend and me).", "For most of the trip I was violent, however by reading articles and stories after the fact, I know how to influence the trip to be a more pleasurable one in the future.  Looking forward to it!", "What I took I am still not sure about to this day, but it has no resemblance to any psilocybin trip that I have heard of and is a lot closer to the LSD trips that I have heard of.  Of course many people say that the trips are very similar.  I had done shrooms once before with a friend and had eaten an eighth of them then as well.  I smoke marijuana a little more than occasionally and was intrigued with tripping.", "Christmas break was arriving and I was to go home for it from college.  I was bringing a whole half of an ounce for me and my friends.  The night that we decided to do it turned out very awry.  My ex girlfriend and her friend came over and my best friend and me and them ate these shrooms at nine o'clock PM.  We ate them with Teddy Grahams, which makes them quite tasty.  They were dried and covered in blue something.  Stripes of blue all up the sides and everything.  In our haste we walked right by my parents and I realized that I forgot to say goodbye, something odd.  I said that I should go back and I went in to talk to my mom.  She tried to engage me in conversation and I noticed that I was having massive problems with communication.  I was already tripping!  That is one thought as to why LSD might have been on it.  We drove up into an area called the Canon behind my house and we decided to walk around.  It was cold, though and we soon came back to the car to sit and wait for the onset of the shrooms.  I was already feeling very, very odd.  I was laughing almost uncontrollably at everything and I realized that I was really tripping when I couldn't stand being in the car anymore.  I was squirming all about and even started crawling all over the seats.  So, we got out of the car to walk.  ", "Nobody was quite feeling it yet except for me.  A bad part was probably that I was doing it with my lovely ex only three weeks or so after we had broken up and maybe two after she had screwed another guy and only after she had come back to me.  Emotional problems were very hard that night.  I noticed that I couldn't explain very much very easily as we were walking.  My ex was laughing hysterically and I realized that I wanted her to shut up so I turned around and screamed at her, not feeling what I was actually saying.  I wanted to hug her and tell her that I was sorry, but I was completely afraid of anyone touching me.  Especially my best friend.  He had the appearance of a circus clown in a certain light and I wanted him more than anyone not to touch me.  Well, he was the only one that would come near touching me.  I was pacing in circles and raving in my head, thoughts going so fast that I don't remember what they were.  I remember my ex dancing in the street like a little hippie and her friend being completely stagnant, so I stopped paying attention to them.  I stepped off of the road for a car and in the snow (the melted holes to the ground) was a face of a skull staring at me, gaping with its jaws in a sinister laugh.  I remember then that everyone was in the snow piling it into their faces and my friend Ian was raving about how we needed to be with our friends and go to the woods.  I was afraid of the skulls and bones in the snow so I stayed on the road, which enraged him.  I started to see a low humm on the horizon of mixed colors, blue, green, red, yellow, it was beautiful.  ", "I then looked to the sky and I saw the stars melting downwards.  They were very pretty and I asked one for its permission to hold it.  I then reached up ito the sky and pulled it down to talk to it.  I played with it for a moment and then let it snap back into position as though rubber attached it to the sky.  Then the stars took me over, I battled them.  They captured me and all that I can say was that I was locked into their gaze with this orgasmic like feeling all through my body.  I know that I was moaning very loudly as it felt amazing.  When I finally accepted the stars into me I saw the face that was in the stars.  Later I associated this face with god, but not until later.  At this point I was just communicating with it through my mind.  My ex's friend had grown cold (she had eaten maybe a half of an eighth) and she had my ex walk back to the car with her.  I knew that I was losing my mind and that I was on the verge of not being able to make rational decisions, so I voted to follow them as Julia, my ex's friend, had thoughts of real things like cold which I could only understand that I could not understand.  She seemed still sane to me. My friend, Ian, was in the bushes raving about how we were all fucking idiots and we could not leave it behind.  I somehow convinced him to come with me, I think because he cared about me and knew that I was too scared to stay without the sane one, Julia.  I went to them and just sat under a streetlight with my ex thinking and telling Julia that she was sane and I didn't want her to leave or we would be lost.  She decided to walk home, about three blocks, and then we were lost.  ", "Ian returned to the riverside woods and my ex and I sat raving in a streetlamp aura like maniacs.  We had taken some vitamin C because of what we had heard about how it makes it better.  I subsequently had the bottle in my sweatshirt pocket.  I started thinking then for the first time about how she had screwed that other guy because she started saying that she could not differentiate between there and where she goes to school.  Well, she was trying to say that but it kept coming out that she couldn't tell the difference between me and her fling-buddy.  I didn't care at this point, I thought that it didn't matter because it happened, oh well.  Then I turned and in my hood I saw LONG blonde hair next to my face, like her fling-buddy had.  I thought suddenly that I was him and he was me.  The reason that she had confused the two places was due to the fact that he did things like go insane on drugs and her image of me was always a little more conservative, although I am quite the opposite.  Well, I suddenly became filled with the idea that this guy and I were one complete person and we were individuals of a single human side.  He was happy, goofy, joking, flirting.  I was romantic, serious, thinking, loving.  We became one at that moment.  ", "Then I turned away from her and looked to the tree.  Again, like with the stars, I became rapt with some odd power that overtook my entire body.  It screamed into me and I stared at this tree as it froze with a solid sheet of ice over it and then turned into a face of an old man, quite like the stereotypical god image with the beard and heavy brow.  We communicated for a while through our minds and expressions and then he turned into man, many faces.  They were all staring at me when one of them looked at me as though I had stepped on its toes.  I turned and ran away.  Not remembering this I had in that time thrown the car keys at my friends because they were cold and needed to get warm. That was about the only rational thought that anyone had all night.  They were now sitting in the car and I approached it with an intriguing curiosity.  I passed the car and looked again to the sky.  It spoke to me.  When I finally did approach the car I opted for the passenger side as my best friend was in the drivers seat and his goofy faces and hysterically fast moving manner was pissing me off.  ", "I had already begun talking the vitamin C bottle and communicating with it.  It kept telling me to eat them so I was sucking them down one after another.  I finished off half of a very big bottle quite easily.  Approaching Tiff's side I realized that I needed help, why I don't know.  They had to open the door for me, though, because I could not figure it out, what it was.  They opened it and I still didn't know if I wanted to get in or not.  What followed was a ravingly lunatic conversation consisting mostly of the word 'fuck.'  I was yelling at my best friend because he would yell at me to get in the fucking car and I would almost decide to when I would yell at him to shut up and he would.  Then he would turn and yell again and betray me so I always ended up walking away and talking to the stars again.  ", "Then, one time, I went over to his side.  I looked at his face and he turned and smiled at me and he was satan.  He had been banging his head on the window and had two lumps where horns would be, so they were there as were the fangs dripping blood and the fire in his eyes and also the music.  At one point before I had looked at him sitting among some rocks that appeared to me as piles of dead and bald bodies committing very sinful acts of the flesh.  In his shirt stripes when he became satan were those bodies again, fucking like mad.  Well, I was not scared of this, but actually quite aroused and intrigued and also it set me into a stir of comedy.  I felt associated in no way to either one of these people at this point.  My ex had become a mannequin with a flapping jaw at one point and was now a dripping mushroom candle that I had an amazing urge to 'hop' on top of.  She was dripping all over herself like a candle.  My friend had taken a bag of her belongings and thrown them all over the place.  He was also throwing weeks old tortillas at me with vengeance and I was a raving lunatic.  I could have easily been committed as all of us could have.  ", "I looked up to the trees to escape the lunacy of the other two (I felt sane while they weren't, even though I was actually worse) and I saw a very sexy, feminine tree and my mind took note of it as it stretched high above me, higher and higher.  Then I looked to her right and there was a small and dumpy pine tree that was very angry at my attempts to hit on his wife.  I didn't want a barroom brawl, so I walked away and told him that he had had one too many.  Then as I returned to the car a cop pulled up along side the passenger side where I was standing.  He immediately rushed us and accused us of being drunk.  There was stuff thrown all over around the car and Tiff had been nibbling on the tortillas and making a paste out of it and putting it on the seat.  When he accused us I retorted loudly that we hadn't been drinking, as we hadn't.  He asked us then why he smelled it so strongly.  As he looked in the rear windows with his flashlight I made a small attempt to bite his neck but the noise of it caught his attention too quickly and his gaze returned, calming me down.  He told us that park hours were over and that we should leave.  ", "A sense of rationality did overcome me at that point and I opened the door, got in and we drove off.  Driving up to Tiff's house I looked at my skin and saw the ivy crawling all over it. The trees outside were changing colors and the road was swimming away from us.  We made it safely, I don't know how, and went up to Tiff's very happy room.  I looked into the mirror and saw my face melting everywhere.  Lucky that I was in Tiff's home as it was my second home for the previous year and a half.  I could move my face like it was clay and all of her feminine condiments were swimming atop the counter.  They were ebbing like the ocean.  I went into her room and sat on the floor.  Ian was on the bed hoping for nothing more but to be sane again.  For some reason it didn't hit me that anything out of the ordinary was happening.  I was playing with Tiff's miniature poodle and it was jumping to and fro leaving itself all over my hands.  The floor was ebbing like water and I had the most tremendous sense of comfort and warmth.  ", "I was looking into Tiff's eyes and realizing what children we had been for so long, fighting with each other and such.  I knew then that I loved her perfectly and beautifully.  She was looking at me with the same warmth.  Ian, not feeling very at home, was almost crying.  I had him sit next to me on the floor and I just held him.  I held him and soon Tiff crawled up under an arm.  I felt so much love and I never wanted it to end.  I felt as though I would have been happy sitting in that room forever just holding them.  They felt like the warmest family that I had ever had.  I didn't ever want to leave and I almost started crying because I knew it would.  I was holding Ian when I realized that I could easily kiss him romantically, that I was sexually attracted to him.  That was the start of my acknowledgment of my bisexuality.  It was so amazing.  I felt at home and complete for the first time in my life.  I was watching the walls melt all around me and it was so amazing.  At that point it was around three in the morning.  ", "We drove around and looked for Julia after that because we did realize that she could have gone anywhere if she had lost her mind relatively as badly as we had.  We couldn't find her and assumed that she had found her home because we had, even though she had no one else there.  We were still tripping hard and went back to Tiff's to cool down.  We watched the walls melt until around six in the morning when Ian decided that he needed to go home.  I watched the trees all around me growing and moving and knew that I was too afraid to be alone.  Tiff stayed at my house and the only thing that could comfort my eyes to sleep, around nine a.m., was thinking about vanilla frozen yogurt.   I slept for a while and woke up still tripping hours later.  I had flashbacks very strongly for a long, long time.  In fact, I still do at night when we are on roads in a car or when I am typing at my computer, especially with music.  Whatever I took was beautiful, I am shrooming again this weekend.  I was blown away.  I highly suggest going insane for a night, it brought me into perspective.  I felt for a long time as if my life was simply building to that point and then I finally hit it, I finally was real.  Now I am whole.  It completed something in me that is unexplainable.  It made me realize that I had never matured past seven years old and at that point I went through every stage of maturing that there is.  ", "I am an asthmatic, so I had never tried pot before, although being interested in drugs since I was a child, I had tried mushrooms 3 times before. I was low on cash so I only chipped in for 1/16th of an once, and was not expecting much of a trip. We all ate our mushrooms, put on some music and waited for them to kick in. Many of my friends are heavy pot users, and began to pass a bong around, I am a very infrequent user. I proceeded to smoke for about 20min with them, and was in the middle of complaining about the poor quality of the mushrooms when the table I was looking at started to bend in the middle. I took this as a sign and shutup. In my past experiences with mushrooms, I found a connection to myself that is normally absent, and a lack of fear (social fear). The trip lasted for about 3 hours, and was nothing profound. I attribute this to the amount of pot I smoked. Toward the end of the trip, I became too stoned to finish the hit I was taking at the time and started to freak.!", "I was able to calm myself down, but not before looking a little too gone to my friends. Many people smoke pot to aid potency of mushrooms, not I. I do not think I will ever smoke and trip at the same time again, as I was too baked too apreciate the inner connections gained by ingesting mushrooms. I had never even come anywhere close to freaking out before that night, and I suggest to others that they be very carefull with pot and mushrooms.", "I was on a holiday with a couple of friends in a forest in the Netherlands, my home country. We had bought about five grams of dried mushrooms which we planned to take in two go's. We all had experimented with mushrooms before, me twice, dried mushrooms as well, but I ate those. At the beginning of this two-week holiday, I would say three days after we had arrived we all went out into the forest and ate about 2-3 grams each (I mention this because it might be important for the effect the smoking of the mushrooms had on me later that week) Anyway, the trip was strong, the mushrooms potent.", "About five days later we were ready to go to sleep, already in our sleeping bags, each in a separate tent (4 blokes) and we came upon the idea of smoking a chillum with mushrooms. ", "At this time I was very relaxed, had nothing specifically to worry about in my life and felt good on the whole. This holiday had been good fun so far, it was a kind of big workshop festival, we were partaking in workshops on arts, music, writing etc. all very creative.", "So that was how I felt; no worries, no hassle, relaxed and well-rested, well fed and healthy. Mind you, we were steady users of marijuana, smoking about a gram or 2 a day so that was already in my system by the time we started smoking the mushrooms.", "The only preparations I made was preparing the Chillum and something I always did when smoking it was touch it against my forehead, breath deeply in and out a couple of times and then I would light it, as I did now. This must have been about 2 o'clock at night. Apart from the marijuana I wasn't taking anything else, no alcohol, no coffee, nothing. ", "What I experienced wasn't much. The thing I remember most clearly is that I felt a sort of pressure build up inside my head, seemingly coming from outside but then I reasoned it was probably coming from inside. It felt a bit like your head can feel just before or just after you've had or have a cold coming on. Another thing I noticed was that my perception of darkness was slightly different as I seemed to see more purplish dots in the blackness. That was basically all I felt.", "I first tripped back in 1997, my fresh mind couldn't handle it.  I loved that. So I began looking for my favorite new drug.  There was always a fresh supply of acid in the tri-state area of New England, but shrooms were rare. From my readings I found that cubensis was common to the gulf of Mexico, so I moved there.  The only problem is the bastards farmers salt their fields, preventing shroom habitation. But there's a few locations that are still intact.  I picked for an hour, came home with enough to fill up a basket ball (packed).  ", "I resided in a single-wide trailer, no building inspector had ever been there because it should have been condemned... not only for the insect/rodent habitation but the lack of carpeting, plumbing, not to mention structural damage due to years of tropical storms. I ate five or six caps while making tea out of the rest... I came up with about a gallon of high potency tea... drank a few cups... and began chugging vodka at a suicidal pace.  ", "I am sure you all know what visuals are like, mine were all that, maybe more, I didn't care.  I was staring at the wall, isolated, empty for hours, until I decided to stare at a TV.  The TV was talking about me, making fun of me... calling me a crackhead... every channel I flipped to was another commercial or show laughing at me as I sunk deeper and deeper into my mind.", "The radio was talking about me, the songs mocking me, and if I didn't listen attentively I'd swear it's announcers were threatening to kill me. I felt weak, light headed, I was dying... sure of it.  I couldn't call anyone, or find any help. I was killing myself with my mind.  Everyone was mine, everything was mine, and I didn't know what to do.  Friends would come in my house, they had no names no faces, they were my pawns.... mine.", "I danced to the music of my life, until I lost all knowledge of myself, my ego, vision, all faded to black.  I awoke to myself on top of a three story mall just before sunrise, alone, naked, un-aware of what I had done in the hours past. ", "There was no ladder up, I wonder if I just flew up there to this day.  The climb down was impossible, either I had to wait for help (and with no clothes in sight I would go to jail) or I could try to get myself down with assistance of cement architecture. I fell two flights down onto the concrete; I knew my leg was broken, but I had a bigger problem at the moment; naked and in a parking lot that would soon be filled with families shopping away.  ", "I crawled toward my trailer.  A few feet along the way I found my pants, fifty feet later my shirt, and later my shoes that wouldn't fit on my broken and swollen ankles.  I found a stool for a cane, and slowly gimped across the highway.", "The only thing I could think of on the roof was 'I'm naked and fearless.'", "Night before New Years eve, and me and 5 friends decide to go for a nice trip.", "We all dropped at our friends house at about 10pm, in the middle of a party. We all dropped somewhere between 1g and 1.5g of dried mushrooms. I didn't notice anything happening by 10:30, so me and a friend decided to do everything that was left. I'm not exactly sure how much it was, but it was about the same as what I had taken at 10. By 11pm I was starting to feel the initial effects, mostly just an unexplainable feeling that something 'big' was about to happen. Like the feeling I get outside just before a huge storm. Everyone else left for a bar at about this time, leaving me and my 5 friends alone.", "In the next hour my storm broke. I should mention that this was only my second time trying any drug other than pot, and it was at least 2x the shrooms that I did the first time I tried them.", "By 12am I was well and truely tripping. It was far beyond anything I experienced my first time, nearly 9 months earlier. We (everyone on shrooms) were all sitting in a circle in my friend's living room, talking and sharing what was happening to each of us. I didn't share too much, as I was barely conscious at times. I remember listening to my friends talk about trees, colors, dogs. I kept laughing, and each time I started laughing I would stop to find myself laying on the floor with my friends lauging at me. I decided to go hide in the corner, beside a little tree that looked peaceful to me.", "I can't say what time it was, as I had lost all concept of it by now, but eventually we all decided to go downstairs and listen to a CD my friend had brought with some trippy music on it. We went downstairs, but most of the guys couldn't stop talking or laughing, so they abandoned the music and went up stairs. I was the last person in the room, and I remember trying to walk towards the stairs but I kept forgetting why it was I wanted to go to them. So I just stood there with my head back and my eyes closed.", "While I stood there, I began to notice the clouds and blobs I could see with my eyes closed begin to take on definate shapes. Colorful and intricate fractals started to appear and 'dance' to the music. I was amazed at the power of my mind to create these things that my computer struggled to produce. I watched with awe as the fractals moved and zoomed in to reveal new and wonderful shapes. I couldn't control what I was seeing, but that didn't bother me at all. About this time a few of the guys came downstairs and found me laying on the floor with my eyes closed (note that I don't actually remember how I got there). They tried to bring me upstairs, and I tried to tell them to just leave me. I couldn't talk. One or two words would come out and suddenly the sentence would change and another one or two words of a different thought would come out. I remember KNOWING that it was because I was only partially in this world and this reality. Eventually the guys just decided to leave me down there, with the music.", "With my eyes closed and the fractals dancing to the music, I hit what I can only describe as the peak of the experience. Suddenly the music faded away almost to infinity, until I could only barely hear it. The fractals dissapeared from my view and I was floating in an empty void. Remembering back on it, I couldn't even feel my body. I couldn't remember life, being alive, or the concept of existence. I just WAS. Presently I understood that the blackness I was 'seeing' was an empty sky. I waited for what seemed an eternity as blue and red 'stars' appeared in the blackness to keep me company. The sky filled with these stars and a blue cloudy mist that looked much like the Milky Way on a dark summer night. In an instant I could feel myself again, but not where I once remembered being. I was laying on a bed of soft grass. My arms were spread out to each side of me. Above, and around me, statues appeared. They looked like the kind of statues you would see in a church, with serene faces and hands against their chests in prayer. They were all positioned around me in a circle, and seemed to be looking down at me. Suddenly the stars in the sky exploded in showers of red and blue dots, much like fireworks do. As the exploding stars faded from existence, so did the rest of the world. I was, for the moment, back in reality staring at my friends basement ceiling.", "I started to get a little depressed about losing the vision I had just been treated to, so I decided to go upstairs. Everyone was watching TV, so I just layed down in front of the TV and tried to enjoy the rest of the night. I didn't have any more visions, but I kept slipping in and out of reality. I remember gasping for breath for no other reason than being able to.", "The rest of the night, and my trip, was extremely enjoyable. I woke up the next morning feeling great (despite sleeping on the floor) and can honestly say the experience has changed my life for the better.", "there are just not enough words to describe the trip that i had with mushrooms, trying to put it in words would be to tell only a small part of the trip. These mushrooms are found in the state of veracruz, mexico, the city is xico a place near xalapa (capital of veracruz) they are commonly called 'pajaros' and ' san isidros' . the pajaros have a cone shaped form and are of a kind gold color when they are mature, the spores are dark purple. the san isidros are bigger and flatter, they are yellow with white at the ends, the spores are more or less the same color of pajaros. Both are found in cow manure and need first rain and then sun. ", "i had this experience away from the city in open fields, with a great desire to walk and the places called me to recieve wisdom. i think that you dont need anything else(marihuana, xtc, lsd, etc.) the experience is totally personal. I went with a friend and after eating  5 pajaros we started talking (after about half an hour, we hadnt eaten in all day) and feeling a bit repelled with the artificial things we had (i.e. bottle of water, clothes, shoes,etc.) for a while we took out our shirts  and felt totally free!!! when we were on pajaros we ate about 7 san isidros, the effect of the first mushrooms went away (i dont know the exact time, and it wont really matter to you if you try them) after about another half hour the san isidros came to us... we didnt talk for about six hours i guess and just tried to listen and recieve what the mushroom told us (not with words but with pure feelings) its trully amazing how in peace you feel, you dont need food, words, tv, cds, anything!!!! when we were thirsty we found a river when we felt the sun bothering us we found a tree, she gave us everything. we felt nature, the earth was breathing, the sounds were clearer (and understandable!!!). ", "if you try it, do it in peace with yourself and the mushroom (specially with her!!!), and eat just the ones you find just walkin, dont search too much, theyll find you... once you are in them eat carefully because theyll have effect till later and theres no turning back. she will punish you if you dont have her respect, its like a mother, in fact here in mexico we call them mother mushroom and grandfather peyote. i think thats all i have to say... when you do it (if you do it) try to leave words behind, dont talk to your friends (if you are with any, it would be better by yourself but not the first time) and let nature pass her wisdom to you. i think this are things that change your life for ever, do not try it too much, i think that with one (at most two) times a year it is enough. ive tried several chemicals and none will do the same (lsd, xtc, ketamine) and dont use marihuana ( i didnt do it but believe you are just perfect with mushrooms alone).", "just try to learn, it is not a recreational thing... let all things that were not natural aside (language, radios, etc.) and feel a complete divine experience.", "ps a funny thing is that cows know when you are on mushrroms, i cant explain it but they stare at you, even when the effect has 'gone' (because it never goes completely away) :) i think they know you have eaten mushrooms they 'make'", "Recently, I moved into my own apartment in a quiet neighbourhood with lots of trees.  It was a sunny Saturday afternoon and I planned to do nothing but just enjoy the place after two weeks of unpacking and painting.  Having tried shrooms twice previously, I enjoyed them immensely and found I had quite the affinity for them (or them for me).  It seemed like a perfect time to finish off some remaining shrooms I had, as I'd heard that tripping could be particularly pleasant on a sunny days.  It also seemed like a good time to try tripping on my own, and given the serene atmosphere I was only slightly uncomfortable with this.  I'm not sure of the exact dose, but I estimate about 1 gram.  I thought it would be a mild trip, so I was not to be disappointed.  As you shall see, I will never look at houseplants in quite the same way again....", "The effects came in an exciting rush after only about twenty minutes.  Perhaps I'm unusual in that I actually enjoy the earthy taste of dried mushrooms.  I could still taste them when the geometric patterns started to appear in the shady parts of the room.  Sunlight was beaming through the living room window and patterns of light were bouncing onto the walls from various shiny objects in the room.  These patterns resolved into the faces of Aztec gods.  I was listening to the potent music of Dead Can Dance, the voices guiding the patterns into sensual dances.  My grandfather's old clock, vaguely bird-shaped, seemed to want to fly off the wall, pinned down somehow by its swinging pendulum.   Mesmerized by this, I melted into the sofa where I sat and relaxed into a state of bliss.", "At some point I noticed that my head seemed to be lolling to the left without my conscious control. Perplexed, I found that I could not keep my head centered without effort.  Eventually I let my head turn, and in doing so my eyes immediately came to rest on a large cactus I had placed on the coffee table beside the sofa.  An amusing thought came to me that it was trying to get my attention, so I slid down to the end of the sofa - and out of the direct sun - to see what the cactus wanted.  I felt like I had just noticed for the first time someone who'd always been there.  I cooed to her a bit, then mentally asked what she wanted.  Just then I noticed, almost to an exaggerated degree, how cold and dark it was at that spot.  This seemed to me like an explicit request...the cactus wanted to be moved closer to the window and bask in the direct sun!  Without hesitation I lugged her (all 50 pounds) into the light and sat down with my arms around the pot.  For what seemed like hours I sat with her, fascinated by her thorns and sturdy limbs, carefully brushing off dust and even singing to her (which it seemed she also requested).  I sensed that she was very ancient, and she reminded me that I too was ancient.", "I was glad that I was alone, as the presence of others would have distracted me from hearing messages from my plants...now I can't wait to try shrooms this summer in the wilderness somewhere.", "After, I spent another eternity sprawled out on the floor in the sun.  The sun raining through my eyelids and the sound of birds outside made me feel like I was on the floor of an immense forest.  Later, I became caught in front of the bathroom mirror by the absolute strangeness of my face.  Luckily I had come down quite a bit by then, or I fear I might have spent the whole trip examining my face.  While looking into my eyes, I understood why my face was arranged the way it is, in order to bring certain senses to the fore.  I think I may also have contacted a dormant personality within me, one which seemed like he could have lived a few centuries ago, somewhere in Europe.  He was extremely arrogant but charming, and I could see that some of his traits were expressed in me now, though to a milder degree.  I can only speculate.", "Past lives and communication with the plant world...these were more than I expected, but I was grateful for the experience.  Each time I've tried mushrooms has been in a completely different environment.  I'm amazed at the variety of experiences that can result.  I feel like I could use them both for simple pleasure/recreation and for some serious personal exploration.  I have gotten so much of them already after only three trips at relatively low doses, that I'm almost afraid to increase the dose and have an even more intense experience to absorb.  I see immense potential.  I could say 'where have these mushrooms been all my life?' but I know that only now am I ready for them.", "I've concluded, even from my limited experience, that hallucinogenic substances do not 'do' anything to you, other than facilitate the opening of a gate to the wider world around us.  It depends on each individual how far beyond the gate they will explore and how much they will bring back when the gate creeps shut again.  I also think it's possible to wedge the gate open a little, in order to draw on an expanded perspective in our everyday lives.", "Me and a friend of mine decided that after 2 unsuccesful experiences with shrooms (we didnt trip at all, probably fake), that we would give it another shot. After virtually NO preparation, and NO idea what was about to happen to us, we chomped them down raw.  Everyone says these things are horrible tasting, but I was so eager to trip, i didnt even notice the taste.", "Right after that, I decided to go chill in some of my friends suitemats rooms, while he went and showered. About 15 min. after ingestion, i started to feel the effects. It wasn't too different from what i had expected. The commmercial for SSX snowbaording came on, and everything started to look really really cool. Then i ventured into another room where there were a few guys sitting around listening to dave matthews with all the lights off and a couple black lights going. I was having the time of my life!", "After staring into the mirror for a while, i realized that it was actually another dimension that i could never reach, and instead of pondering how to actually be a part of this world, i walked away from it. Then i realized my friend was still in the shower, so i wnet to check on him. I yelled out his name, with no response. The showers had low enough walls to glance over, so i went over there and peeked in. He looked at me and started pointing out all the faces he was seeing in the marble walls. I told him to hurry up so we could go experience this new world together.", "After he got out of the shower, we spent about another 45 min. in the dorms just looking at everything, and playing with objects we found lying around the room. At this point we were both in a completely physical world without a care at all. Then we made the mistake of playing out the plans we had for the evening, which was venturing out to find a party, since we heard the night before that there was supposed to be a black light party. So off we went, with about 12 non-tripping people, only about 3 of which we were actually cool with. Things started to fall apart once we got to the street where the party was happening. By this time, I was convinced by two others that I was closer to god than anybody else on the street, which blew my mind.", "My tripping friend and I had started to grow distant, not speaking to each other as much. Things really got nasty though when someone at the party yelled out that they were checking ID's at the door. For some reason, This became a life and death situation to me...like they would spot me, come check my ID and notice the enormous size of my pupils. So i bitched and moaned until i got someone to take me back to the dorms...my friend wanted to leave as well. We had to split up to get back, because we were freaking each other out, not making sense and going through intense mood swings.", "So finally i got back to the dorms, and was cooling down, until some moron decided he knew how to handle someone on a bad trip. I dont remember much about the conversation, but the two people in the room with me became these entities that i can now only describe as what i saw as disciples of some highly powerful god. I was almost positive that their god was the christian god. One of them left to go check on my friend, who i didnt realize even existed anymore...it was very hard for me to grasp the fact that he wasnt in the same building as me but i WOULD see him again.", "Anyways, this is dragging out, so im going to pick up the pace. Another guy came down, one who i was actually good friends with, but didnt seem to know at the time. He and the other person (the diciple) began to argue about what i later found out was just a discussion about christianity. To me however, they were members of different religious sects, who were sent by thier respective gods to recruit me for purposes which i did not know. ", "Right in the middle of all this, the second 'disciple' came running back in to the room telling me that my friend (the tripping guy) was looking for me, and he was throwing up. We rushed upstairs and he was sitting in his room. After this, everyone began to argue about what was to be done. My friend was freaking out about dying and all that good stuff, and i was just trying to wait out my trip, which at this point was absolutely no fun anymore.", "As i began to calm down, it felt as if i was descending into my own death, that at the end of this trip, i would cease to exist...but i wanted to wait it out until the bitter end. This hope was shattered when i got the notion that my friend was going to kill me. We both said the strangest things that night, which would make for a killer movie, but anyways, it only got scarier.", "After the trip was FINALLY done, we began to speak again, and relive our experiences. We were apart for about 2 good hours, in which time we both had lots of strange revelations. Shrooms are good, but I have leared not to try and venture out again until im sure im ready.", "One of my friends (he doesn't do drugs) told me that one of his friends were selling mushrooms and since I've never done them before I decided to try them. So I bought an eighth (3.5 grams), and made a gram worth of tea (to experiment).After ingesting that, I went over to a friends house. I wasn't feeling any sort of buzz or anything yet, but I hade this uncontrollable urge to laugh. And right when I reached my friends house, This fat kid and the friend that got me the mush called out my name so I went over there laughing my ass off. I then took a handful of shrooms and stuffed them in my mouth, chewing on them for about 20 minutes. We were walking along in the sun to go to the skate park when it hit me. I was in the desert. It was so sunny out that the ground gave a mirage, and I kept saying to my friends :'Its like a re-occurring nightmare!!!!' because I was starring at the sidewalk when I noticed that every sidewalk brick was exactly the same and I thought that it would never end.", "And then we were in the shade and I said 'we're in the dark side, now.' And it was like life had two sides, the good side and the bad side. I thought that I found out the meaning of life, and I just became so happy. And that's where the dark side came in....", "We ended up at my friends house, cause he had to get supper. I was getting paranoid and decided to stay outside while he went in. My mistake, I should've went inside. Cause next thing I knew, the zoomers were kicking in and I just sat on the steps, motionless for fifteen minutes. And then the ground started moving. It was moving closer and closer to me. And then, out of nowhere a giant blob thing came out of the ground and tried to hit me, so I stomped on the ground and it disappeared. then my friend came out. i told him about it and I said to the ground ' We'll meet again before the nights over, I can guarantee you that...'", "And then I ate another handful as we walked to the skate park. My friend looked like a skeleton, the sun was smiling at me and, at the skate park, the wall ridge was burping! The sky was a hologram, the ground was moving again, this one kid looked like a goblin, another kid looked like the sun, cause he had a yellow mo-hawk. And I was just so happy that I felt like crying the whole night. And then whenever I touched a smoke, it turned wet automatically and I thought it was magic, but I guess I was just sweating a lot. Then they kicked in again. just out of nowhere, a yellow blob that I thought was a rabbit ran in front of me. I chased it.", "By the end of the night, the mushrooms changed me. I seen stuff differently after that. I was more happier, artistic and a better person. One of my friends was gonna throw a pop bottle at a nerd, and I usually would too, but this time, I said, 'Wait! How would you like it if I had done that to you?' And he thought about it and dropped the bottle.", "If it wasn't for those mushrooms, I wouldn't be happy. But now, thanks to them I am feeling greater than ever, am happy, peaceful and very thankful.", "At the time, I was fairly confident, over-confident actually, with the use of psilocybin mushrooms. Judging from my past experiences and my young age (19) I would have considered myself a moderately experienced drug user. Up until that time, I had engaged in smoking large quantities of sensimilla, mucho booze, valiums, vicadin, nitrous oxide, msa, shrooms and combining most of the above. Moderately experienced  drug user, relatively inexperienced tripper. Now, back to my story...the week before two of my co-workers and I purchased a large amount of the said fungi from a lecherous drug dealer. I had eaten about 7 grams (1/4 of an ounce) that night, and another night that week. ", "The mood at work had taken on a savage glow. The carnival was in town that week, which was held one city block away from the grocery store where us villains took up employment. Things were hectic, we were being overworked and coming to work stoned wasn't cutting it. So the plans were made - that night we agreed that after getting off work at closing, we would eat the rest of the shrooms in an attempt to relieve our troubled young minds. But I wasn't content to wait an 8 hour work day to trip while I had a 1/2 ounce of shrooms on hand, so before work I got stoned and ate a couple caps. About another hour into work I ingested some more and so on throughout the day. Yes, there were some minor instances of losing control - sometime around dusk I knocked over the display of multi-colored balls, sending them flying in every direction. Indeed, a tripper's nightmare. ", "After work we gathered in the back of my friend's campershell in the parking lot. I had a little more than a 1/4 ounce left, which I promptly ate. We smoked a whole lotta dope and then started walking to the bright lights of the fair. The scene was reminiscent of Hunter Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Were we prepared to buy our tickets and ride bracelet with a head full of psilocybin?", "It was after we had made the purchases, thankfully, when it started to get on top of me. The grass would turn into grass and snakes, which was fun. We got on one of the rides where you sit in the swing connected to a chain and you fly through the air. I started to feel the fear as the drug got a tighter grip, the menacing tones cascading off the flourescent lights. The tweaking carny grinning at me evilly put me on edge. There was too much going on, my body was too worn down and too dosed to reason logically. But I did control myself, even when the satanic sounding music of the ride filled the summer air. ", "This was more than a bad trip, it may have been a divine lesson. It was all I could do to keep my body from jumping to my death off the ride, swinging and swinging, music reaching crescendo after horrifying crescendo. I was crying, my whole life went before me and I may have been closer to the accurate introspective truths of myself as I have ever been. And then it stopped and I somehow managed to get out of the seatbelt, which probably is there for mushroom gobbling suicidal freaks such as myself. The paranoia had crept over me in a wave and broke on me when one of my friends mentioned something about security and the words he used, 'they will win,' reverberated through my brain the rest of the night. Stangely, I persevered still and we went to the house of mirrors. For the 5 minutes I was in there I felt sure I was sucked into helpless, inescapable oblivion. But still I pulled it off without making a scene. ", "By this time, despite my performance, I had to escape from this madness. Going into detail as far as visuals is concerned will only prolong this extended piece. But as I said goodbye to my friends and tried to find my way out, I entered a journey that seemed to touch on all corners of the universe. I had been to these fairgrounds many, many times before and I knew where the exit was. It took me three hours to get outside the gate. As I walked down the lane inside the fair, the music blaring from the loudspeakers would change with the scenery and variety of people. Every time the last type of music would fade out and the new one started, I felt as if I was stepping through a curtain into a different time and place. I was truly experiencing time/space travel for an extended period of time. When I finally got back to my car, the main street on which I was parked was filled with sirens, junkie bums and drunks. The police were in the process of arresting someone right there. Having no control over my limbs, I started driving. Tension, anxiety and the deflation of my ego from all that self-introspection led to a sort of cardiac arrest. I threw all my drug paraphernalia into the street, nearly killing 3 pedestrians and many others on the way home. Since then I have been straight from all drugs. I learned a valuable lesson and had more than my share of psychedelic experiences which still affect me down to this very day. Kids, a message to you - think twice.", "The first thing I remember was that I was in a very large kingdom in the sky.  I began to walk forward as if I was beginning a judgement. Then I came upon a large blinding light as if it was God. I was then judged for what I don't know. It seemed to take forever and I soon began to fall to what was earth. I was then confronted by a friend who was talking to me in a language I don't really understand. I was surrounded by hills and they were filled with poles of some sort. I was somehow broken away and began starting a conversation with a tree. It talked in the same language that my friend Corey was speaking, then it suddenly started to disintegrate and I was beginning to fall in a dark hole. I was told by my friend Keith that was when I woke up. It was 12:00 at night and there had been reports by the police for trespassing on private property (keep in mind that this last section was when I regained my ability to control myself)and that was all I remember... ", "Dear fellow trippers, here's a story from a Dutch ex-psychonaut about a time I took some mushrooms with some friends of mine two years ago.", "At the time I was 20 years old and had done mushrooms many times.  I was smoking pot since I was 14, had done coke, speed, XTC and LSD before so I was used doing drugs.  I always thought that I couldn't get into a bad trip since I had already done mushrooms and I didn't had any psychic problems.", "Me, John, Frank and Peter had known each other about three years from school and all of us were experienced with mushrooms. We ate the mushrooms and started to wait for the effect. It took half an hour before we felt something. The fun began! During this whole trip we smoked a joint like every 20 minutes, maybe this was a little too much.", "We went upstairs and started listening to music and playing Tombraider 2 on the computer. We were really IN the game and I heard the sound of a storm that was in the game as if it was in my head. I asked if my friends had the same and they answered that they had the same! We laughed and were surprised that those effects were the same with all of us. We kept on playing (while the trip became stronger) untill we tried something else on the computer.", "Windows 95 has a screensaver called 'Labyrinth'. In the options menu you can choose the texture of the walls, grounds and ceilings of the Labyrinth. We chose some kind of psychadelic texture with many bright coloured patterns. We activated the screensaver en looked at it with our nose against the monitor with some acid music on the background. That was really cool and we felt as if we were IN the Labyrinth. Al those flashing patterns were really 'mindraping' as we called it then and after a while we all had enough of it, it was too much for our tripping brains.", "We then begun with 'Warcraft', an old strategy game. While we were playing frank was lying on the bed not saying anything. Then the volume of the music changed and I looked up to see how that was possible. I asked Frank if he was changing the volume but he said: 'no, why  are you fucking with me?!'. I knew that he must have chanced it but because he said no, I didn't want to argue and distort my trip so I let it go. After a while I asked him if he was feeling alright and he didn't really answer, he was mumbling something and it looked as if he was sleeping. (Later he told me that he was felt like he was dreaming and that it was like nothing changed and he couldn't get out of that dream, it was as if time stood still. He didn't remember that he was tripping on mushrooms and if I had known that I could have told him and that would have helped him but that didn't came up to me that time.) ", "I hoped everything would be alright with him, I didn't want any stress, afraid of my trip being influenced by his 'bad trip', so I payed not too much attention on his state of mind. Suddenly I heard a loud BANG and we all turned around to see what it was. It seemed that it was the remote controll that hit one of my speakers. I asked Frank if he threw the remote against my speaker but he said no and looked at me in a strange way. I looked at Peter and we both knew this wasn't going well.", "We all acted as if it didn't happen, maybe we hoped that it didn't happen. ", "I sligthly began to panic because I knew Frank was heaving a really bad trip and I wasn't sure what he was going to do. (I have always been afraid of unpredictable people.) I already saw myself sleeping while Frank was wandering around my house, having his bad trip and do.....whatever. Mayby he'll burn down the house or kill me, those kind of things came in my mind and I really started to panic.", "We all sat there and sometimes Frank said strange and scary things and he was looking as if the devil posessed him wich scared me and Peter. We looked at eachother and both knew this trip was going REALLY bad!!! The vibes in my room were not good so I deceided to go downstairs with Frank, maybe that would help. Downstairs my cats looked at me as if they knew I was really fucked up in the head, but that could also be my imagination. We watched some tv, hoping that there was something on that would relax our minds but everything was too impressive. My brain was getting tired of all those impressions on tv so we deceided to go outside and smoke a sigarette. It was raining and Frank said something about a leek in the rainpipe and that I had to fix it. He said it in a way as if he was mad and became more and more scared! I deceided to go upstairs with the others.", "When we got in the room all of the sudden I didn't hear anything, a few seconds later I couldnt see anything accept for a distorted image similar to the screensaver wich we looked at  (maybe that hadn't been such a good idea). All of my bodyfunctions started to stop and I knew I was standing but couldn't see anything or even think and I felt myself falling. Peter got up quickly and catched me while I was falling and lifted me up and laid me down on my bed. When he catched me it was like I had no weight, as if was as heavy as a feather. (Later he said he had that experience too before I had even told him about that! I do believe there can be some kind of telepathy in a group during a trip, maybe because all of your minds are in the same 'wavelength'.)", "From that point I could hardly talk or move, I could only watch everything around me while laying on my bed. Peter told me later that I looked lika a zombie and that's exactly how I was feeling at that moment. After a while we went downstairs, seeking a more comfortable area with better vibes. We felt as if the room upstairs had 'bad vibes' and especially the computer wich seemed really evil to us at that moment.  Downstairs we watched some tv while I was stressing more and more. I asked Peter to call the ambulance because I didn't know what else to do. I really wanted my trip to end and I didn't saw any other way. Fortunally he told me that if we waited everything problabbu would be alright so we all continued there sitting and flipping. ", "Suddenly Frank said: 'I was really having a bad trip' and I knew instantly that he was out of his trip. I felt a huge relief because everything was now going to be alright and all my stress dissapeared. We went outside and were amazed about what just had happened. We felt very close to eachother and hugged, happy that the trip was over. We couldn't stop to talk about it and repeating everything that happened.", "Now you might ask yourself, 'what happened to John?' Well, he didn't say much that night and was just feeling sick but not in a bad trip like us. I'm really happy that Peter didn't call the ambulance when I asked him to because my whole neighbourhood would have noticed when it would arrive at 3.00 pm. Then I would have to explain to my parents what happened and problably pay for all the medical costs too.", "By then I tought that I would never do mushrooms again but later I tried it one more time with Peter. We had a bad trip again (not as bad as this one) and since then I have never touched any hallucinating drugs.", "What I have learned from this? By now I can say that I didn't want to had missed it but at that moment I wanted it to go away more than anything else in my life. I thought it couldn't happen to me but now I know that you can never say that it's save. Ther are times that I want to do LSD or muschrooms again but I'm too afraid that it would go wrong, so I'll just stay with weed.", "(By the way, I'm from Holland so that's why this story is written so bad, SORRY!)", "This isn't about the first time I shroomed.  That was when it wasn't really mushroom season and they were weak.  But my first times did prepare me for what to expect and let me know how much would be too much.  ", "I live in Southern Oregon, and we've got mushrooms, boy-howdy.  Although there are many different kinds of good shrooms, people only sell one kind here.  I don't know what they are called, but they have red caps and white stems.  Anyway, I fried on acid twice and had minor shroom trips like 5 times, and let me tell you now:  DON'T EAT THE WHOLE EIGHTH YOUR FIRST TIME!  ", "Shrooms are a very manipulative thing.  If you don't know what's going on, when you lose reality, it can be very scary the first time.  Then that builds on itself, and your whole trip becomes, 'What did I just do/say that I don't know I did/said?'  'Did that sound stupid?'  'Is everyone looking at me?  Do I look bad?'  And the dreaded 'How long was I gone?!'  Etc., etc....", "This is about the time I REALLY fried on an eighth I split with my friend Mary, and her friend I had just met that was going to fry off a half-eighth too.  It was going to be her first time.  I don't remember her name, so I'll call her Jennifer.  She really wanted to fry but was kinda afraid.  We told her all about our times, and what acid was like, and how they compare.  She got really into it and couldn't wait.  We were going to Mary's house.  Her two step-brothers and real brother were going to be there, but they were cool, and except for her real brother, had all shroomed a lot before too.  Jennifer was just meeting them for the first time too.  We ate our half-eighths when leaving Jennifer's, and it took about 15 minutes to get to Mary's from there.  We went out to her patio and just started kicking back, waiting for the shrooms to kick in.  We knew it was happening cuz everything was getting really, really FUNNY.   Something would be funny for 5 min., and it compounded and everything that happend during that 5 min. was funny too, so we'd laugh harder and harder.", "And then:  all of o sudden we all just stopped laughing, and took a deep breath and looked up.  The evening summer sky was the most breathtaking shades of purple and blue and pink.  The clouds were 3D.  Mary had a trampoline, and we all jumped on it.  When we stopped jumping our brains felt like they still were inside our skull.  We thought that was hil-diddly-arious.  Then we got in my car.  I can tell when I'm too fried to drive, and at this early point, I was ok.  We went right down the street to a supermarket to watch people.  Not just any people--SOBER PEOPLE.  It was totally beyond us to remember or feel sober.  There was a sale sign for beef, and we kept saying the word over and over.  It sounded so funny to us.  Then they dared me to go in the store and get something to drink.  Walking down the aisles, my body felt foreign, like I was an alien who stole a body to live in.  I had to fight with all my reduced mental strength not to laugh at everything and everybody.  I felt like everyone was staring at me.  I got through the line without incident, and was very proud of myself for doing so.  I felt like I had taken a huge step in my development as a human being.", "When we got back to Mary's, she wanted to get high.  Her brothers loaded a huge bong of green bud.  Our fry had pretty much been coming down for a while then, so I felt ok to do so.  We were passing the bong hose, and then all of a sudden I just knew I was DONE.  No more for me.  Jennifer seemed to have been really following my lead in the house as far as how to act and stuff, so she said she was done too.  Even when I would sit in her brothers' room and just get high - I don't know them very well - I always felt self-conscious around them.  This made frying hard, because after getting stoned, we were sent back to Wonderland twice and hard and fast as before.  And we were in a room with no windows, and just some music and everyone just sitting around looking at each other.", "Mary had left to help her parents with something in the living room, and I was responsible for Jennifer's well-being.  She was even more self-conscious since she didn't know them, and I had to try to keep myself in the here & now, and her also.  And she wasn't easy.  She was fried off her rocker!  She kept asking if her head looked crooked (we had looked in a mirror earlier when we 'first' fried, and she commented she thought her jaw line was crooked).  I was almost fried out of my head too, so I kept wishing Mary would come back and save us.", "I told the boys to turn the music to something other then Pink Floyd, which they gladly and quickly did, because they could tell Jen was in trouble.  That totally changed her mood for the better.  She started laughing about stuff, but then whenever we stopped talking, she would get upset again.  Then she started talking to herself, or someone she thought was there, and laughing.  I thought maybe we could watch some South Park tapes.  Bad idea.  I couldn't keep myself from thinking that was the way the world was, and everyone outside that room was a South Park character.  I also couldn't keep a stupid smile off my face.  Every word that they said was funny.  Jen totally lost it.  When a South Park character talked, she thought they were talking to HER.  She would answer, and ask, 'What do you mean?  What are you talking about?'  And mumble some incoherent stuff she probably didn't even know she was saying.  ", "Anyway, I could not take being in that tiny windowless room anymore.  I had to leave.  I knew I needed to get Jen out of that room too, but she couldn't walk.  I felt awful for leaving her, but I couldn't take it anymore.  Before this, I kept taking small breaks to smoke a cig, or get a glass of water, and tell Mary to please hurry.  She had to do some computer repair for her parents.  She herself didn't even know how she did it.  I couldn't have.  So after I came down enough, and was starting to want to sleep, I needed to go home.  I didn't feel really comfortable driving, but it was the only way I was getting home.  I live 20 min. away from Mary's, and I was so paranoid about cops.  It was hard to concentrate on what speed I was going, and keeping it there.  That seemed to need all my attention, but I had to watch for everything else too.  But, I made it. [erowid note: It is extremely irresponsible to drive while high.  Driving is the most dangerous thing you do and pro-active plans should be made to avoid it in this situation.]", "So in my opinion, if possible, start small enough to just get a body high and fry a little harder each time.  Around here, if you can eat a whole eighth and not end up in jail or the hospital, you are a tough brave soul, the kind of person everyone talks about.  Ask a lot of questions.  I've found if the dealer says they haven't tried them, they are probably lying and the shrooms are nothing good, but they have to get rid of them.  Any dealer that's tried good ones doesn't hesitate to tell you all about how great the trip was.  And any decent dealer will try his product.", "And whatever you do, make sure you are in comfortable surroundings, with people you are comfortable with, someone you won't be embarrassed around if you start talking to invisible people."], "oxycodone": ["I have never experimented with any opiates or opioids stronger than oxycodone and hydrocodone.  But these I have much experience with.  I have dosed oxycodone about four times in my life, hydrocodone about 10, ODing on it once.  I almost always take my dope orally.  I tried administrating the drug by snorting a few times but concluded it wasn't effective, considering both hydrocodone and oxycodone come w/ about 100 mg of aspirin or tylenol per pill.  That is a lot of material to snort--hard on your nose.  I have never attempted to ingest either drug by IV.  I believe using a needle to administer opiates, opioids, and stimulants is solely a tool for addicts to make the drug more effective.  Believing myself to be no addict, I never use a needle.", "Approximately twenty minutes after ingestion the old familiar warmness, itchy, euphoric feelings set in.  The euphoric feelings began to intensify until reaching a plateau for about three hours 50 minutes after ingestion.  At this point, speech was slurred considerably, but nothing a little concentration couldn't handle, coordination was very impaired, the body is very relaxed and at peace, and small but pleasant, vertigo-like feelings were felt, however, nothing nearly as strong as 4th-plateau DXM trips or even Acid.", "On opioids, no visuals are seen nor desired to be seen.  Little interest is taken upon the world--no fascination with pretty flowers, or a blue sky; Its more of an oblivious, 'spaced out' feeling high.  Mental cloudiness is present, making thinking hard.

When completely down--a very relaxing sensation is felt through out the body--leaving you with no desire for more.", "It can be ultimately said that while acid makes you use 80% of your brain, opioids make you use 1% of it.  Opioids and Opiates truely narrow your view and interest to think about things--to sit back and just philosophize.  This is why I do not abuse these drugs.  I enjoy thinking and pondering the origins of anything from the universe to a molecule of dirt for hours on end.  But a rare change from this never hurt anybody.  Opioids are very pleasant, but not life changing and profound.  Not as spirtual--more physical and numbing.  Yet enjoyable.", "There are many things I notice w/ the recreational usage of opioids--", "~those you are close to seem even closer, I dare to say the feelings may be somewhat similiar to minute doses of E", "~the old familiar euphoric feeling you get on pain killers: pleasant drowsiness, pleasant intertia, comfortable itching, and intense, strung-out, euphoria", "~pupils don't always diliate- my pupils become very small, but seemed to blend in with the color of my eyes.", "~nearly impossible to reach orgasm until at LEAST 24 hours after heavy doses", "~the feeling of annoyance is always lurking amongst those you even dislike the least bit.  I suggest being alone or in close company of those you truely love and like.", "Anyways kids, that is my two cents.  Opioids are cool, as are Opiates, but abuse can be very dangerous and damaging.", "I'm tellin' you right now this shit is definatly just like heroin.  It has become very big on the east coast and I believe all over the country. Two pharmacy's in my area have been broken into by fiends lookin' for O.C.'s. I love them personally because they are guaranteed. I mean, if you get a bag of dope the purity is not guaranteed. Unless I'm the only one whose ever come across dishonest heroin dealers(Which I'm sure I am not). But Oxy's are always good, as long as you know what they look like. The 80 mg pills are smaller green coated pills with the letters OC on one side and the numbers 80 on the other.

BUT BE CAREFUL!!! I'm serious when i say it's as potent as a bag of dope. You can O.D. on the shit so watch it. Just use good judgement when you do them. My expierences with them have always been good but that's just me and my friends. But we can handle our shit.(With the occasional vomiting that goes along with all strong opiates of course). They come in 5mg,10 mg,20 mg,40mg,80mg,and now 160mg pills all ranging in color but they will always have OC and the milligram on them. You can usually get them in singles from someone who sells their perscription because doctors are giving them out like candy anymore. Or sometimes if you get lucky in wholesale from some shady bastard who has a pharmaceutical hookup. But watch out for these sneaky, green little bastards. They pack a powerful punch. All the dopeheads i know will trade bags for O.C.'s any day. If your fancy is more dopey, chilled out shit as compared to speed, you'll love these fuckers.

I do not reccomend this at all.  I've talked to a lot of people after the fact and those who have tried it all agree that Salvia was the most intense experience they've ever had, and believe me - some of these people are extremely hard core.", "I knew that the Salvia high was a very short one, so I allocated about an hour in my day in which I was going to try it out.  A couple friends and I went over to one of our apartments and began preperations.  Within a couple minutes the 2 foot bong was cleaned, filled with fresh water and packed.  I took a couple deep cleansing breaths, cleared my mind, lit the bowl and toked.  My first hit was fairly large, I filled my lungs with a good ammount of smoke.  I remember breathing the hit out and watching the smoke travel out my nose and down towards the floor.  Just then I started to hear a strange repetitive sound and I could feel something tugging on my body.  I handed the bong off to one of my friends and after that point things became a blur.", "My friends tell me that after about 20 seconds I did a second hit, not as large as the first.  I have no recollection of this event.  In my mind the sound and the tugging motion had transformed into me trying to escape from a never ending line of closing garage doors, all of which were closing on me.  I tried to get away from them but I couldn't move fast enough to keep ahead of them.  My friends are relativly experienced trippers, I think one of them suggested that whatever was happening I should just let it happen.", "Taking that advice, I collapsed onto the couch and let the garage doors catch up with me.  Soon I had been crushed by them, but it was okay because I was just spit out the other side.  The garage doors morphed into a rotating sprocket which spun off into oblivion.", "It was then that I noticed I was floating above a vast plane upon which there was an infinatly large branching tree structure.  If you can imagine what a family tree looks like, except take that to the largest extreme possible that is what I saw beneath me.", "I became aware of voices above me and looked up.  Above me I could see the faces of people from my lives, friends, family, people I'd only seen once or twice before in my entire life.  I somehow knew that these people were not themselves, they were just representations of higher beings from another plane of existance.  They were using images from my own mind to communicate with me in hopes that I would be more comfortable with those images than I would be with their true forms.  They explained to me that the structure I saw beneath me was the fabric of Time, that each branch was an event that caused a split in the tree.", "The concept behind this is fairly simple, imagine that for each decision you make, no matter how minute, you inadvertantly create a seperate timeline where you made that decision.  At the same time there are parallel timelines where you made some other decision.  The beings explained to me that I had become detached from the fabric of Time and that I needed to search through the timelines and collapse them all into my own personal timeline so I could return to my body.", "To acomplish this task I transformed my perception into a large zipper, which I used to collapse the timelines into a single line which become my life.  At this point I remembered that I had consumed a drug, which was why I was experiencing such strange things.  Before this point I had completely forgotten that I'd done any drugs at all.", "Once my timeline was collapsed I was able to regain some control over my body.  I discovered that I was on the couch, which seemed okay except that for some reason I wanted to be outside.  I got up and walked out the back door so I could sit on the weight bench that's on the back patio.", "At first my friends were concerned, they said that I'd just been sitting there for about 10 minutes with a glazed look on my face and that I'd been twitching and occasionaly I'd jump up and look around for something only to sit back down again.  I tried to tell them that I was okay and I just needed a breath of fresh air, but it was another 5-10 minutes before I could really communicate with them.", "My experience on Salvia was easily the most frightening thing I've ever done in my entire life.  During the course of my hallucination I was absolutly convinced that it was real, that I had to fight for my very existance.  Once I realised that I was on a drug it became an epic battle for me to expel it from my system, I didn't like it and I wanted it gone, NOW.  Having said that, I'll also say that my experience on Salvia was one of the most enlightening and self-affirming things I've ever done.  I'm fully confident that I can handle myself in any situation now.  After all, if I can reconstruct my own timeline and expel demons from my body, there really isn't anything LSD or shrooms can throw at me that I can't handle."], "tobacco": ["I'm 19 years old have been an avid user of chewing tobacco for almost six months now. I took up the habit because I wanted to give up smoking, but however I did NOT want to give up the use of nicotine. I had been looking through different sites containing information related to chew, when I came across a little tidbit that said if baking soda was added to the tin (what the container is referred to as) it would keep the tobacco fresh. This made a lot of sense to me, so I went to my pantry and added a couple pinches of baking soda to my tin and mixed it in quite well. ", "A few hours later I was craving a dip, so I then proceeded to take one. Normally, for the first little while I feel a pleasant buzz, but then after a while this no longer happens. Well, about 3 minutes after I had taken a dip, a very strong buzz started to build up. It was 5 times better than my first dip was, and felt somewhere along the lines of the buzz that accumulates when I have a few beers. This experience was quite unexpected, but otherwise pleasant, I felt very relaxed and euphoric for a good 20 minutes. I am not a cowboy or redneck by all means, but am actually an average student and I skateboard and listen to hard music. I now always add a few pinches of backing soda to my tin, for a great buzz that continues strong for about 2 months now.", "I'm writting this for two reasons 1) There's no tobacco experiences on here 2) I think that there are some misconceptions about smoking.", "The first time I tried smoking I was 15.  I had heard stories from parents and teachers about how if i tried smoking i would get sick, throw up and hate it.  I always figured this seemed reasonable, considering you're inhaling smoke and chemicals into your lungs. But one day I decided i had to see for myself. I stole a cigarette from my father who smokes about two packs a day.  ", "One day when my parents were out I went outside and light up.  I took a few puffs in my mouth to ease into it.  Then I inhaled.  As i felt the smoke go down into my chest I thought all the warnings about how smoking would get me sick should have been heeded but i didnt get sick.  I inhaled again and felt the smoke creep into my lungs but it wasn't a bad feeling, so I smoked the rest of the cigarette.  Afterward I felt good.  Not high or anything, just a good mood.", "I have smoked many times since then but I remain unaddicted.  And I think thats the correct application of nicotine and tabacco products.  Use them in moderation when you want to relaxe or ease up and it can be a rewarding, relatively harmless experience.", "I hope this can help anyone who plans on trying smoking and would like to know what to expect.", "The other night I was at my father's house watching some TV. My father doesn't know I smoke, but I usually sneak off to the bathroom and have one, because the fan in his bathroom sucks air out through the roof. ", "So there I was, on the couch, and I felt the need for a smoke, I hadn't had one in about 7 hours and normally I can't go more than one hour without having one. My father was asleep in his chair (as usual), so I got up and went to the bathroom.", "Once I got to the bathroom I closed and locked the door behind me, and turned on the fan. I looked at myself in the mirror and smiled, for I knew I was finally going to have a smoke.", "I reached into my pocket and pulled out my pack and my lighter, but to my surprise, when I opened the pack I saw that it was EMPTY!!", "I almost lost my sanity at that moment, for I couldn't just take one of my father's, because he smokes ULTRA LIGHTS and I smoke REGULARS, which is a huge difference for those of you who don't know what I am talking about.", "I was jonesing hard, and if I smoked an Ultra Light that wouldn't do anything for me, in fact it would only piss off my jones. Then I remembered I had money in my bank account, so I had to sneak out of the house, because my dad would want to know where the hell I was going at 11 o'clock at night.", "I jumped into my car and started to drive, but the problem was, I couldn't think of any 24 hour places that were nearby where I could go to buy smokes with my ATM card.", "So I drove 5 miles to a gas station, went in and asked for a pack. I started to feel relief, for I knew that I would soon be having my long-awaited smoke.", "when I opened my wallet I discovered my ATM card wasn't there!!! Panic suddenly surged through every fiber of my being when I realised I was not going to have my smoke. I left the store disappointed in the fact that I would most likely need to wait another 2 DAYS before I could have one.", "Then I started to wonder where my ATM card could be, unable to concentrate fully due to the lack of nicotine in my system. Then I had a vision of myself wearing shorts and purchasing something with my card, then I saw myself put the card in the back pocket of those shorts, instead of back in my wallet.", "And I knew exactly where those shorts were, back at my house in my bedroom, on the floor. But my house was on the complete other side of town, and I can't afford to be wasting gas like that.", "So I got back into my car and decided that it was best if I just went back to my father's house and tried to ignore my addiciton. So I started to drive, thinking about all the good times I have had with a cigarette in my hand.", "Then I noticed that I had been driving for a long time, much longer than it should have taken me to get back to my father's house. And when I looked around, the neighborhood looked familiar... NOOO! I WAS DRIVING BACK TO MY HOUSE!!!", "Needless to say, I was very upset that I had driven there without realizing it, but I figured, since I am here, I might as well get my card. So I ran in, went to my bedroom, grabbed the shorts and extracted my ATM card.", "I ran back to my car, jumped in and proceeded to haul ass back to my father's house, because he could have woken up at any minute and seen that I wasn't there, and I didn't want him to know I went all the way back to my house.", "I decided to stop off at the gas station on my way back, and I made it there in record time. I wasn't paying attention to how fast I was going, but I know I was exceeding the speed limit.", "I ran in, purchased my items, ran out, and tore the plastic off that pack faster than I have ever done before, opened the box, ripped out that metalic paper crap, pulled out a cigarette, put it in my mouth, and lit it up", "I felt such relief at finally getting my fix! Then I went back to my father's house, fully prepared with an outrageous (yet believeable) story of why I had been gone so long (thankfully, I could think straight with nicotine back in my system) and when I walked in the door..."]}}
