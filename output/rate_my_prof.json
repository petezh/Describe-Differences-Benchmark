DO NOT TAKE HER!", "Wish I could take her for all accounting courses!", "Dr Estrada is a wonderful teacher. She makes everything so clear and easy to understand. She inspires you to reach your potential while being understanding of your problems. Her tests and assignments are easy if you come to class and try to learn the material. I highly recommend Dr E!", "taking Debra's class is a kind of enjoyment~ her class is full of fun and relaxation~ study ll never be a burden if u take her class~ Debra is definitely a good english teacher", "Koene is great! She's hard enough to make you think and work, but she doesn't give you busywork that doesn't make sense to do. She also likes to help students and is very patient. Plus, she's had such an interesting life!", "I'm taking her Help Desk Concepts class online and I love it! It's so easy and the assignments are easy to understand. She's very quick to respond to questions.", "TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. DO NOT TAKE HER. She is such a rude person, doesn't care about her students, doesn't thoroughly teach. If you don't understand something, too bad. When you ask questions, she will either laugh OR not even acknowledge you. I learned by asking OTHER STUDENTS, not the arrogant professor! Please don't take her! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE", "So easy and fun. She loves what she's doing. Its a class on how to use a computer and different things on the web. On class was spent discussing whether to buy a PC or a Mac. That was also one of our assignments. So easy and helpful. Just do all your homework and you'll get an A. She'll do whatever she can to help you. AWESOME!!!", "This class was an amazing experience for me. My bio background was beyond the intro level: however, the deep paper discussions were informative and her perspective as a geneticist refreshing. Her grading can be demanding, but always fair. She engages students with the material, and I even got to work on a project directly related to her research.", "The only reason I gave this professor a 4 was because of her lack of communication and her assignments were not clear 70% of the time. I took her online class ( I recommend if you want an A) I passed with an A because I did all the work on time, that's really all you have to do. Not hard at all, can be confusing at times that's all.", "If she likes you and your topic you will get a good grade on your presentation. If she isn't interested in your topic she will pick apart your presentation. You can put all your time into your speech and if she doesn't like you won't do well. Very biased teacher and isn't objective in grading.", "One of the most enriching classes I have taken during my undergrad. Dr. Siegfried cares not only about her students but about their academic achievement and challenges you to become a better writer, thinker, and human. Her expectations are incredibly high and getting an A is a challenge, so get ready to read and write but the work is well worth it", "Lets you know exactly what will be on the upcoming tests (as long as you stay until the end of class)! Extra credit is easy -- things like go on a hike, or draw and label a cell. She's a great instructor.", "Has no people skills whatsoever. She is rude and impolite. Acts as if she gets mad when someone doesn't understand, and asks for her to reapeat a step.", "She is very nice and caring. She'll help you when you need it! So far this class has been easy yet full of information. I would take her again if I could!", "She is very scatter brained. Although she knows her stuff her lecture is all over the place which makes it hard to take good notes. She makes up and writes her own quizzes with a lot of trick questions, so read the questions carefully! She will expect you to read and fully understand the class information before coming to class. Very hard Class!!!", "super nerdy but super sweet.", "Annie is a great professor. Very educated, helpful, and willing to read your papers and cope together to improve your style of writing. There is too much reading in this class more than 10 books in a limited time. If you are an advocate in the world of contemporary English novels, you will be fine.Read and share your ideas, you'll be okay.", "Mean, unapproachable, unhelpful", "Shes a very friendly woman, but she classifies herself as an \"auditory\" learner so most of her material is online and her lectures are mostly her speaking. Not a lot of examples. No book no actual homework to turn it. It's all online and on very vague notes. Would not recommend her at all if math isn't an easy subject for you.", "Unbelievably smart and has a wonderful way of boiling down ridiculously complicated critical essays into terms the average person can understand. Also is very funny in an intellectual sort of way. Had her for English 86 and am taking another class with her next semester solely because she is teaching it. A favorite.", "He opened my mind and then stretched it. Now I am a different person. Prof. Amdur is a wonderful teacher and mentor.", "If you take this class be prepared to write a lot. Linda is a harsh grader with the major assignments. Most of the assignments were a waste of time. She is not helpful and her instructions are unclear. She told me I had a good topic to write about and my summaries of articles were good but then tore apart my final paper. Don't take this class!", "her speaking not clear at all.one inclass essa(750ws),two essay(same)+final+ part marks her teachin is quit boring her class discussions help alot. Also, take notes of wat she said about shot,lighting,dramatic stit( asked in the final)foucs more on idea than gramma", "I Love Mrs Haynie! She is probably the funniest teacher I have had yet! She is so quirky! Her world lit class was one of my favorite classes.No textbook, just a study packet she has put together herself.Her test expectations are clear and she makes literature very interesting! Take this class!!", "Every conversation turned into some kindof race speech about how the african americans suffered. Got pretty annoying- and i dont think I learned very much. She is nice, but, eh?", "I honestly felt like I was in elementary school. All her quizzes were 10 questions and multiple choice. All her notes are on webct. The material is easy to begin with, but Ivy makes it so a 10 year old could pass with flying colors. Easiest A Ive ever gotten. Although the class is soooo easy, Ivy is also a genuinely sweet individual.", "Having Slusher's class (along with the other two pre-nursing courses) were a major wake up call for me. I was used to making A's and ended up making B's in all three of the courses. The tests are confusing, you basically have to choose the answer she'd want you to. She grades the paper really strictly so make sure you take it to the LRC beforehand.", "Proessor Koene has lost all touch with what it is like to be a college student. The class contains a ridiculously obscene amount of work for a few measly credits. This class has made me hate the Spanish language, no exaggeration", "Very helpful and good teacher. Workload was easy and grading was fair. I would take her again.", "She is amazing to listen to. My favorite class ever. Very discussion based. No tests. Three short papers (possibly creative project substitute), a group project, and two short write ups of your choice. Do your best to read, and talk with her if things come up. She can be flexible with assignments. She's not out to fail you, but you have to try hard", "margo is a great teacher...170 is a class that the ta's teach to get experience and it's too big for her to teach every1. do the work and u'll more than likely get an A. b/c the grads really want u to pass. 370 is a class she teaches and if ur passionate about acting take her. i really learned alot.", "Dr. Gfellner in her prime was apparently an amazing professor. I think she's gotten burnt out over the years and her class content reflects it. I passed because I bought the textbook and just took notes from it. I blocked her out during class and just did my own thing from the textbook. Her wardrobe is super jazzy though. Interesting to look at.", "horrible teacher!", "She was a good teacher, but I felt that she forced her feminist views on me a little bit too much. I am not sure how she feels about men, but I like men, so please... lay off the guy-bashing", "You have to study hard in order to pass her class. Attendance and class participation are mandatory. Homeworks every day.", "Dr. Sinning is wonderful. 1) she cares 2) read the notes & you're golden 3) MUST attend class to take notes 4) DO NOT buy the textbook.", "Joann is great. She really wants all her students to succeed and is always available to help you out if you have any questions. She taught a flipped instruction course which required a lot of studyingonline lectures for homework, but her lectures class activities always make the material easy to understand. Love her!", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Horrible, horrible, horrible. Once this teacher has it out for you, do not ever plan on passing her class!", "i really enjoy this class", "This prof is completely useless. I took this course online for only 4 weeks and had to drop it after the first quiz. Her modules made so much sense, however the questions on the quiz were worded so confusingly, it was like she wanted everyone to fail. Horrible prof, made an interesting, useful course into something hideous and disgusting. AVOID!", "She's a good teacher overall. If you are not experienced programming, I would recommend you take python before hand or some MOOCs. Otherwise it will be a little bit tough, not because of her teaching style but more so it's the Java language that other students find tough. And this class will prepare you for C++ 1 more so than python.", "Dr. Saffran is an excellent choice for Biochem2. The class is either filled with seniors or graduate students so you're not competing with freshmen anymore. Her tests are tough, but fair(NOT LIKE KUMAR!!!) and expect the occasional trick question. She adjusts the grade by a few points based on how well the class is doing. STRAIGHTFORWARD!", "Wow, I learned more than I thought I would. Paper discussions were the best I have ever had at Grinnell, labs, however, sucked--a lot. This was not Vida's fault though: yeast have a habit of not always working. In regards to Vida teaching 251, it is important to realize that ALL of the bio professors teach right out of the book", "Very sweet teacher. I like her. Lots of class discussion", "If you have her as your teacher - drop out! she is the owrst teacher. doesn't care about her students, disrespectful and unwilling to help. She enjoys seeing her student fail and is rude. She should not be teaching! she is one of those teachers that doesn't care because she has tenure and cannot be fired.", "She is the absolute best teacher ever! I love her! She's really funny to! You're the best Dr. Mirabella!!!!", "Dar is an amazing teacher.she wants you to learn, but you have to show the initiative. If you go to class and participate you will learn more than you ever expected. she is always willing to help. her passion for quality education inspired me so much", "Even though i got an A in this class it was a torture to go to every single class. She was so unprepared and unorganized. She was confusing and went on and on about one slide forever. She was hard to understand and so boring. Nice lady but if i had known i would have taken the class with someone else I learned nothing. Terrible professor.", "I think Rebecca is an awesome teacher. Yes, she does grade harder than others but thats made me try harder to get a better grade which isnt a bad thing. She makes learning fun! shes very sweet and I love her energy. I would definitely recommend taking her especially if your looking to have fun and learn at the same time. Good challenge!", "Last night I dreamt I went to Sparkyville again. I know that I could never go back, but I would like to. Professor Sparks is one of the most effective instructors in the department. Her lectures made me feel like Oliver Twist, for I truly wanted more. Take her class, you'll learn quite a lot, and you will enjoy it!", "She is willing to work with you and helps you. The class is paper based and make sure to do them and use the criticism to improve your writing.", "Leah is pretty cool. For starters she's really cute, so that helps. She is very helpful and smart. I really enjoyed her class and can recommend her to anyone.", "She is soo nice. Lots of homework but its easy. Tests are so easy!!! Especially if you have had prior spanish experiance. Makes class as fun as possible.", "Only take her class if you have to, if you can get a different teacher you should. I took her online computer class and she constantly changed the times things were due and closed drop boxes and quizzes/tests earlier than the time she said they would be closed on the syllabus. She wasn't overly helpful with anything.", "very cool teacher!", "Morna is so very sweet, I would love to talk to her about other matters than that of design or drawing. A great person with a lovely smile, but not exactly the best professor. Her directions for assignments are always different for each class it seems. She's helpful, but I don't think she always knows how to say what the best way to do something is", "Dr. Brown is by far the most incompetent teacher I have ever had in my entire higher education experience. If she is what we can expect from teacher education at UK, than UK does not take teacher education seriously. Disorganized. Unreasonable. Unclear. Incompetent. Ineffective.", "I did not like this professor at all, she's rude, condescending, and belittling to her students. She never actually gets to the point of what she's trying to say, so understanding anything in her class is really difficult, and then she makes you feel stupid for not understanding and having to ask questions. I would never recommend taking her class.", "Trish is understanding and easy to work with. She is really nice and she explains everything on a weekly basis for online learning. Lots of reading though and lots of home work. she did give a midterm and a quiz only a couple days away. nice but hard", "Beautiful woman. She will challenge your mind until you ache from thinking, but she is a genuine, interesting, and brilliant scholar. She treats you like an adult, meaning she is totally on your level, but expects nothing less than professional work and vigorous discussion. She is amazing, and I'm really disappointed that NYU is losing her!", "She is not a good teacher", "This is by far the worst teacher I have ever taken. The only advice I can give is DO NOT TAKE THIS LADY!!!! She asks questions in one way and grades how she wants. She asks an opinion question and wants your answers backed up with research.", "please..you dont need to study for that class. you come, sit, get an A. your brain is not worked at all. if you're looking just to get an A in foreign language requirements, take fre 101 and 102 with her. easy A", "Great teacher! loved every minute of this class.", "Her programs take way too long, including the tests. Her test questions take way too long. Even if you go to her office hours and go over the test, she goes fast and doesn't help a lot. HW assignments were dumb because she has specific answers to them, and her tutors grade them without the answer key.", "wierd lady... the exams are easy, but the final is like 5 times as hard as the regular tests... just make sure your prepared for that", "EASY!!! you dont have to go to class, she lets you do hw online and its extra credit, weekly quiz dont count if they hurt your grade, at the end lets you retake or make up a test of your choice.Test are from quizs and she makes copy of quiz with answers on them! No excuse to not have an A!!", "No joke, an amazing teacher and really cares about her students! Take her trust all the comments!", "I took another Con Law class in undergrad that covered the exact same stuff, but McCluskey really butchered the topics. She was pretty much incomprehensible, so I relied on my undergrad notes for this class. She means well and is nice, but doesn't really deliver.", "Mrs Moore is so helpful that at almost every opportunity there is a chance for extra credit, shes helpful and like in any class, DO THE HOMEWORK!! thats the only way to pass. she makes time available to help via office hours and through email and she has an SI leader help the class. Definitely gave me an opportunity to be happy with math again!", "Best professor I've had at WashU; great teacher, engaging and incredibly fair.", "Used Point System. To get an A we needed 320 ptS, she offered 710 pts. 2 tests and must get 50% to consider getting A. No final. Small quizzes in between (not required but if you want pts then take it) You can fail the quizzes and it wont matter bc its point based. Posts PPT lectures after class. I did so much extra work than I needed to.", "This has to be the WORST teacher i have ever had. Between her dull \"put me to sleep\" lectures to her egotistical \"i wrote the text book\" attitude all the way to her absolutly \"miss one symbol and you fail\" grading she is the worst i have ever seen. She doesnt care if you fail and wont help you if you are. If you are in her class, drop it ASAP.", "No Comments", "I think Mt. Johnson is an awesome teacher and is one of the few that really care if you get it or not. If you don't understand speak up and she will help you anyway she can to make sure you understand. I can't say enough good things about her. I hate algebra and she helps you get it even when it is hard for you.I got a B and I suck in this area.", "She will make you print out almost every reading for class. Will have at least three readings every night of at least 6 pages. Outrageous amount of work.", "One of the best Teachers I've had. Enrolled in her class for Differential Equations and Cal II.", "I just dont like her. She acts like she is friendly but she is actually not. She choose people to be nice to.", "Loved her as a clinical instructor. Classroom was wonderful. She made everything interesting and soooooo clear!", "SHE IS SIMPLY AMAZING!", "Wendy is one of the vew professors at RISD who is confidently at the top of her field and whose work and teaching are maintaining the school's much-hyped and currently somewhat fragile reputation.", "the previous comments are misleading she goes over material on a tuesday then will test on a thursday which is not enough time to study and complete the online tests and hmwk if you have a problem with a question she will not completely explain the answer but she has a nice personality", "Mz Serra is great! She cares about all her students and makes giving speeches fun! I'm no longer nervous to give speeches, because I know that she cares about me and only wants me to do well. Show up to class,give your speeches, and you'll get an A!!!", "Favorite instructor in the ECE department. She's professional, but alao so caring and helpful. She genuinely cares about her students. She gives so much amazing that is so helpful if you really go over it. Always has time for students if they want to talk about a grade. Brings in personal experiences to compliment a lecture/lesson. Great teacher!!!", "I really enjoyed Dr. Sowell's class. She is there to help her students and cares about how you do in the class. You have homework every night and tests are weighted heavy, but if you do the homework you should to good on tests. I would recommend her!!", "Professor Shelton is not a teacher for the lazy or for the procrastinator. She is willing to work with you and will talk to you about grades if you want to know why you got a certain score. You will generally be writing a paper every week, but as long as you keep up with homework, you won't get bogged down.", "Great class. Dana made English an enjoyable subject.", "Exact same structure as 442 - 10 cases, paper and presentation. Class is not hard, listen in class and take notes in packet. Pop an addy and memorize her study guide and you'll at least get a B. Pretty easy grader on paper. cases = waste of time, don't buy book just snap a pic of the cases.", "This was a boring class. It was tuesday and thursday at 10 and all she did was show us powerpoint presentations that she had made a long time ago. She told us where they needed updats, but I still didn't like it. She was very nice and very helpfull (esp. for students needing extra time) but she did not bring the subject matter alive for me. READ!", "Attendance is mandatory, there is a sign in sheet at the beginning of class so don't be too late. Kinda boring, alot of pp slides. Quizzes are not bad, just study all the slides bc you don't know what she's gonna ask. Papers weren't too bad, follow rubric and you will do well! Movies are interesting at the end of the semester. Read great books too!", "MAM is the bomb! She's a tough grader, but an extremely brilliant woman. You can learn so much if you listen and are involved in class. Do your work, show up to class, buy the book, study for exams/quizzes, and enjoy the classes she teaches!", "She did a nice job of showing us the sea. It was fun.", "Readings were decent, but the prof was terrible. Disdainful of student activism, completely closed to student input, gets really defensive and unpleasant if you raise critiques, especially closed to post-structuralist and deconstructionist approaches. She shows upsetting material depicting graphic violence against women in her classes without warni", "No Comments", "Fitch (aka Munoz)invests a lot of time and effort into teaching. Although the course material is abstract, she explores both the simple and complex aspects, creating depth of understanding. Her review chats online and discussion sections prepare students for the tests. A great class if you're willing to study and come to lecture.", "ANTH of Outer Space is possibly the best class I've had. Denning is an absolute delight! She is extremely quick-witted and can talk at length without putting everyone to sleep. Granted, I was very keenly interested in the content to start with. She's thought-provoking and funny. Her teaching style is casual but effective.", "The BEST prof I've ever had! never seen anyone being so passionate about the subject. She is very very helpful and really cares about her students:) The course involves a lot of readings but her lectures are incredible and really interesting which helps a lot :)", "This class was very difficult to me! She went over her notes and just read them...i felt like i didnt get enough explaination for the stuff she was teaching! Only grade she gave during that class was our test grades...so be prepared!", "Condescending. Her way or the highway.", "Shes nice but really boring.", "Super Nice! Great teacher. Super helpful. If you show up and put in effort she will help you to get a good grade!", "Hi I'm unknown. This professor should be ashamed for associating herself with humans because she's not.TCM210 is a fun course but this reptile Schubert makes it so impossible to understand what the hell is going on.", "Tests are based just off of the notes you take in class. Write down everything! If you can memorize all the notes then you should be fine. Some test questions are confusing. Gives a maximum of 3 percentage points for extra credit. Attend class every session that it is held and you will receive another bonus point. Overall, a pretty good teacher.", "This teacher is not effective. I graduated with a computer science degree from Denison and work in the industry now. She had no grasp of the material, and if she did, was not able to convey it clearly. When she retires, I will begin donating money to Denison.", "I could have learned more from a trained monkey. She was absent for the last month of class. She provided very little communication about what was going on and left the class in limbo. She then graded our paper after her return. We lost the chance to revise our papers as stated in the syliby.", "Great teacher.", "Dont even bother going to class and get an A. If you know access well", "Dr. Gubacs is my hero and I'm not even kidding. I loved her class (badminton, fencing, and tennis) and I loved her as a Professor. She is extremely professional, courteous, fun, I loved her drive and competitiveness, and really taught us how to teach!! I would highly recommend Dr. Gubacs as a professor. Taking her again in the fall.", "No Comments", "Do not take this class, if you have any type of a life or do not like to read, cause that is all you will do in this class is read , you will learn a lot about Great Britain though, but I wouldn't recommend taking her", "She's absolutely wonderful! She can be slightly vague at times, but mostly gets the point across. I like that she is thorough with her marking.", "this teacher is very nice but she is very hard to understand the whole class felt like a huge waste of time. i can truly say i didnt learn one thing knew from her. the class really felt like she let students teach more then she did. lots of test with very little extra points. also lots of random papers online you have to do. i would never pick her", "She is an awesome teacher. Took time away from her busy schedule to read over my essay and help me make some changes to it. She is a fair grader and an overall nice professor. If you have to take any type of writing or lit class take her.", "She seemed a little unorganized - slow at returning emails and rarely answered the questions I had.", "She's very buddy-buddy with students, not professional, so the environment is very comfortable but at the same time she's a tough grader. She loves to talk about her personal life... A lot! She does convey important aspects of public speaking, though.", "I'm graduating this quarter from CSCC and am transferring to another school and from all the teachers I have had so far professor Feth is by far the worst.Everybody giving a bad review on this teacher is right. She will not answer your questions and will talk to you like you are stupid. The point in taking a class is to learn and to be guided, not", "Does not explain anything. Can be vendictive. Be very nice to her or you will pay. She does not answer questions or offer help via email, claims she cant get it outside of class. Get very frustraited if you don't understand what she is saying.", "the class is too liberal, but the readings are interesting. average amount of work. I didn't like the papers, but she is VERY understanding. extremely nice lady and willing to help if asked. the class is set up as a discussion which makes it fun and interesting. papers aren't interesting, good class", "How can a professor be so bad? Because the social work program is so bad.", "Hi, I'm Katherine Jones... Let me push my book in your face. It's fantastic.", "Perfect!", "Mrs. Herbert is amazing! If you show up to class, pay attention, and do the work, you will at least pass, if not get a great grade. She's enjoyable and relational. Fantastic teacher!", "Super passive-aggressive. Asked her simple questions and gets confused. Tried to dumb the question down and ask again and she still was confused. Not surprised a lot of people dropped. Quizzes and boring documentaries every week. would not take again!", "She uses real life situations to go along with lessons. There is homework every week, but like the rest of the class participation shows in your grade. Attendance is graded. Don't try to just write random stuff for homework or it will show in your test scores. I would recommend her. I will take her class every chance I get!", "She was defintely the best teacher I've had so far at Loyola. I wrote a poem and wanted her to just critique it (it wasnt even an assignment) and she read it at a poetry reading. She picks out great material to read and is extremely laid back. She really knows how to relate to her students.", "Very nice teacher. She grades the papers fairly easily and she is pretty helpful as well. Only complaint is that sometimes class just seems to drag on... very boring sometimes. But overall i would recommend.", "No Comments", "Took an online speech class with her. Need to read the whole book! But the material was easy to read, she is readily available for questions. Awesome teacher!", "She has crazy eyes and makes no sense. The homework is ten thousand times harder than her tests. BOO.", "She is a good teacher. Caring and dedicated. Hot very hot", "Great Teacher! Loved having her as a professor!", "Professor Gregg is my favorite teacher at citrus so far. She is really passionate about what she teaches and will make you feel the same way. We didnt use the book alot the tests were easy if you paid attention and STUDY YOUR NOTES cause the questions are directly from them. I wish she could teach all my classes!! take her class!!", "Mima is a terrific teacher. She's very helpful and treats her students with respect. Anyone who has her as a teacher is lucky.", "Karen is an awesome professor, very peppy and into what she is teaching!", "She is an amazing professor who dedicates her time to teaching and getting to know her students. The level of work is appropriate for college, meaning there is a lot of reading and your brain will be put to work. She inspires you to learn and writes amazing recommendation letters. She has a solid background in law and psychology.", "Easy class, readings are sometimes confusing, but just do your best. Email her for any concerns or questions, she is approachable. Overall, do your best and it should be a chill class", "Great teacher! She's straightforward, funny, and makes the subject interesting. Barely used the book. Tests are on the notes. You have to do a few easy observations and some in-class group work.", "Bad teacher, Midterm is after the drop date. Hard to understand. She is always 10-15 minutes late to class and then takes smoke breaks right in the middle of her lecture. Hard to follow. Funny lady, just not good at explaining economics.", "She's very nice and friendly. Class is easy, mostly participation. First few classes are in a classroom. The rest are in a lab. For lab we get in groups and assemble and disassemble a lawnmower including the engine and describe the parts. I didn't know anything about engines beforehand so I was a bit lost, but after I looked it up online, I got it.", "This was the worst course I have ever taken, horrible experience! This professor is beyond unhelpful. When you get a problem wrong she doesn't explain what's wrong about it and just expects you to come up with the answer out of thin air after. She doesn't respond to all your emails so it makes it very difficult to communicate with her. STAY AWAY!!!", "Dr. Dunn rox!", "very dry. took her class because of the good ratings, if you are going to be taking English 86 don't do it with her!", "A very empathetic instructor, she pays attention to questions and feedback. She wants you to succeed. Do your best and you'll be fine.", "She gives extremely thought-provoking lectures, and is great at sparking discussion. However, I can't say I learned anything new, mostly we discussed current events. Worse, she encourages \"creativity\" on papers, but in grading them, she just wants students to spit back the reading. And there's way, way too much reading. Class=fun, homework load=bad", "she is a great teacher and I lover her in class, but she is very tough on grading", "Unreasonable professor who's too meticulous. If you're looking to take a class where you're graded according to your performance, this isn't the class for you. She has a set grading criteria on paper but fails to follow it herself at times. I highly recommend not taking her class.", "This was my first history class in years, but Professor Borgwardt made it really accessible. She was available readily outside of class to answer questions and her lectures were engaging and helpful. She expects a lot from you in terms of readings, but she's very clear about her expectations and helps you meet them.", "Yes, please never take this professor for Econ unless you want to fail or enjoy challenges. She is sooo hard to understand with that really thick accent, and she makes Econ harder than it is. DO NOT TAKE HER!", "Aruguete is Awesome! She makes me wanna learn. All her classes are fun and interesting. If you want a good grade, you will have to study really hard, on the bright side, she is always in the office (office hours) and ready to help with understanding a lecture or your homework. She is great! Good job Professor! Keep on doing what you are doing!", "The discussions we had in this class were not guided and vague. I felt it needed more direction. The books we read were close to unbearable. Class sucked but she is a helpful professor.", "Professor Zacate's class is very easy and it is chock-full of extra credit. However, she doesn't teach very well and makes students do online \"tutorial quizzes\" about the book's content. You can keep redoing them until you get it right. She also seems to get flustered at any questions that doesn't fit right into her framework.", "She's such a cute lady! Orella is super nice and outgoing, and she makes you feel comfortable in class. Only 3 essays total, and no exams. Easy readings assigned.", "Amazing!", "Dr Albanesi is by far the greatest professor that I have taken at UCCS.

She is incredibly knowledgeable and her lectures are riveting!", "She is great teacher!!! She help me on WPE test from Sacramento State. Her class is easy and fun. I enjoyed her class very much. After I take her class, my reading, and writing skill improve very much.", "Great teacher. Loves her students. If you respect her, she'll go to the end of the earth for you. She makes sure that the assignments given are portfolio quality - deffinatly not a waste of your time. She is a fair grader if you do your work and attend class - even invited our class to her house at end of the semester!! Great Teacher, Great Person!", "She is very dry and boring. The work is tedious, and she doesn't seem to bring any enthusiasm or real insight to the subject. Also, she told me I shouldn't go to grad school because I wouldn't make it. Guess where I am now.", "Highly recommend her. Came out of class being able to write good college papers. Assignments can be unusual, but it makes you think about what you are going to write. Available for help, can phone at home during weekends, evenings, and holidays. Will help you expand your thought process.", "I took her telecourse class. It was very hard because the information on the study guide did not match the information on the tests. She is a hard grader. When I tried to e-mail her w/ any questions she would only leave a vague answer.", "Wonderful professor! She loves what she does, and she understands that this class isn't essential for your career. All you have to do is write two short, easy papers, a powerpoint presentation, midterm, and final. The midterm/final can be difficult if you're not good at memorizing. But east A!", "Worst teacher ever! She takes points off on a test if you mispell a word, and last I checked this wasn't an english class. Seriously DO NOT take this class with her as the professor", "I have her for a summer class, and she didn't make the class even close to summer friendly!!! We had to do the exact same amount of work that the sixteen week class did and was almost totally non explanatory, but expeted us to damn well know! DO NOT TAKE HER FOR A SUMMER CLASS!!!!! You'll want to commit ritual suicide!!", "Giampetro is the sweetest professor at Loyola, and her class is probably the best I've taken. She makes the material so interesting and relevant. There is a bit of homework but nothing too challenging, you'll need the test for the hw but you could split with friends in the class. Tests are right from class work, not too difficult.", "She's a ruthless grader. Study groups are your best bet, but even then expect to score a lower grade than usual. She has no problem failing most of the class. Ewa tends to throw questions out of left field, and often it seems that there is an excess of overlap between questions. I do not recommend Ewa Wasilewska.", "Deb is awesome!! Her projects were really tough but she inspired me to forge ahead and I changed my major from Painting to ID mostly because of her. She is patient and easy to talk to and ALWAYS has time for students on an individal basis. If you get her, you are lucky!", "I love this class. I'm there everyday, hungover or not. She keeps you interested in writing. If I have a question, she has an answer. She does tear apart your papers but it's well worth it becuase you will become a better writer.", "She reminds me of Chris Rock. Her crude humor will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what she will say next? This class is everything you wanted your tenth grade health class to be like. Very easy B if you show up. You might not like her if you are easily offended or are uber sensative.", "she is great! she has the best personality and is always busting out into characters. i learned so much more than i thought i would from this class.", "Her passion is teaching Women's health and human sexuality, but if you take her for statistics she still teaches well, most of the assignments are easy and quizzes and take home tests are easy too.", "I really like this class. She kicked out some cheaters so that means she cares.", "Absolutely horrendous. Online class, and while I didn't have to do the chats weekly that some others mention, I can relate to the frustration. She grades things weeks after they are due, her class is completely unorganized, and she never responds to anything. Her feedback on your submissions is vague and of no help at all. I wish I could rate lower", "Lots of reading followed by class discussion over material. You know ahead of time exactly what is expected for assignments. So if you want to actually learn and participate in class do the reading. If not do the readings when the assigned papers are due. With the least bit of effort you can get a great grade. She is lecture heavy.", "Very nice and helpful. She's very enthusiastic about microorganisms and infectious diseases. Allowed me an extension on my paper.", "She's wonderful! She's an easy grader if you give her what she wants. As long as you follow the assignment, you'll be fine. It's obvious to see that she knows what she's talking about and her enthusiasm comes through her lectures. I would definatly take her class over again!", "Professor Hays was delightful! Never did I have an issue with her or teaching method. Hays was strict but fair. Mandatory attendance, if you pay attention to the details you will for sure pass her exams. Beware though her exams do become a bit harder. Hays can be rude sometimes but many overlooked it. I would take her again, made an A+.", "she's a little confusing and a little cooky, but pretty cool at the same time.", "No Comments", "She's a very nice person, quite old but seems to have a good head on her shoulders. Teacher wise- she's not very good. She never explains thorougly and never answers questions. She gets easily disappointed in your work because it's not what she wants. Highly unrecommended", "I agree that there are too many formal lab papers give this is just the laboratory component of one five courses that any student is dealing with", "Do NOT take this teacher if you want to learn spanish. She is extremely hard to understand and is horrible at teaching concepts. I barely made a B because I took spanish in high school i was just rusty. Also she is extremely boring and monotoned. I do not recommend her", "I think that she is a great teacher. If you are haveing issues in her class all you have to do is talk to her and she will help you out. She will not fail you if you try in her class.", "Dr. Jackson had an extremely arrogant attitude and when asked questions would snap. She was not helpful at all and would make snide remarks that made you think twice before even asking a question. Do whatever you can to avoid this lady.", "Dr. Renick has a tendancy to venture off topic, but if you truly listen to her lectures, you will find that she is an incredibly intelligent professor. She's not the typical egocentric prof, for her life experiences allow her to function on a realistic level while maintaining a solid intellectual foundation.", "She is an incredible math teacher and an incredible person! She cares about each and every one of her students and she will help you as much as you need it, she is fast at responding to emails and she is funny too. One of the most wonderful and the most memorable professors Ive ever had.", "I took Television History and Form with Professor Murray this semester. She is a good professor, very clear. A bit boring at times but overall a good class. Grading is done in a very straight forward manner, and if you go to class and do most of the readings/screenings you will get a good grade.", "Very rude. Is not empathetic at all, does she have human emotions? no one knows.", "Didn't learn much. This teacher is not helpful and biased. Do not take this teacher if you have a major that requires public speaking.", "meh...she's okay.", "One of the best classes I have ever taken.", "Excellent teacher. Very good personality. She dosen't like getting up early and I had her at 9 am. She let us come to the 8 am final and hour late and gave us a short final!", "Amazing professor! She always had extra study sessions before exams and even before our final. The homework was pretty easy, all online and you could do it until you had 100% on it.", "Amazing teacher she made me love to class and not a lot of teachers do that. She makes education fun when it's really not and she teaches you the best way and all of the criteria unlike other lazy professors. I recommend Kathy but at the same time a lot of people are getting to know she's the best so my advice is pray you'd get in her class", "Great class. Some stuff on the test is from the lecture, but not much. I would listen to the back story and author bio, but you either need to read the books or listen to the lecture - not both. Exams are easy if you read/paid attention. She's very nice but a little senile.", "I'm taking her children's lit class right now. She's very interesting and tries hard to keep the class interested and attentive.", "unclear subject matter, plays favorites", "She is THE BEST professor I have ever had. She makes things incredibly clear and she teaches the simplicity of things without making you feel stupid. She is so helpful if you don't understand something and she is very approachable! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR! SHE'S INCREDIBLE!", "No Comments", "Super easy class for nonmusic majors. Definitely have to put effort into studying for exams if you want a good grade but there are a lot of easy points in the class to boost your grade if you don't do well on the exams. Tons of extra credit points (I went into the final exam with over 100% in the class). Online HW due before class is easy.", "This professor is very helpful and teaches about very relevant material. She expects a lot from students, but it's all worth it. I learned a lot and would definitely take her class again!!", "There was a major lack of communication with this professor. She did not return emails and seemed very confused about grading. I would not recommend her. If you can find another professor for this class... go with it. She takes weeks to grade and is very \"last minute\" about it. I paid for her class and yet was never able to communicate with her.", "lots of reading but it's nice because there are weekly quizzes instead of tests. you can tell she is passionate about the subject. she's a cool gal", "She doesn't really teach she just goes over projection notes that she's made. However, she does give you copies of the notes which help when trying to study. But in order to pass you have to pay some serious attention.", "Professor Moore is the BEST math teacher I've ever had! I'm horrible at math and I struggled in this class but she helped me so much and never allowed me to give up. She truly motivates you to want to do well and gives a lot of positive reenforcement. Tests are all cumulative which is tough but there are plenty of review sessions. Take her!", "Did not like her, one of the worst teachers I've ever had. Very boring class, and don't waste your money buying the book because you'll never use it.", "she is one of the best teachers i have ever had she is amazing", "I highly recommend Professor Herbert. She goes above and beyond what is expected of an instructor. She allowed me to use a Mac version of Microsoft Office. It was more work for her, but she was very kind. Great instructor and great class!", "I Love you Debra!", "She is a great professor! I loved her class and thought that she did a great job teaching it.", "Most lectures are half lecture half movie, not very specific on what you need to be paying attention to. Beware, she will not reply back to your emails. Feedback for our research paper rough draft was given back to us 3 days before the final draft was due. She makes you take all the tests twice for a \"chance\" to do better but, its not worth it. :(", "No Comments", "Actually a decent teacher. Her powerpoint presentations were very helpful, I barely read at all. The book is $300 which is ridiculous, and she is the only teacher for 202 that uses that book. Her final test is BS and she doesn't curve at all so beware", "Nice teacher, explains well. If you want to do good in MATH208 do past midterms and finals!! Sometimes similar questions come up and sometimes the EXACT question comes up with the same numbers! So whoever you have as a teacher just do past exams and understand the material", "Easy teacher, but sometimes slow in getting grades back to you.", "Se\u00c3\u00b1ora Zahajko's was an \"Intensive\" class so it only last 5 weeks, so you have to engulf yourself in the class. I enjoyed it, and having Spanish before I really appreciated her style. Shes culturally rich with info, and breaks the language down very well. DO NOT take with very challenging classes, as this will consume you with HW, but take her!", "If you have a full time job, and are taking three classes, do not take her class. The only people who have time for 3+ hrs of studying per night are running start students who have no bills or other classes! She barely responds to emails& You will not know your grade until the report after the final. Do not take this class!!", "She gives a lot of homework and quizzes but is really enthusiastic and wants students to learn. Good about giving extra help outside of class and grades fairly.", "She is a great teacher, she is willings to help her students in any way that she can. She is very undertanding and caring. She is a fun teacher and makes learning math fun and interesting. Excellent teacher, if your having trouble in math i recomened taking O'Bryan b/c she will teach you good.", "I like Mrs. Perry. I am currently taking her Child 114 online class. Her Hw is very easy! Her website is a bit confusing but not totally unmanageable. I have learned so much in her class & totally recommend it. Its easy... I have put minimal effort in and have 100% on all my work! :)", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Emily is the best Jazz instructor I've had so far. She has helped me a lot while studing my leg problem & by helping me do in class drills. She is so sweet, loving, caring, & full of excitement. U Rock my world! Stay Sweet!!:)", "Class was interesting and she knew a lot about the subject. The was very upbeat and tried to get the class to participate. The papers were not hard and she gives you a rubric and went over the reqirements in class plenty of times. I never had a hard time finding her in her office. Definitely not a blow off class so slackers beware!", "awful. would not recommend unless you are in running start and don't have a job. she says she goes over homework so you can have the right answer when you turn it in. not true. runs through class so fast and expect you to pick it up and repeat it back but unless u already have somewhat of a solid foundation in Spanish you will be left behind.", "Can often act too silly or goofy while teaching, and will stray away from the lesson. Goes off topic a lot. Not good with words nor is she really understanding.", "HARD CLASS. Do NOT take. I heard it was easy but it most certainly was not.", "Dr. Toth is awesome. She was the reason I passed her class. She always makes sure you get missed assignments/quizzes done and turned in, and is always there to help. There is quite a bit of material and you should always go to class...but she is fun to be around, especially once you get to know her. One of my favorite psych professors!", "She was an absolutely amazing professor. I really loved her. She just had so much positive energy and such a great attitude. She made me appreciate Theatre. If you have any chance to have her, do it! You won't regret it. Very easy and fun too, I miss her as a professor.", "Let me just say she's nice but if you took her you're better off taking the class online. She often goes off subject, she can't keep a straight thought. Tests are 25 questions over 3 chapters and you're not sure what will be on the test. The paper was easy. Just make sure you read. Her slideshows are useless, she doesn't know how to work them.", "redmond is intelligent, experienced in her field, knows what she's talking about. the class is a lot of work but you learn so much. id totally recommend her!", "Eli is a wonderful teacher. Keeps you thinking. Highly recomended. He's not an easy grade, but he'll help you get there. A must take!", "Easy work attendance matter because pop quizzes can happen which are open notes and she's caring a real darling", "This class has probably been one of the worst I have taken since coming to UTD. Unless you REALLY like lectures that will put you to sleep and primates...stay away!!! She grades very hard and the lectures seemed very disorganized and unrelated to required readings.", "Dr. Blanck is such a nice lady, but she's an okay teacher. She's really not BAD, but shes not the best. Her classes feel long and her lecturing isnt too great, at least in y opinion. She uses powerpoints a lot, but make sure you write down what she SAYS, too. Shes so nice and will help you with anything that you need, even outside of class.", "Professor Dogru is extremely nice. Very approachable and always willing to explain concepts until everyone understands. Easy to listen to for those 2 hour courses, and gives a break if you need it. I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND Professor Dogru to any student taking MTH 202. She made retaking 202 a breeze.", "I have Prof. Wallace for Advertising and Society, and I love her! She obviously knows a lot about the subject and has a lot of interesting, educated opinions (although she doesn't object to discussion). She has a lot of visuals (necessary for this kind of class) and plus, she's just adorable! But she doesn't take****, so don't give her any.", "Great class, I really enjoyed attending. Took the summer course and Ms. Maguire is an amazing teacher, really enjoyed her lectures, as long as you focus, and study, she's awesome.", "Do not take her for any classes. She is terrible with handling grades and getting papers back on time. She is very unorganized, and rude when people go against her perception of what is right. URGE you to take someone else!", "She is very funny and easy to follow, even if you have never had ASL before.", "Smart lady, really knows her stuff. She does a lot of hands on learning and discussions. You usually get out of class early too!", "very nice, made the class easy and fun", "With the right amount of studying and effort, you should do well in this class. You have to be well prepared for each lab because you work individually, and most labs do not leave enough time for one to fix an error. Overall, it was annoying to put so much effort in the class, but by the time you finish the class you will know the bio lab, well.", "everyone who thinks this woman is brilliant is horribly mistaken. her lectures consist of run-on sentences composed 90% of adjectives which are similes of each other. \"this passage is strange... mysterious... illuding... conspiratory...\" if that is what it means to be brilliant, then brilliant is the last thing i would ever want to be", "wonderful wom.an who wants to help everyone", "Be prepared to teach yourself if you take this class online. Instructor offers no help. She very rarely checks or responds to emails. I was excited at first, to take this class and ended up very disappointed.", "Never had a a professor that opened my eyes and my mind like Eli Amdur did. He invented this course \"Creativity,Change, and the 21st Century Leader\" and it's the most useful, inspiring, and fun course I ever took. His approach is so inclusive and engaging and he is a world of knowledge and wisdom. I see the whole world differently now.", "Not a fan of American Literature, however, now a fan of Professor Mills. Excellent teacher.", "She seems like a really sweet lady but is one of the toughest teachers ever. I basically had to teach myself everything and her deadlines are super early. Attendance is mandatory and she is speaks in a monotone voice which makes the class more of a bore. I do not recommend her!", "It is almost finals week, we have TWO TESTS for grades and we had to go visit a museum on student study day (btw she cancelled the trip to the museum at 5 in the morning, and then told us to go anyway for a grade). no real office hours, just \"catch her\". There is no h.w YOU must PARTICIPATE in the class discussions. she uses the word stupid ALOT!!", "She is so nice, always smiling and so helpful. She is very good teacher and specially to direct students in master and phd.", "She isn't to hard, have two read two short books for the class and although she tells you to red out of the main textbook I only did three times. Paper at the end of class based on document with presentation but it's not to bad. She's so nice but boring and is obsessed with slavery, take her if you have a moderate interest in History", "easy!!! she was hyped on coffee all year, but was extremely easy. she related everything to students.", "I really enjoyed this professor. She was very open and honest in discussions. I can tell she enjoys sharing her extensive knowledge. If I would've had her class sooner I would've considering changing my major. She grades fair and challenges students to do their best. She really had a positive impact on my life by what I learned.", "awesome", "No Comments", "Professor E is such a sweetheart and will make you think outside the box. Her class is engaging and a real thought provoker. I used to absolutely detest having to take English but she changed the way I feel about the subject. You will leave the class with a new and improved sense of analyzing situations and a new sense in creative writing.", "I will never take another online class again because of her.", "nice lady but bad advisor. she cancelled my advisment appointment and never returned my emails.", "She often does the problems wrong in class which becomes very confusing. Also will not allow you to make up work even if you have legit reasons. Id suggest the MWF class rather than Tuesday and Thursday", "Dr. Huntley is Awesome. She is extremely easy too", "Catherine was hard but good. She knew her stuff and helped her students get jobs at good places. I think all ya'll dissing her are just mad because she gave you a bad grade.", "Professor Borgwardt is one of those professors that gives hope to the world of academia by ensuring future academics are mentored well. Her lectures and discussions are fascinating and she is attentive to students' and their interests outside of class. Her office hours are frequent. Her insight is incredibly valuable, and she is genuinely kind.", "she was the worst professor I have ever had in my four years in college.", "Mrs. Mach is a really cool teacher. She jokes around with everyone and makes you feel comfortable. I would recommend anyone to attempt to get her for an English teacher!", "Dr. Iftode is great!

The assignments can get a little tough, but you'll certainly learn a lot from her if you're interested in the material!", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Prof Willis is a true class act and the consumate professional. She is an asset to SJU. She sheppards many young teachers through the process in a great way.

Absolutely NO sense of humour, turned red in the face yelling at me because I made fun of one of her stuipd assignments........good luck if you have her, you'll need it!!!", "Professor Carr is one of the best professors I have had thus far. She is extremely open minded and loves to hear your opinion regardless of her agreeing with it. As for people complaining about the amount of books and reading, you can get her books cheaply online, and don't complain about reading when you are in a literature class. That is silly!", "Very enthusiastic about physics. very weird twitching habits, especially with eyebrows. But overall a nice teacher. Physics 1 is really easy, but physics 2 is very hard.", "amazing, beautiful person. so caring and passionate about her subject area. more than fair tests, interseting lectures, and always willing to offer extra help! super fun lady! awesome classes.", "Difficult class... we read on an average 100 pages worth of work, quizes are hard but ask fairly general things... i would suggest getting cliff notes (even though you are not supposed to) to re-enforce the readings... it makes the book much clearer", "ms. serra is an awesome teacher. very unusual, but extremely fun and helpful. a must have class", "No Comments", "Mrs. Malitsky does not explain anything in class, just teaches out of the textbook word for word. The exams are ridiculously hard and the examples in the class lecture and homework do not help you prepare for them.

She helps you bump up your grade as much as she can. Go to class - she takes attendance. Do the WebSAM homework assignments just to get them out of the way early. Otherwise, you'll be spending 2 hours online on it. I recommend her! :)", "Ms. Campos is a nice person, Scattered sometimes. She does take roll and has an online lab that has about 35 assignmets per every two weeks, but most lang. classes will. She's understanding and VERY lenient. She doesn't speak amazing english, but she is understandable. If you're naturally good @ spn I recommend, if not you'll need to work a little.", "Shes a great and very professional person. Within 4 days i was able to complete all my questions and most important part of her teaching is that she is taking her time to explain and wants every one to understand before she'll move on to the next problem. I would highly recommend her . Shes very pleasant . Thanks prof.", "Beware you can't get higher than a B!", "She is great. A little bit boring, but makes sure everyone gets everything. I guarantee after this class you will understand all you didn't understand before. Gives a lot of homework, but you don't have to turn it in. However, it helps a lot to do homework.

ALSO RECOMMEND HER HUMANITIES AND DAN2100 CLASS", "Kathy! I love her so much! I took photo 7 and 9 with her and she is such a fun enthusiasts teacher! if you take her hybrid class be prepared for lots of videos and lab work outside of class. she's really heavily focused on pushing you to your next and best level. I wouldn't have taken any other teacher 4 photo. she was the best ever!", "I like her! She DOES talk very, very fast lol. But she is entertaining and doesn't out me to sleep! Very smart, smart woman. Funny too, some of the stuff she says is so off the wall and out of nowhere when she does to make a point but it's like \"Lol, that was funny.\"", "She is a very good teacher. Very knowledgeable about art history. Her lectures are very thorough and you have to able to take good notes. Her exams are hard but she curves and there is extra credit, so its not too bad", "This women is a total nut. She is nasty, unclear, and arrogant. She doesnt treat you like an equal, and leaves unprofessional comments in her emails. She is late with grading, and refuses to answer questions without getting mad or making you look stupid. I wouldnt reccomend this professor at all. Im an A student,and I think this lady is an airhead", "enjoyed her class", "i liked this professor i thought she was fair , helpful and mad class fun , most of the stuff she did was jus show us alot of french movies. Which taught me the language better lol . not but i did catch up on some sleep. but review the movies because it will be on her exams.", "Not clear about what she wants.

She has a lot of experience with undergraduate students.", "I would recommend this teacher to no one ever. She's takes a month to grade assignments, she takes two weeks to respond to emails, then it'll be to late because the assignments due date has passed and there's nothing she will do you just have to take the loss.

It will blow your mind.", "Easy teacher, doesn't have much experiance, just got up and left in the middle of a term. I don't know where she went off to.", "She knows her sh*t. A freaking math genious to boot. She really wants you to understand the material, and is always very helpful, and is more than willing to reexplain for clairity. She also realizes that the material is extremely complicated, so she makes the tests easy. :)", "Easiest math class ever. Attendance is not mandatory and homework is extra credit. You can even make up one test at the end of the year. Granted she is not the best teacher, but the material is so easy and the tests are as well that you do not even need a teacher. Take her if you are not good at math and just want an easy A!", "she's the coolest teacher i've ever had", "Pretty condescending and likes to be a dictator, which she'll tell you from the beginning. If you don't do every little thing her way, you're not going to do well, no matter if a different way works better for you or not.

She is young, always good, and has a relatively laid back and sarcastic teaching style which I thoroughly enjoy.", "I took her class over the summer and it was hybrid. It was so easy!

I took the online version as long as you do the work and really try you can get an A. There is a lot of homework but it is pretty easy you just have to follow the book.

You need a code for this class and if you buy outside the school you still have to pay for it.", "There is 5 books to read in this class, and every single class period you have a quiz. the quizes are 65% of your grade so if you are not willing to do the readings DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS THEN. she is nice and respected but can be rude when people are rude. we only have one paper to do in that class and for the final you had to come finals week.", "This teacher is the bomb, She is easy, you will just have to do a couple papers, and her tests are also easy. If you try really hard, then u wasted ur time, u can barely try and get a B, or try a little bit and get an A. Shes is so easy to understand, and she isnt boring.. TAKE THIS TEACHER", "This is my second time taking her class, and she is a spectacular teacher. Her class is heavily dependent on assigned readings and class discussions, but overall, is rather chill as she is very open-minded.

If you're not much of a talker, do expect your grade to suffer though.", "Angela is awesome, she makes english to intresting and explains everything is such a manner that everything makes sense!", "Well- the class was SO easy- mostly b/c i took the same class in high school. I never did the homework- just sort of paid a little bit of attention and did fine. The tests are EXACTLY like the online review she puts up- except that the numbers are different. An easy A. Talk to her- she will be more willing to help if she knows your name.", "Your grade depends on how much she likes you instead of how well you do with your work. If you are ethnic minority, the chance she doesn't like you is very high and you'll be discriminated against in many possible ways, especially in those areas almost impossible for students to challenge her decision. She enjoys breaking hearts for no good reasons", "She puts too much of a workload on her students, and she doesn't even teach! She has groups present and teach straight from the book. Hello, who is the professor? Not to mention her grading scale is very steep, you have to be a perfectionist to get an A. You have no idea how she grades exams and what she looks for, so good luck.", "She's very nice and she knows what she's talking about. Make sure to take good notes!!

I also like her as a teacher, I think she teaches very well, personally. However, she is very \"unforgiving\". She accepts nothing late and is a very harsh grader.

If you want to pass any of your other classes you should not take her. She is so unclear and assigns so much work. If you ask a \"dumb\" question she laughs at you. Thinks everyone is stupid. Such a hard grader. Tried to give benefit of the doubt but she is horrible. Take my word...", "WOW! she is the most unclear professor I've ever had. She expects everyone to grow up and be a professional journalist for the new york times. She grades very hard and unfair, never expect a 10/10 on homework. Don't bother asking for her help she won't give it to you, she is overall insane and should not be teaching. DONT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER", "Very good teacher!", "the class isnt easy, its a 300 level course but when i took the class she seemed like she was a little confused herself on what to teach.. always seemed like a spontaneous class", "Come on guys - she's pretty easy - I got an A - just a little boring that's all.

Her classes are always interesting and though she strays sometimes she always incorporates the topic of the day.", "Doesn't teach well. Avoid.", "There is a huge group paper and lots of long lectures. There were plenty of (class related) movie days. The real problem I had with the class was the actual grading. It didn't seem standard at all, more like it depended on what mood she was in. This is kind of teacher to not round up your grade. You've been warned.", "AWFULLL! you have to buy a bunch of books and read them within a week. about 80 pages of reading for each class do not recommend at all. also her grading system is HORRIBLE! it's based on how much you talk in class but she doesnt let u kno how u are doing mid semester and very rude to students. HORRID EXPERIENCE", "Sound informative and very interesting. Does bring family home life into class but always puts them in context of lessons being taught.

She's extremely intelligent, passionate, and beautiful. She is also very nice, helpful and understanding. She gives the best lectures at York. There are a lot of readings, but its not necessary to do them all, and it's not hard to get an A.", "I've been reading some of the other comments made about Ms. Yearwood and I don't get it. She is very informative and obviously a very intelligent person. Just because she expects you to do your work...Because it's College...doesn't make her a bad teacher.", "I know I'm in the minority, but I liked her. She's is very knowledgeable and friendly. In the beginning, I didn't care for her, but she grew on me. In the end, I realized I learned a lot. She tells you exactly what to expect on exams.

Her lectures tend to be a bit boring, but she's a fair grader. All her tests are essays (and she gives you possible questions before hand so you can prepare). Easy A!", "She is a very friendly and enthusiastic teacher. Really easy class; just had to give four speeches and take two online tests. Easy grader. Cancels class or ends early a lot, so it would be good to take her last in the day. An issue some people might have is she talks about your speech right after you do it in front of the class.", "The best teacher I had so far at Cal! Very involved with her students success and very easy to talk to.", "No Comments", "I love English, I spend my free time writing and have always prided myself on my writing skills. She made me hate this class. Her attitude towards her students is similar to 1st graders. Her 101 class is pathetic and she only helps students that are basically failing instead of those that put fourth effort. I don't recommend this to ANYONE!", "Excellent teacher!! Always willing to answers your questions. I would recommend her to any students interested in Graphic Design. She is able to relate real world experience to us.", "une des meilleures professeures que j'ai eu. Bravo.", "No Comments", "If you don't agree with this professor you are guaranteed to fail. The teaching of this course is not based on reality. I agree ... dreadful course!", "Had her for online mcb2010c, she will not reply to your email..so get used to that!

My wife, who is a native french national laughed everyday.... Because I was literally being tought.... nothing! I learned more at home. I paid for this class?....Aviod this one guys. Don't let the other posts fool you. Its confusing and ridiculous. Not easy either.", "She chooses monotonous books to read about court session, criminals and jury. On top of that, she gives a little time to read, 100-120 pages for example, 2-3 days, and students must analyze and bring citations with typed responds. We should have a spare time on weekend, should not we?", "She grades tough. I had another teach re grade papers and the grades where very different.", "She is the sweetest woman on campus. Cares so much about the students and preparing them for success in the class and in the real world. Weekly reading assignments and quizzes. Questions are given with the reading and if you answer them you will do fine on the quiz. Two midterms and a final all open note so take good notes. Final optional.", "I really enjoyed this class. She is so helpful and understanding. If you attend class, you'll get an A. It's so difficult to do poorly. The cultural things she teaches are so great and fun to learn. I'd take her again.", "Cynthia is a very great instructor, she really does her best to get everyone involved! I enjoyed her class very much, but I'm not much of a morning person. So my brain was only half awake! Very sweet lady!", "She uses a point system that confused most of the students. We had quizzes everyday over the chapters. Tests weren't too hard but she did provide one extra credit assignment.", "No Comments", "Ugh...she was odd. Her tests were hard. The sections were easy but pointless. Assignments were very easy. Didn't go class half the time and made a B-", "Professor Iten managed to make me dread bio lab every single week, and she was barely in the room during lab. She wrote the lab manual, which made simple concepts overly-complicated and lab procedures convoluted. They grade the lab on accuracy rather than effort even though the point of the course is to gain familiarity with lab. Overall; awful.", "GOOD TEACHER..DO YOUR WORK TRY YOUR BEST..SHE IS FAIR IN HER GRADING..THIS CLASS WILL BE HARD IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT WRITING PAPERS BUT IF YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO IMPRESS HER YOU'LL DO GREAT!", "Kathy is a very laid-back type of professor.

She really made class fun, and her crazy comments always made me laugh. Definitely take her, she's awesome.", "Difficult subject but I somehow managed to get an A. She is nice but gets mad if you talk in class. She will help you any way she can. Attendance is only mandatory in that if you don't show up you won't have a clue what is going on.

The only assignments are 5 exams and 1 term paper.", "great teacher, very nice, very helpful, i hate english in general but she is a good teacher :)", "small readings due every class, not long tho. 5 short 500 word essays but she grades them easily. she grades on how drastically you change your paper from the 1st draft to the last. She really likes a lot of changes. no tests. 1 final-essay", "No Comments", "Dr. Asplin is really knowledgeable and is good at explaining tough material. She is a great resource of information for psych students especially. She can come across as very serious at times, but she's also very laid-back and forthcoming about her expectations.

She was very helpful to me and I hope I have her again as a prof in the future.", "Some are writing teachers because they can't make it as writers. She is one of them. Very mean - very arrogant - lousy. Okay as a person, but not as a prof.", "She is a great professor! She is pretty gracious, but does expect a lot from her students. I would take her again for Aural in a heartbeat!", "The class has no use at all... powerpoints useless, when you ask questions she skips over them not answering them. She doesn't know how to use a computer. she couldn't figure out how to log on to the computer one class so we didn't do anything. every class she repeats herself on what she said in the first class of the semester. Overall very boring!", "She is like my favorite teacher, and she can really play. She isn't to serious and she isn't afraid to laugh at us when we sound bad!!!", "Did not learn anything by taking her class. She'll tell you that you're writing is improving, and then give you a C+ on five straight assignments. Definitely would not reccomend her to anyone.", "This was the hardest teacher I ever had....I studied my butt off and still didnt understand her or pass the test....She doesnt put what you study on the test", "This is the WORST teacher I have ever had in my life and if you have her I would suggest dropping it immediately. She is the most miserable women I have ever met. She talks down to all her students and if you ask her a question she will either laugh at you or embarrass you in front of the class. I hope Columbus State will get rid of her soon!!!!!", "This man is a genius. I have the utmost respect for him. There are many very smart professors at Gburg but this man blows them away. Its a very hard class but he's a fair grader. He also takes the time to answer any of your questions anytime.Niiro Rocks!", "My class was once a week and 4 hours (stats class). She did not give us any homework since the class was so long. I think sh explained things well but statistics is just difficult for me as it is for most people. She let us use a notecard on one of the tests. She really was great though and I recommend her. Sometimes she would let us out early.", "She is great! A bit random at times but her class is very easy and she is very helpful. Definitedly take her for common curriculum!", "Very interesting class, she puts it all in an understandable historical context. The art and the context takes precedence over memorizing artist/title/date. Lots of reading.", "Best Spanish professor I've had. She loves her students, keeps the class entertained, and is a wonderful teacher!!", "I'm telling you guys she's so easy and helpful a little bit confusing but just stick to the review test and then that's it", "Very nice person, helpful, and funny.

Her class is very interesting~!", "She's an amazing professor. As long as you study her notes you'll do fine on the tests", "Teacher was laid back and very helpful.", "Professor Sparks is a ball of joy. She is an excellent lecturer who is extremely knowledgeable of her mainstream field of expertise (Victorian Novels/ 19th Century Novels). The lectures are quite heavy, yet super interesting. Be ready to read a lot though (6 novels of about 300-400 pages each 1 every 2 weeks). Good feedback. Demanding conferences", "Professor Usyk is great. I had her for Cells and Molecules lab at Stockton. She's very relaxed in lab and makes class fun. I would take her for lecture if I could. She explains the intros very clearly and teaching is so natural for her. Tests seem hard but you have to put in the effort and study everything. If you know the material, you'll be fine.", "Professor Sweely is one of my absolute favorite human beings. She is so full of knowledge and you can tell she loves her job. She even makes lectures about thousand year old art interesting. The only down fall of the class is that there are only about 5 grades for the whole year, so you must do well on all of them. Relatively easy A.", "Prof. Lindahl was great. She knew that almost the entire class was taking it because it was an easy UP. Easy homework- online music guides that had to be completed in a week. No reason why you can't get an A. All the answers were in the book, so the assignments were very easy. She's a great prof. if you don't understand music, as she makes it fun!", "Learned alot in her class. When she said what you learn in speech class will help later in life (ie job-related, and just plain communicating with people) she meant it. Didnt care for public speaking before her class, now I wonder what the fuss was about. She made it simple. Great teacher, but tough. Condescending at times, but means well.", "Shes wonderful, and considering i hated the subject thats saying something. Learning about research papers is tedious on a good day but shes fun and smart and thought provoking and i never dreaded going to class. It certainly is work but never more than can be handled. You may not like the subject but you walk out with skill.", "Haters stop hating. Charisse is probably the most real person/professor/dean you will ever confront in your lives.

I got high A's on everything (including second test and the final) except for a B on the first test and a B+ on one paper and I got a B- in the class. You are required to comment multiple times each period. Have to keep a time consuming journal. This class is absolutely not worth the effort.", "Dr. Davis is super laid-back and more than willing to work with students should they ask for help. The reading material can get a little dry, but I think Dr. Davis does a great job of leading class discussions. She is a great professor and mentor.", "No Comments", "Outstanding.", "No Comments", "Don't get me wrong, Ellie is probably one of the nicest and most interesting people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting, however her lectures are confusing! She provides very little structure and tends to get off topic (a lot) when teaching Lacan. Chances are unless you're a grad student, you're not going to get anything from this class.", "I really enjoyed having this professor. You had to work to earn your grade but her exams and quizzes were reasonable if you studied and knew your material. You had homework but not very much and didn't take very long to do. Sometimes she is a bit hard to understand but will clarify if you just ask. I would recommend this professor.", "Dr. Brown is one of the best professors I have ever had. This course truly feels like what you might expect for an elective -fun, simple, and engaging. All of the writing comes from your heart (no outside research is necessary). I had her for both Postmodernism and Modernism, but you don't need to take Modernism for Postmodernism. I recommend.", "Honestly it all depends on the student. I'm not good at biology at all, but reading the book actually helped a lot because I wouldn't grasp anything while I was in lecture. There are 4-5 midterms which are way better, than just the one because it'll be 2-3 chapters at a time rather than chapters 1-10 for only 1 big accumulative midterm. Take her!", "I did not like her as a professor. She was terribly boring and moved way too fast. I was too busy writing her notes that I did not have time to process what she was saying. I can honestly say I felt sad when I knew I was going to her class.", "She is a very nice professor. If you do not understand a concept all you have to do is ask and she will go over it until you grasp the concept. I wish she taught more courses than she does. I would recommend her to anyone.", "She needs to leave this department!!! She has such a low level interest with all students. She makes references to classes she does not communicate with the other professor. Her basic skill knowledge of computers is limited. Cant stand her as a teacher !!", "Professor wallace clearly knows what she is talking about and she always tries to make the class interesting. I HIGHLY recommend her as a professor for any subject within communications.", "She makes clear at the start she uses a \"flipped\" teaching style, in that students teach students and she guides. It is quite literally that, and with it being an intro class, no one has any clue what they're teaching. You learn everything on your own, she teaches nothing and occasionally shows videos. She stresses she is lazy, and she sure is.", "I took her in the summer and i loved this class! she is such a great teacher. i had this class for 4 hours and she made it fly bye. she has a way of breaking up the class that makes it bearable.", "My favorite professor so far. Calm, cool, easy going and informative. A+ Alison! :)", "Sanchez is a total freak. Talking about sex with college students, makes her day. If you are a christian or have any set of morals beware! She is the most extreme liberal professor I've ever had! I respect the fact that she has an opinion on issues like abortion, but she WILL try to force her extreme liberal views down your neck!", "One of the most genuinely nice and caring ladies i've ever met. Cares about the well-being of her students and how they are doing in the class. Yes, she is a difficult grader, but she makes you a MUCH better writer! Go to her office hours, show up to class, and turn things in on time and you should have no problem getting a high B or A.", "Great prof. Brillant thinker. Very dry sense of humour. Great readings. This class turned out to be a lot more interesting and fun than I originally anticipated.", "Good Teacher, you learn lots of info in class but she grades to hard on little****!", "Knows her stuff - maybe too well! Hard classes but only because she cares. You will have to study. Want to learn? Take her classes.", "Before I say anything else I liked Ida as a Human. Ida is the nurse that would've administered Zyklon B to the Jews, but only if the APA formatting was correct. Ida is the definition of a bureaucrat. She wastes 1/4 of semester covering syllabus/student handbook/APA formatting. PON paper is about format, tests are MOSTLY power-point.", "She is a very good teacher. Unlike some teachers, she teaches you how to write and don't spend a whole class period talking about nothing. She is there to help; she even fuss if no one goes to her office to get help. She doesn't grade hard at all. I got a B in the class.", "Show up, review a bit, pass. It's that easy with such a brilliant professor as Bvb. No reading required, just a CD that is optional if you need help reviewing before the 3 tests. A visual analysis paper that should not be an issue if you spend some time on it. There might be a lot of material to memorize but Bvb curves a lot.", "She is very dedicated to helping other, and will meet you after class if she has time. Very friendly.", "I love her! She keeps all of her students engaged in what they're learning, and she's SO funny. Definitely one of my favorite professors. Do everything you can to take her! She grades papers super easily, and doesn't give a lot of tedious work. But don't buy the textbook. I have never used mine.", "Prof was rude and condescending. Asked for help on multiple occasions and felt like she was annoyed that I had any questions in an online course. She did not communicate effectively and gave short notice of deadline changes. Overall the class was neither challenging nor helpful and was generally unpleasant. Would not recommend.", "The class isn't that bad but she isn't the best professor. The whole class is having groups teach a chapter. This is fine but she interrupts a lot during presentations and doesn't let the group complete what they were saying.", "I love this class. You have to make sure you practice outside of class. Its not too bad you might be able to make it by a few times without practicing because she works with you a lot. I love her she if fun and funny and... dare I say it not too bad to look at LOL. If your not good with piano take her class she is great at teaching", "This professor is confusing to say the least. Essays questions are VERY unclear and she will not budge a millimeter when grading. If you want to get an A you need to write a turn paper for every assignment. I took this class to fill upper level class requirements and it turned into a nightmare. I am a very good student but she is so condescending!", "This is the best professor to take if you are not a biology major...she understands that the class is not made up of majors and presents the material a way that is easily understandable. The class is sometimes boring but attendance is not mandatory...I would highly reccommend the professor for Biology class", "this class was ridiculously easy. just do the homework ahead of time so that you can ask her questions. the tests are simple", "!!!", "Great professor. Great class. Interesting subject matter. Pick a good TA, or the recitation is worthless. But, Aurora does a great job on her own. The people that complain are lazy.", "She is awesome. if you do your work and come to class you will do fine. she truly cares about her students. Seton Hall needs more professors like her. Don't listen to the person who said \"awful\" because they are the type that probably didnt do the work and still expected an A.", "My entire life has changed because of this professor. He gets inside you so deep and brings out strengths and talents, not to mention ideas, you never knew you had. No one has ever had such a profound and positive effect on me.", "Excellent teacher in online courses. As long as you asked questions, she would help you out. I made an A after being out of Math for 10 years. I strongly recommend her if Math is not a good subject for you.", "She's a very tough grader. She wants essays done very specifically to the style of her liking, and she's not very clear about exactly what she wants. She is somewhat helpful.", "Not a terribly hard teacher, or one that will change the way you think, but it's nice to have a class every once in awhile that's simple and straight forward.", "She was ok, but I heard that she selects students to stay after class to watch her grade tests.", "It is a pretty easy class. She gives you exactly what you need to know on the tests. As long as you attend class and take good notes you will pass the class.", "THIS IS 1 OF THE WORSE PROFESSORS I'VE EVER HAD SINCE IVE BEEN AT JOHN JAY. SHE'S MEAN AND DID NOT TREAT ME WITH RESPECT. IN MY OPINION SHE PLAYS FAVORTISM. HOW COULD FAIL THE DAMN CLASS WITH PASSING THE FINAL AND PAPER AND AT LEAST PASSING SOME OF HER WORTHLESS QUIZZES. IF YOU HATE READING..I ADVISE YOU TO NOT TAKE HER.", "is a good prof, has good notes for class, but tuff marker for tests.", "She was an amazing professor. Lectures go by very fast, and almost all of the time you are out of class 30-45 minutes early. She got to know all of her students.

I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot. Thank you professor Adams.", "she is super sweet and is very willing to work with you! great class!", "amazinggg teacher. made class so much fun and it was worth going to so early in the morning.", "Hard marker on long answer. Exams are tough. Apparently she is a feminist...but never really found that", "There is a lot to learn in this class if you show up. Attendace policy is strict and the projects are time consuming....not hard...time consuming.", "She was a very nice person, but not a good teacher. Do all the homeworks, study for the written exams, go into the oral exams with a conversation in mind and just manhandle it so she doesn't ask you vocab. Annoying to attend because SOO boring.", "Like most courses and professors, you will only get as much out of this as you intend to. If you really need help, you need to ask and help will be given etc. Regarding personality Professor Hood is quirky and keeps things fresh, to say the least. Drive and interest are key motivators to understand and do well because the material can be dense.", "Challenging but fun PE class. Great teacher.", "Take this class!", "if your gonna do ANT she is the teacher to go with. her passion for the subject shines through her teaching making me care about the subject. her teaching style grabs attention and is easily understood. you will need to read guns, germs, and steel but because she broke it down weekly, its not as painful.", "Thought this class was easy as long as you go to class. Just the paper and the presentation is your grades. She literally tells you exactly what to put in the paper if you go to class. Would've gotten an A But I used an outline during the presentation", "Awesome class. I took it online and learned a lot. She grades fast and is very fair. She doesn't accept late work so if you are for that pick another professor. As long as you do what is expected and try hard you will do well. I loved this class and I found Professor Foster to be super fair. What you learn you will utilize in everyday life.", "She is very helpful. Pay attention to deadlines and participate, and you'll have no problems.", "She was an okay teacher. The only thing I had a problem with was that I received an 89.75 and she wouldn't even make it an A which I thought was a little ridiculous considering it is only 0.25 points and she would not round it up. Considering other teachers would raise your grade a whole point to give you an A she couldn't even round it up.", "She is so much fun!!! She's hilarious. She is very good and picking up the mood of the classroom and if she isn't feeling well or if she could tell the class was just in one of those, 'I want to go home' moods she would totally let class out. She gives study guides for tests and goes over them in class.", "Elle Feth is awful. Her lectures are not only boring, but incredibly complicated and far too detailed. The tests and assignments are easy, but in the end, you'll end up regretting taking the course. The testa are straightforward, however, she uses confusing language and will not clarify. Do NOT take this course with her.", "She's awsome! She listens to what you have to say without critisizing and is truly interested in what she is teaching. The class is a breeze and her lectures are actually interesting!", "Alright", "She spent far too much time writing code on the board. Julie Lutter uses that same technique. It is to far out of date to be used at NAIT. Never really knew what I was supposed to do. Was lost by the time lab1 was out even though I got +90% on quiz 1.", "For Intermediate Fin 1... Shes solid, knows her stuff, goes at a good pace and exams are fair. She preps you well for the exams.", "Took Dr. Douglas Developmental Psychology during the summer and it was super easy.

Thank you so much.", "She did not have grades uploaded on blackboard until the semester was over. She told us 2 weeks before school let out that we could make up assignments but at the time i had all 100s then i look on after the semester ends and shes added lots of grades that are like 40s and 60s.I would have done some of that make up work if those grades we uploaded", "She is a pretty good teacher and is very fair, although that may hurt some people.

I would not suggest her unless you think u can turn in EVERY assignment be on time to EVERY class and never EVER miss a class", "Awesome teacher, very intelligent", "No class will ever be harder than this. It is not difficult subject matter at all, but the format is bizarre and every point matters. The lab manual is full of typos and straight errors. The quizzes are over the most obscure parts of the lab manuals. Come to lab organized, study for quizzes, and don't forget LON-CAPA and you will be fine.", "I had fun in her class, and suprisingly enjoy the essay part. Make sure you stay on schedule with the essays because they can be overwhelming if you become behind. Her personality is very interesting; she can be a little airheaded at times and just laugh at her jokes as if they are actually funny!", "Organized professor, very nice lady, and very understanding. Easy A if you attend class and put forth the effort. Learned a lot I have never known before. Would recommend if you were to take the class.", "easy easy easy... if you fail this class it is simply because you really did not try.

I really lucked out!", "If you do not like to be picked out in front of everyone do not take the class. She has favorites and uses them to demonstrate and calls them out. It can get very frustrating.", "Great teacher..Outlines due mondays..20 question midterm plus extra credit. 25 question final plus extra credit and..1 presentation..EASY!!", "Her class was simple. So simple it was completely boring. Everything is common sense and nothing deeper. If you want a simple class that is uninspiring then it might work for you.

Very boring but worth the time for an A", "pretty good", "Dr. Iten loves to complicate everything. She also loves to waste time on clicker questions.

Great woman.", "Best professor i have ever had, if had a chance, please take a class with her", "Really wen into this class thinking it was going to be nightmare. She is stern and can be intimidating at times but she is fair. Tests are right from lecture and textbook. Study and there would be no reason you will fail. There were multiple curves given to offset the questions that many students got wrong. Overall great lecturer and fair teacher.", "She's a very tough grader in regards to grammar. She is enjoyable though.", "I liked the course more than I liked the professor. Professor Lape rarely updated announcements, gave no feedback on anything, was not professional with her email responses, she did not help me much with anything really, and she was too subjective with a lot of things. The class was pretty easy, but she barely did anything all semester!", "I just loved her, the best professor I ever had. She has so much enthusiasm and created such a pleasant environment. She even hosted a party at the end of the year for our class. The very best at STU!!", "Very nice but not a great prof. You spend the whole class trying to write down notes from the overhead (while she talks about someting else) before she whips them away. Tests are way too long for the amount of time given - don't take this class if you're looking for an easy A!", "This is the worst teacher I have had in my 2 years as a full time student at L.C.C.

She is completely ignorant and the other psych profs I have had at LCC have agreed that she is a bad pro", "I loved Cynthia and the way she taught her class. She lets you know she's there for you the whole way through. You definitely won't float through cell biology because it's not an easy subject but if you do the work as she suggests and participate in class you'll be fine. She's so passionate about what she teaches, a truly awesome professor.", "I tried going to her office for help. She asked me questions, then I tried to answer them but got them wrong. She then said I needed to get help. Um, that's what I was there for. She has a difficult language barrier. No matter how much I did, I could not pass. Who grades homework anymore? That did nothing but have my grade go lower and lower.", "Very knowledgeable! good pace!", "Attendance is absolutely mandatory. She does not put the power points online which kind of stinks. Her tests are hard, and require a lot of studying. Nice lady though.", "Grades students' work against each other, NOT against a rubric. Has student groups teach subjects for her...and that's the highlight of the course. Class only covers the easiest theories that you'll learn better in other comm classes. Super easy workload. Don't think/try and you'll be fine. This course is about pleasing her, so just play her game.", "I like this teacher. She really wants her students to understand the math.She is extremely helpful. I dislike math very much but she got me through it. I was very bored most of the time however, but that is not her fault just the math.", "Lots of books to buy for this class but they are all less then ten dollars. Sometimes less then 5 or free cause some are on amazon. If you are a person who does their work last minute all the time, dont take the class.

I really feel sad about the kids who did not understand her jokes - particularly since most of them are Psych majors, who will likely go on to deal with children.

So not approachable", "In the beginning of the course u'll find her difficult, but tht's when u r wrong....She's of great help....U have just 1 final and some quizzes....She gives homeworks, but they are damn easy and short......She was great and i took her back to back for 101 & 102...TAKE HER for an easy A", "Knows her topic. The best.", "Unhelpfull and just not interested in student's", "Dr. White has a very outspoken personality. If she sees you sleeping or daydreaming, she will call you out.

Was confused a lot of the time and not sure how all topics related to each other, but her class is set up pretty clearly. She gives reviews the class before the test and is pretty much exactly what's on it. The prompts are hard to grasp for papers, but I never got lower than an 87% on one. I'd recommend still.", "Worst teacher! Her method is very dry and boring, you do not actually learn anything. She actually made me hate art. Easy class, just read the book and zone her out if you must take it with her. I would advise against it. Plus she's a real jerk, to a lot of students over the smallest things, like being 20 seconds late. NO JOKE.", "Absolutely AWFUL, She is the most horrible teacher and has a dumbass aid jerod who cannot hear and marked people absent when they weren't. Biggest waste of time she should be FIRED!!!", "She is the worst teacher ever. Shes old a senile and not very helpful. Shes a photographer of Architecture not an architect, therefore she doesnt know much about actual architecture.", "She is an EXCELLENT! teacher. She makes all students prove and present proofs.

Very understanding and kind as a person, BUT she marks so freaking hard. *groans* And she expects you to show up for EVERY class and puts you on the spot.

If you show effort, she will help you out as much as possible. Truly cares about students. I recommend!", "Yeah, I agree with what the previous student posted on Manatu. You do NOT want to get on her bad side. Do all 3 speeches required for the semester (Mini Intro, Informative & Persuasive speeches), ace the Mid-Term & Final & you'll be alright. Oh yeah, do give her feedback because she expects it. She'll go nuts if no one respond back with feedback.", "Cynthia is an awesome instructor!! I am sad this will be my last class with her!

Her lectures are interesting, and labs are so much fun!", "Adorable!", "Devote your life to her class, work hard, make many sacrifices and you will still not smell the paradise of an A. Only thing I liked about her class was before the research project.", "A wonderful teacher. Shes always willing to go out of her way to help whether its on a one to one basis or in a group. Her teaching style is different, but she manages to get you to think independently and question ideas rather than just mindlessly recalling stuff from memorization. Take her class, its worth the work.", "I took the 8 week course online. Pro.Jost gives a test review for midterm and final you look up answers on your own, this only covers 60% of exam. Expect a lack of communication and late grading.", "Class is interesting regardless of prof, but she is sometimes difficult to follow with her accent (not her fault). Class is easy if u go to txtbook website (book itself is not really necessary).", "Zahajko was the worst instructor I have ever had.

I agree though, yes, she's a good prof. too.", "If you are a student who has been away from school for an extended time, I highly recommend that you do not take this instructor.

U would understand if u took the class.", "Good professor, there to help, clear and fair.", "She is really sweet but a bit quirky and made the classes fun!", "she is probably the easist teacher you can get.

It's pretty easy as long as you show up and pay attention.", "average teacher. would not take again, fair grader.", "She is kind of a hippie but none the less as long as you attend and are involved you will get a good grade!", "She's scatterbrained at times but she knows what she is doing. You'll come out of her classes knowing a lot more than when you came in. You just have to be willing to do the work and there is a lot of it. If you have a good attitude about the class you'll get an A.", "I don't know what NYU students who complain about the difficulty of a given class expect from their education. It's one thing to recognize a challenge but quite another to characterize such rigor as a shortcoming of the professor. Sue Collins is an excellent prof. who fairly challenges her students. Lazy individuals-please spare us your thoughts!", "Feedback was good, though I had to have \"tracking changes\" in Word explained to me. Pretty good for an online class. Lots of reading, but I expected that because of the subject. I always got a fast response to my questions.", "this teacher sucks so bad- i would RUN away if you are thinking about taking her- she is ****ing retarded- wont help you and grading system is completely unfair- do yourself a favor and dont take her EVER!", "Dr. Newhart is a wonderful lady but this course is a bore. There's a lot of busy work and class can get boring very fast. She is a sweet lady though, and sometimes can be fun. She laughs about everything...There's a lot of class participation but none of the material is that hard to grasp if you do the homework (or at least some of it).", "Took this professor's auditing class. This was the only class in the entire program I c received a grade below B- because he didn't teach anything and tested you on everything. I personally complained to the dean multiple times and was told he was tenured and nothing could be done to him. Waste of tuition! Seek another professor if you can.", "a great professor!", "She is kind of hard but you can make a B if you do all the assignments. When writting a paper start on it early and you will do good in her class.", "Not a bad teacher, but it wa kinda hard to understand what she was tring to say sometimes due to the language barrier. Also she had an odd ordering of theaching, she taught us a lot of stuff we may never use.", "The best professor I have had in Gettysburg - so inspiring, so clear, so helpful.", "Very vague and not specific as to what requirements are in regards to assignements", "I took the hybrid version with Feth and have no regrets! Show up for every lab for easy points and keep up on your reading and powerpoints. Tests were straight from the material.", "Nancy would ask us to explain some phenomenon, and we would always say \"shielding\" (which was the correct but lazy answer in every case), and she got wise and started requiring us to defend that answer. Since then I've never given an answer I couldn't defend, in any medium, on any topic. 4 instead of 5 for defriending me on Facebook.", "excellent", "she seems nice and sweet, but shde is really not, very unclear about research, useless class at all, just need it because it looks good on transcript, total waste of time.", "difficult to relate to...intense personality...instructional nightmare", "Good teacher. Very funny, however she does tend get off topic. She doesnt give any homework..but if no one reads the material prior to class, then she'll start. There's only one research paper and 3 test. She can be a bit sarcastic but I found her to be hilarious. I take her again in a heartbeat. Just make you study and be on time.", "I took Professor Usyk as my lab professor at Stockton College and she was horrible. She doesn't care about her students, doesn't teach in class or help with labs. She gives really tough quizzes and doesn't give you a grade until after the semester is over. Do NOT take her, whatever you do.", "good", "I really have to contradict the earlier posting. I don't think the person was actually writing about Gessner. She does teach. She does not read things verbatim from the textbook!!! She is very interesting and kept her students engaged and interested. Moreover, she was the best instructor I had this semester.", "She is too narrow-minded to entertain students' comments, too lazy to \"teach\" a course with professional lectures, and gets away sitting on her behind for hours every class day watching the same movies. My final paper was more than exemplary and she couldn't see past her ignorance to appreciate its awesomeness.", "Dont take any of her classes!!", "No Comments", "She is awesome, read the readings, participate a little and you'll do fine. She is so chill, her discussions are awesome even though we always get off topic. I really loved this core class with her. She is a bit flakey and is late to most things, but she's still awesome.", "Great Professor. She is really helpful and knows how to teach Spanish real well. As long as you come to class and do the assignments you will do well. I highly recommend her.", "Nearly everything she does in class appears to be taken right from the textbook. She teaches by simply doing example after example and doesn't really explain the concept by talking but rather does lots of examples in order for you to understand which wasn't bad. If you study the tests and quizzes can be quite easy.", "Can use book/internet/whatever on exams. Check BB before class, cancels frequently. Also, dismisses early every day until end of semester. Child Development was an easy class with her. It's an easy A if you know how to write papers well enough.", "Cynthia is AWESOME!! I never write these reviews but I wanted to for this class because she is fabulous! She actually makes the subject material make sense! She has a real passion for what she teaches! Shes very prompt at answering emails and is EXTREMELY helpful!! I am hoping to have her again as an instructor!", "Does not teach. Reads things things verbatim from the text book. Does not elaborate at all Explainations seem to consistantly be circular. Does nothing to hold students interest. It is absolutely painful having to sit through her class. I would not wish this professor on anyone. Hands down, the WORST instructor I have ever had. Easy tests etc.", "Dr. Gifford is one of FAU's better teachers. She is very approachable and clear. There were no tests, only a group project which was not so bad. There are a couple of reader-response assignments and an 8 page paper at the end of the semester. It was a very interesting class and if you have to take it, you will not regret taking her class.", "Awful professor...I could teach the class better than her. Avoid like the plague.", "Very nice person. If you do the work/reading, you will be fine.", "Made the class interesting. Even enjoyed Oedipus, but no body can help Othello. She helped me to understand and enjoy English. I think she's a fantastic teacher and would take her again in a heart beat. Test are tuff though, ya have to read the material and study. Always an essay, but if you study you'll get it. And she is hot!!!", "Lana Carnes is rude and is now over the marketing department. If you have any problems with your teachers, go straight to the dean and bypass her. She is unhelpful and judgemental. She will also take the side of her teachers even if you provide evidence of grade discrimination.", "I like this professor. She is clear in the class and willing to help students who do not understand. ACC220 itself is a hard course. You need to pay attention. If you show up every time and ask questions, you will get an \"A\".", "Concordia needs more profesors like Dr. Maille.", "Be prepared to read over 100 pages a week along with all of your other classes. Also be prepared to write very detailed essays. Don't think you're gonna get by with anything to basic. This is a 2000 class so the fact that she requires such detailed writing is kind of ridiculous. The difficulty of this class rivals many of my upper division courses.", "she seems to really care about her students and to enjoy what she does. my writing has really improved after taking her class.", "ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. This quarter's been stressful AF. Her online class is SO disorganized. She grades essays strictly by format. She's so f* useless, I could learn more from a brick wall that from her. I felt like I was begging for help to no avail. Students that either were interested in learning or at least want a fair teacher, AVOID.", "Excellent teacher. Treats everyone fair. She doesn't have pets, and she seems to really enjoy teaching.", "Professor Amdur is one of the greatest teachers. His inspiring, thought-provoking discussions about leadership were invaluable.", "Dr. Fressola was absolutely awesome.If you were in her class you walked a straight line. At the same time, I saw the passion she had for teaching, and nursing as well. Today, 12 years after my nursing ceremony at Bergen, I thank her for being who she is, and for believing in me. Thank you.Dr. Fressola. She was simply marvelous!", "Waterhouse is a very nice person. And, to be honest you don't do much work in her class. You don't have to read the plays...take notes in class and you will be fine. 2 finals and a paper is all your grade consists of. But if you work hard you will get a good grade.", "Easy class but she is rude, not helpful at all, tells you your answer is wrong and let's that be that. The lectures can be a bit confusing but the math is not hard to comprehend. Take her if you feel comfortable with the subject/ must take it, but she is kind of awful.", "LOVE! She is definitely the best professor I've had at Denison. She is super interested in the material and gets you interested even when the material can be very tedious. Great class I'd suggest her to any and all students. Side note I liked her so much I made her my advisor and she teaches the farthest thing from my major.", "I took this class for an 8 week semester. I'm pretty good with Microsoft Office in general, so this class was pretty easy. Plus, Herbert is very nice and everything is very clear. I even emailed her and asked if she would open a couple tests up early so I wouldn't have to take it finals week, and she totally understood and opened them up!", "She was by far one of my fav professors in first semester. Very helpful. If you do the homework and pay attention in class you will get an A. She's the best.", "Judy is such an amazing lady and all who have commented here don't know what they're talking about. This was my second class with her and I feel as though I have taken so much out of both classes. She really allows you to be creative and everyone's opinion means the world to her. She truly means well & its noticable how much she cares.", "Very unclear about her expectations of assignments and rambles on in class never coming to a point. Her helper that came to class had to interpret everything after Burga said it.", "Didnt respond to emails quickly at all. I had to go out of town for a family emergency and asked to take a proctered test from my laptop but she said NO so i failed the midterm for reasons out of my control. I still passed her class but she was not very helpfull OR sympathetic towards my situation at all. Not a good online teacher to take.", "She made it easy to give speeches in class. Loved how she made us do warmups on speech day.", "Had her for Intro & Int. Jazz.Absolutely loved her! Been dancing my whole life and I know a good teacher when I have one. Takes time to correct you individually and answer any questions, very encouraging as well. Caters to all levels as well. Some readings and short papers, but very easy. Attendence and proper attitude is a must though.", "She'll make you work, but she marks fair and communicates clearly in her lectures. You won't do well if you slack off, but if you are interested in the topic, you'll definitely learn.", "April is a good teacher. Her being deaf forces us to better learn sign language so that we can ask her questions, know our assignments, and have any possibility of doing well on tests. The ASL Lab is boring though... but April is very helpful.", "She is a great Professor. Plus she has the physical features that we make sure that you come to class everyday. Last semester she came to class is a short skirt....OMG!!!", "The best preparation for MCAT's (biology section(", "Brenda Adams is a great teacher. She is very helpful and understanding. Always willing to help everyone.", "I learned a lot just from talking with her, she's very inspirational! She is one of my fave teachers and I recommend her for computer classes. She was super caring and would answer any questions you had. I passed this class with an A, just do the work and you will pass no doubt. I loved her though, she's super sweet!", "Teacher has a great attitude and is very helpful but many times is disorganized and assigns reading that you simply will not have time to do. You must go to her and ask specifically what will be on the test because if you do ALL the readings she assigns, you will literally have no other time for any other classes. Syllabus is sometimes a mess.", "Unable to follow a thought,or keep a question in mind while answering. Uses 'panels,' completely ineffective b/c she asks nonsensical questions ('what is a winning con. arg circa 1800?'). Most reading is not useful, and reiterates the same point over and OVER. She doesn't listen to student responses in class + tries to pick fights. RUN!!!", "Awful professor; no clear plan and disorganized. Take too long to grade papers. Stay away if you can!", "Dr. Siegfried is the bomb. Her class goes beyond the text; I'm still using principles she taught me a year later, and I always will. It's a load of work, but worth it. Read, listen, participate, and you'll get a good grade.", "Her class is really interesting, and its sucks that its early in the morning because its easy to fall asleep...but her class is interesting and shes really funny. Her tests aren't that difficult if you keep up with your work.", "A very Straight forward person and explains stuff properly.A nice teacher overall.", "She was a very fair teacher. Don't expect her class to be super easy just because she is pretty. Don't expect to do well if you don't read/don't retain what you've read. She is very specific about what will be on the tests/ papers and is very easy to talk to if you're confused. No reason why you shouldn't do well if you put forth effort.", "TONS of readings! And she often goes off on random rants about life. This quarter her favorite lines are \"Don't be Spongebobs! Or Walking Dead!\" Sometimes going to lecture is totally useless. But then there are other times when she is focused and actually explains/clarifies the readings.", "She is literally THE BEST. She wants her students to succeed and wants you to get the best grade possible in her class. She does one on one conferences when it comes to midterms and your final paper. And she doesn't do a finals test! Your last research paper is your final and you finish the class a week early! Definitely has been my favorite.", "She made chemistry easy and understandable. I'm disappointed that she isn't teaching CHM 112", "If you dont take this class with her, you are missing out on so much! Class participation is a must, so be prepared to do whatever wacky thing she tells you. Do ALL the assignments. She's not a push over, but she's not mean either. She's tough, but so sweet at the same time. Take this class WITH McAfee!!! You will not regret it.", "brutal prof ...lectures were SOOO boring ..the course itself wasn't that bad but she made it super boring! Vanessa the seminar leader ROCKED thou!!", "i would definitely recommend taking her class. she realy knows her stuff and is pretty kick back. tests and quizzes were challenging so go to class!", "Horrible experience. I have never had a teacher who hated my work as much as Dr. Tenger did. I tried my hardest to understand what she wanted in her papers, but never could. Prime example: I went and talked to her, did EVERYTHING like she told me to, and still got a C. Wasn't worth my time.", "It will all depends on what you are in for . If you need to learn something i will highly recommend her , if you still live in the high school bubble stay away . She will make fun of you . This professor helped me a lot and actually respect her students. She is also great on the human level.", "The one bad part is an expensive CD. But, we could drop 2 of 4 quizzes, bring in a few pictures of work into the tests, email for notes if we miss class, and do lots of extra credit. No readings, and class prepares you for tests.", "One of hardest working professors at Ball State. Always very helpful with questions you may have, and grades assignments very fast. She makes an active effort to get her students interested in IS and the course. Always responds to emails very quickly. Attendance is mandatory, but every student should have her as a prof before graduation.", "ehh. not too bad. not too exciting either. projects are a pain.", "Although she is very nice and approachable, she mumbles, not talks, VERY fast, and gets off topic easily ... no overhead notes or powerpoint presentations, which make lectures unclear and difficult to follow/understand", "The best teacher ever. Her explanations are great and very clear. She is very nice and knows that you need plenty of examples to understand the material. All she does are examples in class which is the only way, in my opinion, that math should be taught. Go over her past practice exams, very very similar.", "She was incredibly unhelpful. Does not care about the difficulty or amount of effort put into your final project. She plays her phone messages from her boyfriend really loud so the students will hear them and think she's cool. Very tacky.", "Need to get sophomore English out of the way? This class is a really great way to do it in 6 weeks over the summer. It's a lot less stress to write many short, not style heavy papers over the traditional long paper. You'll have fun and get to meet others through interaction and discussion unlike the normal class.", "She was extremely helpful. She is the best professor, I have ever had. Even though Dr. Dogru didn't teach in a style I was used to, she tried very hard to help her students understand the material (not just how to solve the problems). I would definitely recommend her.", "Very nice lady and she means well. But for me,her explanations weren't clear & understanding what she was teaching was difficult. Do tons of practice problems,watch PatrickJMT tutorials on youtube,& go to tutoring in the math center. Just don't take her in the summer. Midterm & final were very similar to practice tests available.", "I have taken three classes from professor Murphy-Lee at UW-Milwaukee and absolutely love her! As long as you attend class and do the readings this class will be easy peasy! She literally goes over word for word the answers you will need to write your papers and take your exams. She will help you endlessly so long as you ask. Definitely recommend!", "This professor is probably the worst history professor I have ever had. Her lectures are all over the place and carry little to no structure. I'm a straight a student and I'm taking this class just for the credit. So many people would send one friend to sign the attendance for them. Make this review the reason you don't sign up for her class.", "Very hard marker and will fail you for no real reason. You can spend nights doing a project, and she won't give a jack.", "unless you are going into a class that she teaches knowing all the material like you have your PHD in the subject, expect to struggle. lots of grades which is helpful, but grading isn't based on right/wrong. its what she wants to answer to be in her opinion. TA is just like her, very rude and makes you feel dumb.", "not bad.", "No Comments", "Need to show up to class. She gives random participation days and takes attendance every day. Reports are easy as long as you skim the material.", "No Comments", "She has ok teaching style but her grading is absolutely horrible - I have a 79% and she still give me a C. Mostly it is the TA who grades the materials and she doesn't even care about your grade. AVOID IF POSSIBLE!", "Pretty crazy, had favorites, randomly collected homework which she spends half of class going over, i don't recommend her", "Brutal workload based around unclear prompts led by unhelpful instruction. The papers felt entirely unrelated to the course material. I had to fight and scrape for my mediocre grade and I had one of the better grades in the class. When half of your students are bombing, it might not entirely be their fault.", "Talk about the easiest class ever! But not only is it easy, but I found it to be quite interesting. If she assigns a paper the class has a discussion about it so that everyone is on the same page. She is an enjoyable lady. I think this is the easiest A-1 category class there is! Take this class!!!", "Great teacher. Really connects with the class and makes any topic enjoyable. Does require some work here and there, but it is worth it to have her as a professor. Just do your work and go to class and you will get an A.", "Recommend not to take her. It takes forever to get grades back and you can forget about e-mailing her, sometimes she never replied back. Very rude and unorganized.", "The professor did not explain the materials properly. Her quizzes were based on a book full of errors and she did not assist anyone in finding the answers. How she can teach at this school and take me money is ludicrous.", "I honestly loved this class. If you're interested in learning english, I recommend her. If your taking it just to get it over with, I still recommend her because she is there to help you if you need it and the work is more than manageable.", "I am smarter than she is. She has a very little vocabulary. She is sarcastic in an annoying way. She should do students a favor by quitting.", "She is nice, but does not teach in any kind of reasonable way.", "She was very passionate about her teaching. She always tell you what would be on her tests. Attendance sometimes is required in order to know what is going on in the class surrounding. She is very kind and helpful. Not a lot of homework in her class, though. Easy A.", "really cool teacher. she is very passionate about the subject and her class is somewhat enjoyable. her grading is difficult but if you put time into it she will give you a good grade", "Superb professor. Very helpful and inspirational. If you pay attention and work hard in and out of class you can and should be a better speaker by the end. Sadly, only four speeches. There were some tape recorded assignments, some paper assignments, quizzes and two tests. Paper work is cake if you study. Study, practice, practice, study, practice.", "this woman is so amazing and nice. very friendly and will even email you notes or extend deadlines even if your excuse is because you woke up late or are too lazy to do it on time. the class however is so boring and depressing. exams are easy if you study the notes and memorize the slide names and artists", "She's nice enough, goes over a lot examples, a LOT of times. there's entire class days devoted just for practice before tests. The only thing I hate is that she USES WILEY A lot and those darn quizzes sneakup on you.Take em early! I hate teachers that are lazy/depend on websites to \"keep track\" /grade quizzes,AS sometimes the website WAS WRONG!", "Ms Adams was a kind teacher. She tried to improve her slides from the previous semester to spruce things up. Her lectures can be a bit dull if you know the material already, but she is a helpful and encouraging teacher. She has patience and the eagerness to help you pass.", "She only does the easy problems on the board & when u get the worksheet u don't know what to do. The test r harder than anything she teaches. She closes her eyes when she lectures and has an attitude sometimes. She's also very impersonal. Don't take her class 'cause u will fail. She makes her assistant wait outside till the end of class like a dog.", "Good teacher. Might not be around very long though, I hear she's going to be murdered by the ghost of President Nixon.", "Carla is a straight up G. She loves the material, and loves seeing students dive in and excel. With that being said, she's a babe and a half.", "Awesome teacher. She is so full of passion.", "Probably one of the best educational experiences I've ever had. I wanted to applaud after every lecture. Great teacher if you actually give a crap about trying to learn the material.", "Dr. Jones is the best teacher ever!", "she is ok as teacher nothing great. i did hate dgoing to class because she is fake. you can tell by the tone of her voice when she speaks its a put on. she also needs to realize that comm is a required course and not everyones major, so comm is not my life. chem is a little more important tan comm to some people.", "This Professor Is useless, had her for the online portion of Micro, and it was HELL!!! you don't know whats going to be on the test, and it an online class but you do all the test in Labs + lab test, and she doesn't put your grades up on blackboard after the test. DON'T TAKE HER, RUN!!!!", "She sometimes has no idea what she is talking about. All she does is read off her PowerPoint slide. She is really nice and sweet but she cannot teach. She is not very clear about what she is talking about and goes off topic. the only thing i liked about her class were the chocolates she brought for the class and her easiness on extensions.", "No Comments", "Very sweet, a little absent minded sometimes but to a minimal degree without too much interference to her teaching. Her critiques were nice because she could usually point out a projects merits but balance it with constructive criticism. You'll enjoy her class if you enjoy a lot creative freedom.", "She wrote the book...so guess what... you'll be buying it, however, you will only read about 20 pages...so buy it from a student who took the class last semester. Not the best teacher I ever had, but not the worst teacher either. Very intelligent woman.", "Eleanor intimidated the hell out of me when I first had her. She's smart, can defend her views, and expects the same out of you. Beware the eyebrow of death. Once I got to know her she was charming, warm, and blindingly intelligent. Though she focuses on race, I never felt I was evil for being white or that I was graded down for disagreeing.", "She's very helpful in labs....Very approachable... Easy to talk to.. Explains very nicely.", "Talks about her sexual actions and sex WAY too much.", "I like her a lot. She's very helpful.", "She was rude and arrogant, and cared way too much about the LART program. She scoffed at anyone who had a differing opinion about that class. The information was pointless, yet we did SO MUCH WORK.", "No Comments", "This class has A LOT of reading so be prepared to stay up to date on the homework, but everything assigned is very interesting. She is good at grading and responding to messages in a reasonable time. I genuinely learned a lot from this class!", "Tabitha is stict and pretty dense on the material. She obviously knows what she's talking about but she moves really fast though her lectures, leaving the class scrambling to jot everything down. Her quote ID's are obscure and difficult to succeed in without memorizing the whole text. But she is a fair marker in other regards.", "She's a great teacher and keeps the subject matter interesting!", "Soooo nice, really cares about what the students have to say, and sooo helpful and understanding. Her passion for what she teachers makes you interested in the subject, even if you weren't before the class. Def recommend her, take her if you get the chance. She awesome!", "Horrible!! Poor lecture skills. Poor interpersonal skills. Finds favorites (Which i was one of) and takes care of those select few. Everyone else is left on their own and is frequently harrassed in class. Never enroll for her courses; unless you enjoy pain.", "Easiest course ever just watched movies and compared them. Had a multiple midterm and essay exam and you get 30 percent for showing up.", "One of the best professors to pick up as a Freshman. She understands kids, and she is a very good teacher who makes psychology interesting.", "shes ok but very sarcastic and never smiles she gives lots of works and never helps you. she stressed you out.", "This class is super easy, but you won't learn a thing. Actually I am pretty sure my writing got worse as the quarter progressed because I was able to completely blow off all the assignments until a few hours before they were due and still get 80-90% on the papers.", "She requires a lot from the students. A lot of reading and writing even for a regular comp lit class. However, she is very nice and is a fair grader.", "Her class is awful. Hardest marker i've ever had, very boring lecture. And don't disagree with her ideas when writing a paper. You'll get an F. She'll say you're reaching from the text. Avoid her class.", "Great person!", "Love! Favorite teacher ever. She is the sweetest. Organized classes and notes. Cares for her students. Easy to approach and talk with. Her tests are easy if you take good notes during class!", "No Comments", "Fun teacher. Just study for her two tests and take all her advice for your speeches.", "You rock Odette!! :)", "Personally, with most psychology classes I forget the material after a semester, but I feel Dr. Asplin's class if very different.

She doesn't know how to explain things. And when you ask her questions she seems like she couldn't be bothered.", "Interesting class with great examples of what we are doing to the environment. The stories are great. Challenging but doable. I would highly recommend this course to anybody interested in the saving the world.", "No Comments", "She's great! Class is very relaxed.

Teaches what the class wants to talk about.", "Awesome professor, very organized", "She is really good. If you show your effort, she will pay for you.", "Had Miller for biochem 2. It was more discussion based than lecture. It was bigger concepts than the niddy griddy stuff you learn in Biochem 1. Study and you will do fine.

It was difficult to understand what she wanted at times. Wonderful lady, below average professor.", "Overall I good teacher", "Great Teacher!", "Sweet, elderly lady that is willing to go out of her way to help her students and is always open to suggestions.

Loved the class and would recomend her for any course.", "She is by far my favorite professor here at CMU! She is so nice and is willing to work with you in any given situation. There are quizzes online every week but you can take them until you get 100%. I took this as a writing intensive and there were only 3 short papers so it was a relief. I would definitely recommend her for MUS 114WI!", "don't take her. she is very unclear and boring. the only thing thats good is that you can only go to test day and still get an A", "I think it says something that the positive reviews all have negative user reviews whilst negative reviews have positive user reviews.

Awful role model.", "fair but challenging marker. not an easy course, but she is very knowledgeable and helpful when you need it. difficult to take notes off, however. needs a powerpoint presentation or something", "She is very passionate and involved with her subject - she will help direct you towards your own passion within the subject of Middle East Women's Studies.", "AVOID. I was so excited to take a feminism class, she absolutely ruined it for me. Kept calling cisgender women 'born women' and brushed me off when I brought it up.

She does a really good job at breaking up material to make it easier to understand, but it's easy to fall behind if you miss class. Do the practice problems from the study sheet before the exam.", "This class is really easy. You do an in class assignment and then you do the exact same thing in an application. I reccomend this class to everyone. I missed literally 7 points in the whole entire class and the class has like 2970 points. Plus you learn some great things about excel, word, PowerPoint, and access that will help you in live.", "She is the best teacher everr! Super easy class if you cant pass this class just give up on life! All you do is watch videos all day and on mondays we tak notes which is just vocab. words.

If you want to learn anything about accounting DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! During class he rambles on about pointless stories and tries to cram in the material the last 10 mins of class and expects u to stay after the class is over.

She makes class fun and interesting while teaching.", "she literally will not teach you anything, if you are a comp sci major, i hope you already know how to use java, if you are taking it for credits don't even think about taking this excuse for a professor. you will fail.

Toth is an awesome professor!!!!", "she is a really nice professor and most lectures are pretty intersting. i took female biology and bones bodies and disease. for BBD she tells you to read an emily craig book but its awaste of time there is only one question in the test about it and i got it wrong any ways. you have to write 2 ten page papers", "I took her Class two years ago through online. Biggest mistake I ever made in college! She is horrible and gives too much work. I sometime thought she was an english teacher while getting back the assignments. I dropped out because of the overwhelming work load at her course. If you are taking more than two classes make sure you don't have her.", "She is definitely moody for sure. Her class isn't really that difficult. She's just very strict, like no food and phones on the table. No talking/ whispering when she's talking. Attendance is mandatory. Don't be late. The classwork and assignments is pretty easy.", "Ok, it's not that she laughs at you, is her way even when you are right she laughs, but if you are not good at math don't take her, she expects you to know what you are suppose to know, no extra nothing, what you got is what you are going to get, she won't help you with extra points, she does not encourages you.

Hard but good", "This teacher is very friendly, but the tests are extremely hard and she gives quizzes every single day in the last 10 minutes of class which I found very frustrating, especially at the end of the day after a 2 hour lecture.", "Take this class! She gives you all the homework and tests in advance. You do need to use the book, but only because the answers are right there. You don't need to read it, she gives you the page numbers. The tests aren't hard (open book/internet). There is something due every week, but it's not a lot. And you can work ahead. Recommend this class.", "I'm surprised she is still teaching. Evidently she hasn't improved in the last 30 years. I took a Mexican-American studies class from her in the 1970's. I was very interested in the subject, but I have to say, she was the worst professor I have ever had in my entire academic career. What a miserable, arrogant, condescending person.", "I gave Cynthia some credit for being encouraging but her tests are ridiculously hard and she is not approachable in lab for questions.

It was always very obvious that she loved her subject, loved to teach it, and knew her stuff.", "The most caring teacher I've had.", "Just do all of the required readings and attend lecture; she is essentially the study guide for the exams. Pay attention. She also gives actual study guides that help refresh your memory. If you review, you won't have much trouble for the multiple-choice exams. Participation matters during the discussion period. There are also two 5-7 page essays.", "Dr.Jackson-Jones is highly recommended. She knows so much about her subject;that really amazes me.

If you take her class, I promise you will learn a lot!!!!", "best teacher ever...makes you work hard but it pays off in the end!!! gubacs rules!@", "Professor Brenda Adams class is a class you definitely will not regret taking. Professor Adams is super nice and helpful, really cares about students learning the material. not only that but also to pass the class. For anyone interested in taking this class, i definitely recommend To take the class with Professor Adams.", "Shes a pretty good professor, she gives really good clinical examples when she lectures.

It is unlikely that she will make much of an impression on you, either positive or negative.", "Best professor ever happen to me :D She is nice, and give respectful feedback on every piece of homework you submit. She taught wonderful genetics, and she knows what she is talking about during class. She is also super helpful on projects. I'd definitely recommend her to anyone.", "No exaggeration THE BEST professor I have had at the school. She's approachable (friendly) and intelligent, and can explain herself clearly and concisely. You can tell she enjoys what she does and waht she teaches, and teaches you everything you need to know to be critical and smart too! A MUST-HAVE for the school!", "Dr. Dogru was a good professor in my opinion. She gave very tough tests, but was always fair. The class consists mostly of her handing out packets of the material and were expected to work on it with a group. She walks around and if you got stuck, she could explain it many different ways. She is a very smart woman and rather challenging.", "Very Tough emotionally and knowledge-wise. You MUST study. Find every nlcex book and read them all. Test three..absurd.

Homework and quizzes count double what tests count and if you do bad on a homework assignment you can have your grade drop a lot. iDid bad on one homework assignment, took me from an A to a low C. Nice person and even a decent teacher, but terrible grading system. Avoid her!", "Dr. Sweely is honestly the sweetest professor I have ever had. The class is easy: 2 tests, 2 essays, and an oral report. She doesn't allow you to take notes because she says she \"gives the best study guides in the world.\" Lectures are short and interesting. You only need the textbook to study for midterm and final. I recommend 100%! Love her.", "Wonderful professor. She's smart as a whip and funny too. Material may seem impossible but she makes it easy to digest. attendance is mandatory (you can miss a few days), grades are split between class participation, blog posts, and papers. NO TESTS :)", "this class should not be taken by any normal student at penn state beaver. you need to read and learn to present arguments to things you normally wouldnt think of arguing. she is a brilliant teacher probably one of the best on campus. she is also a very good person to go to for advice because she is very knowledgable on most topics.", "Professor Faunce is a very fair teacher. If you do your work, you'll get an A. Some of her activities may seem very elementary ed, but that's the program, not her!", "She's mediocre at best. Her classes can be fun and are very easy. however, her tests have nothing to do with lectures and she is very picky when it comes to testing and projects. She can be pretty rude and doesn't allow food in the classroom aside of water. She is sweet at times but can be pretty mean that second later. Overall, I got a highly B.", "She is a great teacher, the material was at times hard but she was very clear about the works we studied. she knew a lot about the works and was very helpful. make sure to always read the assignments and start ealry on papers. very good teacher.", "not the most interesting class..just the usuall run over notes and one or two in class assignments..testing is based on what she talks about ..this class is missing something to catch student attention", "She is a great professor.

She won't give you an A, but it's not that hard to earn one.", "I learned so much from taking this class and I really enjoyed it! She gives ppt lectures and provides links to articles and videos to help with the lecture. She truly cares about her students' success. Just do the reading, take notes, keep up with the discussions, and wou will do well in the tests.", "I enjoyed this class. She grades you on your understanding of the material and you will actually learn history. She cares about the experiences of the people in the past and will help if you ask. There are no tests. She does assign a lot of readings but you just have to skim them. You just need a basic understanding of American history.", "WORST. PROFESSOR. OF. ALL. TIME.", "One of the nicest people ever. never gets angry and is quite knowledged in the subject matter. She is very helpful and even though I am horrible at math, I passed with an S.

If you keep up with the online homework everyday, you will do well.", "Dr. Jackson had an extremely arrogant attitude and when asked questions would snap. She was not helpful at all and would make snide remarks that made you think twice before even asking a question. Do whatever you can to avoid this lady.", "I toke her class online. Most of the material I learned was from the text book. Be sure to underline important sentences and paragraphs. You will also need to write a lot, at least 2 1/2 to 5 or 6 pages per each essay assignment. There are two essay assighnments due each week. Follow my guideline and you will get an A in the class, just like I did.", "Professor pam is the best! Super chill and easy class! She's really nice! There are no midterms or finals!

She is always there for you when you need help during office hours, after class, and she is invested in student's success.", "The class really isn't that hard, though the books she chooses are boring. She's kind of ditzy though, and can be boring at times, but she is a fair grader.", "The things that I could say about this woman. I could go on for days. Probably a great nurse in the field, but absolutely neurotic in class. Reads straight from slides; classes are a foray into nightmarish levels of boredom. Tests are a mess of questions pulled from thin air, and you are always guilty of cheating until proven innocent. Seriously.", "Kristine is an alright professor. She can be a little off sometimes and she forgets to put discussion questions up on ICON a lot. For exams, you'll need to focus more on examples rather than the actual definitions. The exams aren't super hard, but I learned the hard way for the first half of the test. : The papers are short (2 to 3 pages), hard.", "SHE'S JOANTASTIC!!!!!!!!", "Passionate teacher. I learned volumes of pertinent information from her. The class is actually fun! I was sorry to see the semester end!", "No Comments", "She is a tough grader. Tough to the point of being borderline unfair. Each project is 100% correct or 100% wrong. If you had an error, no matter how small, you would get a zero. Luckily, she lets you retry the homework you turned in, for a slightly reduced point total. Which you will do a lot.", "not helpful @ all....i wish i can say something nice about her.", "Dr. Dunn is a great teacher but her class is no walk in the park, you really have to study and do your homework or you just won't stay afloat in her class.", "I had this teacher for news writing.

Says she doesn't lecture much, opposite is true.", "this class is unnecessarily hard because I knew that some of the ways we were taught could be much easier just by explain a different way to solve it.

RECOMMENDED.", "I had her back in 1998, in night school. Definetely a \"people person\"; emphasized humanitarian qualities and interpersonal skills. She is a professional counsellor and it shows. Strong feedback; does not simply mark \"right or wrong\"; carefully reads answer and your understanding of concepts. But a few students did not take to her approach.", "The worst art class I have ever taken, and this is harsh since I am an art major and love to write. Constantly unclear and became frustrated when you didn't understand. I asked for extra credit because she wanted to use presentation of mine for future use and she accused me of being manipulative. She grades essays hard despite HER terrible grammar.", "Dr. Mackie is very helpful, and she has a great understanding of Ancient Greek. She also makes sure that all questions, no matter how hair-splitting, are resolved. This can become tedious but is very necessary in a language like Greek.", "All Professors should be so good.

I would definitely take her other classes if I needed to..", "I was very intimidated at first but it wasn't as bad as I thought.

As long as you don't eat or drink something other than water, she will like you. You should NEVER use your phone in her class or she will call you out.

Make sure you come to class because Edmodo is a large part of your grade!", "People seem to either love or hate her.

She did bring in some great speakers, though.", "She seems very nervous when reading her notes word for word. Theres long awkward pauses.

Dont talk to her unless its necessary.", "Also, her handwriting is impossible to read, which causes her to repeat everything she writes down several times.", "Gave too much homework and work in general.

Definitely take her, you won't be disappointed!!", "A little green around the edges. Knows her subject material. Too strick for working with adults.", "Her classes are heavily lecture based.

Definitely take a class from her if you can!", "Mrs. Weeks is very nice, but a little strict on grading papers. The english department made it hard to receive an A in the course (95-100 = A). She is lenient on pushing due dates for papers, but you really have to put effort into the paper itself. She does care for the students but she does want her respect. She has her pet peeves.", "Clarity is not one of her attributes, could be that english is not her first tongue.", "She has the ability to walk into a room and bring silence. She terrifies me, but at the same time, I think she's awesome. I have no doubt she could be mean to some students, but that's because she has really high standards and expects you to work very hard to live up to them. Underneath her exterior, she actually does care about students a lot.", "Prof Perry is a very unorganized but she makes up for it with a lot of extra credit. I can honestly say that if you study what she gives in her study guides then you should be good. She didn't require finals for people who have 96% and above and trust me, I had like a 103% cause of the extra credit.", "the worst teacher at neumann...could not understand her hand writing...not very organized...at one point in the semester she lost my classes papers....can never understand what she is saying...and probably the worst speaking voice of any teacher iv ever had", "This teacher I must say was confusing.

No textbook, everything is online.", "One of those so called teachers that wont go away!", "This is the worst class I've ever take. New language is hard to start. Most of students had learned Spanish in high school but I'm not. She doesn't help me at all. I rather spend time with tutor than spending any miserable second in her class.

Clear guidelines, fair grading, answers emails quickly. Surprised by the bad feedback.", "Dr. Sipple is absolutely amazing! Her discussions are always interesting and never fail to get me thinking.

A grading criteria is given for each assignment but does not display how picky she is so be sure to be very precise when assembling your homework folders. Gives detailed feedback. Very caring. Encourages questions. Lectures are slightly confusing but she spends quite some time clarifying things with you if you ask for help.", "Yes, Dr. Long does give you a lot of homework, but it's worth sticking with.

Her grading is extremely hard and sometimes confusing.", "Intro course, excellent instructor, very helpful and friendly.", "Dr. Albanesi's classes are tough but you learn so much.

I found her class to be rather easy, but she liked my writing style. She is known for grading harshly, but as long as you write basic, organized essays that explain the topic well, she will be generous with grading.", "Ms. Serra teaches the very opposite of other teachers which helps a lot when learning because you actually want to get involved and participate to get that A! Thanks For everything!!!", "This is my favorite professor at UT. I loved her! Anyone who is an English major needs to take her just for the experience. She allows you to love the subject without being a jerk about grades. I actually learned from her.", "Dr. Sweely is my favorite professor so far; she's my hero! Although it's a writing intensive course, there are only 2 short papers, 3 tests, and a 2-minute presentation. There is a textbook but I never felt the need to use it, and found a free pdf of it online.

If you put forth the effort she will help you all she can and you will learn. There is not another English teacher at AC I would even concider sitting under.", "I took this class because it was suposed to be a fun class, and you would learn alot about international business. Dr. Carnes made it not fun. All you do in that class is read the text books, and talk about it. She will put you down if you get the answer wrong. Her tests are hard. I was very disapointed with the class.", "Dona Fletcher grades unfairly. She is closed-minded & isnt willing to accept differing views. I found her docking me points undeservedly. She has a discouraging teaching style & all-around professing for the wrong reasons; she focuses on her intelligence rather than helping students adjust to her style. I strongly discourage you from taking her!", "Ask her about the time she was in high school and got in a fight and ripped off another girls ear...", "Very helpful. Was the key to success for MA240. Would have failed without her.", "Professor O'Shea was an awesome and easy professor. Four papers, 2 tests, and the final which isn't cumulative. She is a pretty easy grader, majority of the class got B'sA's on papers. Class isn't mandatory, she just lectures about the book. So you can just read the book instead. Really easy class, no homework either.", "Nor easy to understand. writting on the board ilegible.Won't answer questions if she thinks you should know.Treats students as subordinates. first quiz equivelent to a final exam before it is taught. She thinks teaching is telling you something.no method", "O'shea is a easy professor is you do all of the online work, she's rude when you try to approach her outside of class. Her power points aren't very helpful, and her lectures do not help at all. Her directions when writing papers are very clear, but it is still difficult to receive a good score on them. The work is all online (quizzes and essays).", "If there are no art majors in the class, she gives pretty easy projects,but if there are, she gets pretty difficult. Also having to write a paper for the midterm and final is a pain. But she is very sweet and nice.", "I'm one of her creative writing students. I love Roberta. She's smart, funny, and sweet and understanding. I'm not in love with the class, always. It's not her fault, it's the class. The talent level varies wildly, and I feel like we focus on the poor writers significantly more. I'd like a higher level of talent in the class.", "Would not recommend her, she takes way to long to respond to questions (online course), and takes even longer to grade assignments. I learned nothing from her, she is a course administrator, not a teacher. Also not flexible with anything. I would keep looking if you want a teacher.", "Cynthia doesn't play, she expects you to pre-read the material before coming to class each day. Then in class she expects participation. She will ask you questions. She tries to guide u to the answer but is often confusing how she does it. She was very helpful outside of class. She seems intimidating but is truly a kind soul. Ask & she will help.", "Fast pace but she is very passionate about what she teaches. She is very helpful, always willing to answer questions students have before and after class.

I have liked every teacher I have had at Neumann, except for her. She is rude and unwilling to help, and she makes no sense whatsoever. The work is hard and she has no desire to help you through the class, I've tried numerous times. Bottom line- stay away from her classes if you can!", "This class was ridiculous. I usually enjoy my PSYC classes and teachers but I cannot say the same for \"Peg\". She is odd, repititive, hard headed and very dull. Just avoid this teacher and you shouldn't have a problem.

LOVES her work and is very passionate about the history of our universe and will help in and out of class until you understand. she explains the material througouly, makes it fun for everyone, and will not give you a day without making you smile.", "She is a very good teacher. She loves the subject. She has a quiz every week but it's like one question and writing your name's already 50% of the quiz! It's boosts up my grade for sure. The exams are pretty easy but I still fail them, lol. Still gives you credit for speaking up in class and she likes it if you sit in the first 5 rows.", "Ok on reg assignments. Her tests are the problem. Seems she wants students to fail. Her exam reviews do not pertain to the test material. She takes the simplest thing and complicates it to the point of confusion. She constantly mispronounces words. All attendance taken within the first 30 seconds of class. Don't be late, will deduct points.", "Took this class online and it was an easy A. If anyone isn't a Psych major and wishes to just knock this class out of the way i would recommend taking online. It saved me alot of time. All you need to do is reply to these forums once a week and you had 3 papers due throughout the whole semester and they were easy! She responds fast to emails.", "The class is interesting and easy. Sheila is a wonderful women and very sweet!", "She's a gpa killer in ISP. You should try to avoid her.", "She does assign a lot of work, but she is very fair. If you do the work (and isn't this why it's called college) and you make an effort, you'll do well. She is very responsive and helpful. I would take her again.", "I agree with the \"chip on the shoulder\" comment. She is abrasive and derives joy from making people uncomfortable. Also, she is biased toward the girls by taking passes late for them and not for the guys...NOT COOL.", "Horrible! Avoid at all costs! Her tests are impossible and this class is very intense for a 100 level class", "One of the worst professors I ever had. She does not respond to emails, which is not good for a professor. Communication is a plus. She is all into herself in class. She does nothing but play on her little computer. She is good at telling you what she want to do when she retire. Good at telling students not to ask her questions, ask a group member.", "I actually would take her again because personally, I've enjoyed writing her papers. I've taken her for ENGL 848 and currently, ENGL 100. Your grade is based on five essays and you can't skip one at all. The topics were easy so writing the papers were a cakewalk. Instructions for essays were straightforward. Basically, just do all of your work.", "Trish is great! I got a good workout of the class, beat my scores on the final fitness test compared to the initial fitness test, and had a wonderful time getting in shape in total body conditioning! I only wish we could have spent more time on the cardio demanding workouts. Trish is fun and funny, take her!", "I have never been able to understand this subject until I took her class. She offers Extra Credit questions on Exams, making it much easier to get a higher score. Very clear and straight forward and is always willing to help if you go to her for it. Overall you could not ask for a better Professor! Highly recommended!", "Paula Moore is clueless to the world. But she did give us a bunch of days off so she would get good feedback from the class.", "No Comments", "she is extremely easy. she cancelled class at least 10 times in one semester because she had other obligations. All quizzes are online. don't even have to buy the book because the labs are online!", "had a bad experience with this class because she decided at the last minute to make it an online class which I didn't like, but when I voiced how I felt about it, she was quick to tell me she would NOT let me fail. She even held optional study meetings and was extremely helpful. Math is not my subject,but she helped alot!! Wld take her again.", "AWFUL! Do not take her as a professor! The most unorganized professor I have had. I've never had any trouble in an english course and I am beyond lost this semester. Neumann has got to do something to fix this problem, after looking at previous comments it has been going on for a long time.", "I felt penalized for my opinions. The assignments required very little work but were graded harshly. The final exam was ambiguous. In the classroom I felt overworked and undervalued.", "She doesn't use class time very well, many canceled classes", "Most boring class ever. If the material wasn't coma enducing enough, her monotonous voice should just about do it.", "Dr. Polin is one of the remaining few professors of education I know who actually give real grades. She expects her students to work and think. She is an amazing mentor to those who show up to learn. She is a nightmare for those who show up to get by.", "I took two online classes with Professor Lape this summer, and I wish I could take more. I greatly enjoyed this class covering women's literature. Participation is in the form of Blackboard posts covering that week's readings. Papers are returned (with great feedback) within a few days of submission. I became better writer because of her.", "She's the worst teacher I have ever had when it comes to math. She doesn't respond to questions and is rude. When you ask a question she will simply ignore it. The videos she posts are full of mistakes . Why do teachers teach anymore if they seem to not care about their students?", "An excellent professor. Very organized, assigns helpful materials and papers. She has high standards and the material is tough, but that's not a bad thing at all. This class will give you a real challenge and teach you some very useful things - just be willing to put in some effort. IR Research was my most stressful class, but also my favorite.", "She was a very helpful teacher and anyone who wants to pass and graduate, obviously has to do the work, so why not take her and enjoy it! Give her a break, she's a math teacher! How easy is it to teach math and still maintain the student's attention? Not easy but she does it well.", "very nice lady too bad she is gone", "The course starts of hard and gets easier as the semester goes on by design. You finish up by watching and analyzing movies. Attendance is not mandatory but she keeps track of it for participation. Read read read and come to class to succeed, bs will not work on exams as she can see right through it. Bring texts to class in order to follow along!", "Good professor. Not very clear with what she wants so you may need to ask a few times to get the answer. Lots of papers, so you better like to write. You need to set aside at least an hour a night to get an A. It's possible, but tough.", "She is an amazing teacher, always keeps your attention. There's quite a bit of work involved but it's worth it. She's fair, laidback and worth having as a teacher.

She is a great speaker, full of energy and very enthusiastic!!", "Professor Lindahl was an awesome professor. She is very passionate about music, and it makes it easy to put in the effort. If she can tell you are trying you will get a good grade. Attendance is highly recommended.", "takes attendance every day, need to be there. Very stubborn on how she wants things written her way, and if you dont write it her way its wrong. nice, funny lady. not an easy class however, takes 3rd grade math and makes it very hard somehow. if you put a lot of time in youll pass, if not its very stressful, dont go out of your war to take this cla", "BVB is the BEST. she's absolutely life-changing, and one of the leading experts in her field. so so brilliant. she's such a wonderful person who truly wants her students to do well & is willing to go above & beyond to help. Tests are hard so you need to put in the work and don't skip class. textbook is usually a CD of images that you will use", "Very knowledgeable of the subject. If you're serious about interpreting, this is the best you'll find. A TON of homework, takes a lot of time.

Yes, everything is about race, but that is just where she focuses her interest. She has her opinions, but is willing to listen to yours as long as they are backed up well.", "Hard class but she's pretty helpful if you ask for help. Class could be boring at times, interesting at others. Very nice prof! and has led a pretty interesting life!", "Sarah is an enthusiastic teacher but is incapable of presenting anything clearly. Many class periods she will forget to go through her PowerPoint presentation that contains important course material. Expect lots of discussion but nothing of any significance.", "Not exactly a gift to the English Department. Those who know her best refer to her as \"Tyra the tyrant.\"", "Greatest teacher ever. So clear. So precise. I wish she could teach every class I'll ever have to take. There is no greatest prof., not only on campus, but in the whole country I am sure. :-)", "Tests are opening book and gives out questions ahead of time, if you prepare, you'll do great. Very understanding of life out of class.", "EXTREAMLY boring.... she DOES NOT make clear what she wants you to do and then when you do it you get a bad grade.", "She is a nice lady but her class requires a lot of work which is graded harshly.

She was no help and gets confused as she writes on the board.", "Anne what world are you in???????????", "Very nice person and good professor! Extremely helpful both inside the classroom and as a counselor, and she made ME 120 very interesting and fun and a great representation of ME. We took a lawn mower completely apart and put it back together as our semester project, explaining how it worked along the way.

She is hilarious and always cracks the students up. Mostly, we only wrote essay and turned in-class work in for homework.

I never did well in math, but got an A in her class because she was so thorough in her explanations", "Beyond brutal: doesnt give you enough time to even finish writing what's on the powerpoint (which are not given). Talks about irrelevant studies constantly. You must keep up with reading the text. Tests are ridiculously difficult.", "I will be honest, I am horrible at math. She teaches half lecture and the rest online. You must get them right or you won't receive credit. Have a question regarding the homework? She only has limited hours so expect to have a question or two only, because that's all you'll have time for. Get ready for a ton of homework. Tough.", "Professor Iten wrote the lab manual for her class, hence why the labs are extremely confusing. The book is full of typos and wrong calculations, unfortunately this class is required for biology majors so there's no way around it.", "I found her class challenging but very informative. you must use college study habits however to pass. tests are multiple choice and come from the book not lectures. she does enjoy women but likes men as well. its humorous. just pay attention and show", "Trish is amazing!

Training and assignments require closely following text directions.", "Instructor is very disorganized, often makes spelling/punctuation mistakes, and is easily confused.

Her grading is also very fair- just practice, you'll be okay. :)", "By supplying our class with heated topics to write about, she made it to where we weren't just writing brainless, dry essays. 1st half of class is going over upcoming assignments, addressing the concerns of the students and going over useful grammar and punctuation tips, Then we shared thoughts about the homework. We wrote 2 short papers a week.", "She's a sweet lady but that's about the only upside. Unfortunately she is also one of the worst lecturers I've ever had. Spends an insane amount of time talking about inconsequential things and flying through more complicated parts.

She loves her students.", "I absolutely love Dr. Woolard; she's a kind soul, and she genuinely cares about her students and wants to help them succeed.

She also offers extra credit opport", "I should have waited till I had taken more psyc classes before because her quizzes are essay format and maybe this would help, but if go to every class, pay attention/take notes, you will do awesome and enjoy it. Of all the classes I've taken (now 8 psyc classes), I use what I've learned here the most in school and at home. Highly recommend!", "HORRIBLE teacher with no plans at all. She takes attendance at the beginning of class and also after break and she gives points for attendance. But that's not the problem, never clear on anything.

Most pointless and confusing class I've ever taken. She's not a bad professor but the subject is just very confusing and abstract. It was a very awkward class.

I would not recommend anyone taking this class.", "She is one of the best professors I think, she really knows what she is doing and you can tell she is definitely interested in her work. Very nice to students and is funny. Keeps you involved, doesn't lecture all class so it moves fast. Very clear as to what's on tests and is helpful.

After one whole semester I did not learn one thing of value. She treats her class like it's going to be your major and runs it like a higher level course.

We spent all class discussing current events instead of the history we're suppose to be studying. You basically have to teach yourself the material.

She's an easy A but having her as a prof isn't worth the easy A; I'd rather take a different prof & struggle for my A. 95-question \"quizzes.\" Sounds more like a final to me. All she does is ramble aimlessly. I don't recommend.", "No Comments", "Before this class, I really hated math. But she helped everything to be so simple and clear. She is very patient, and the way she teaches is in a manner that even the slowest leaner can understand. She will repeat the lesson again and even review before going onto the next lesson. Totally recommended for those who hate math and want a good teacher.", "she's crazy, but it makes the class more exciting. best math teacher i've had since 3rd grade. she does take off a lot of points if things aren't written the way she likes, but she warns you about it beforehand. class went by quickly and lets you out early most of the time. good person", "very good teacher. the best i had. willing to go the extra mile. subjects were well thought out and organized. it seemed like she enjoyed what she did and cared about women's studies and the empowerment of many types of women.", "Makes class fun and interesting.

Also, study guides are exactly like the test, do them and you will at least get a B on the test!", "Overall, Dr. Jackson is a good professor, friendly, and easy to reach. Jackson is very picky and I also believes she grades students based on her history with them. As this was an 8 week course, the work was fairly easy, but increased toward the end.

Trying to write a paper for her is like trying to hit an invisible target. Her directions are vague, yet her expectations when grading are very specific and annoyingly subjective. She is also unnecessarily loud, I've made a habit of wearing earplugs to class.", "Teacher very hard", "I would highly recommend taking Dr. Carnes and getting on her good side! She favorites students but if you participate in class and make an effort you'll do fine. Tests aren't hard. Make sure you study the study guide and you will be fine. Her personality makes class enjoyable and a fun learning environment!", "Tooooooooo bad", "I've never had so much fun learning english as with this wonderful funny smart and HOT teacher.", "Avoid this teacher. Juan Carlos Garcia is 100 times better!!", "Oh No, forget this lady. She made my life hell. Never take any class with her, it's a warning. Her lectures are boring as hell, she only gives her opinion and doesn't give actual facts. Her exams are stupid pointless, I honestly don't know how she became a Professor, Just don't take her especially all the reading she makes you do is a bit crazy.", "Had Nancy for plant physiology around 1986 and still remember her class. What a great teacher. The reviews that say she plays favorites are absolute garbage. Warm, enthusiastic, friendly, supportive. Clear, understandable lectures. Hard exams. Excellent.", "easy professor. very clear and helpful. as long as you understand the materials in class (which is impossible not to)you will do fine on the exams. I didnt need to read the textbook at all. all i did was go over my notes, which was what she wrote on the board.", "Greatest professor I have ever had ,I wish she would teach all my classes. Her shoe of teaching is awesome ,you will learn a lot like I did as a person who's really bad with technology. Take her class and your life will be changed.", "She has a great knowledge of the subject and is a very kind professor. It was an amazingly interesting course. Paper assignments were difficult though and she is a tough grader. But if you enjoy the material, it is definitely worth taking a course from her.", "Dr. Lindahl is great! I am not majoring in anything music-related, but took this class because I heard it was an easier WI. She doesn't even give that many writing assignments, and the ones that she does assign are easy. The homework is really simple and the exams aren't too bad either. Go to class because she does in-class assignments sometimes.", "She is not very friendly. Phyllis seems to be unhappy all the time but I was never sure what the problem was. I would NEVER take another course with this lady.", "She has no interpersonal skills at all.", "Professor Haddad is a very good teacher. She really gives her joy of photography to her students! She doesn't always explain her assignments well but she is VERY helpful when you email her or ask questions.", "PROF. TOWNSEL IS A REALLY, REALLY GREAT PROFFESOR. SHE EXPLAINS VERY CLEARLY AND TRIES HER BEST FOR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND. SHE IS COOL AND SHE ALWAYS ANWERS YOUR QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT AND CORRECTLY. IF SHE MAKES MISTAKES SHE DOES NOT GET MAD, AL CONTRARY, SHE THANKS WHEN SOME CORRECT HER. IT IS REARLY THAT SHE MAKES THOSE MISTAKES.I HIGHLY RECOMM", "Tests are extremely hard because it is total memorization, she is a great professor and very resourceful.", "She was not very helpful. She was a hard marker, but could not explain concepts well. Relied too much on the textbook.", "I have had multiple classes with Yancy. She is so funny easy going and always a pleasure to have. Granted her classes are pretty darn boring even she gets bored but she's good about letting the class go early if no one is staying awake. So sweet and a fun class to be in easy grade take her!", "She's smart, as others have said, but she also let's you know that she thinks she's SOOO smart and SOOO much smarter thn you and evryone else. It becomes annoying and tiresome.", "Boring horrible reading (awful book). Tests are all essay form. Really who the hell wants to write an in-class essay for a history test? Teacher was a good speaker though, kept you interested, the book and tests did not.", "Super smart woman! A definite asset to anyone's education.", "Very good professor. Pretty tough on writing errors, but she helped me when I got behind in the work due to personal issues. Very kind, good and sweet person.", "I had to teach myself a lot of the time. Her tests are really hard because she teaches straight off of the powerpoint. The online sapling homework helps a little with understanding material but I don't think I would recommend her. She doesn't care to help you pass if your failing.", "She took an interesting concept and presented it horribly. I don't know why she didn't include of the Spielberg classics \"Empire of the Sun.\" Maybe she's not that familiar with the subject? She's very rude to the students, she has no people skills whatsoever. Maybe she's openly sadistic. I don't know what her problem is but this class was hell.", "I do not recommend her at all. I would avoid her as much as possible. treats you like a high school student. poor time management skills. she got many problem wrong in from of the class in a row. Does not know material copies straight from book.", "Great teacher", "Her attitude shifts from one class to the next. She acts like she is only there to draw a paycheck. Her teaching is vague and dependent on her emotion. She can be very rude. Even if you try your hardest, she dismisses it. If possible, find a better instructor for Stats and Probability. Even with her credentials, I question her scientific capability", "The prof was missing in action. The entire semester she seldom interacted with students. Maybe teaching is a low priority", "Worthless Teacher...you guys must be **** or sucking on her pen15. She's a worthless human being.", "TERRIBLE, impossible grader, read EVERY clas and tons od research projects and work.", "She is a great archeologist,and she a great teacher. Her class is not hard AT ALL. Very funny and extremely caring. The quizes are every friday to review for the week and she drops the lowest grade. You play jeopardy for extra credit!! She puts underlying theory to practice lol. Take her class!!!", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Professor Larkin is one of the rudest professors at John Jay! Very sarcastic, rude and mean in her comments on work submitted! Avoid her at all costs", "Take her class. You will not regret it.", "Bad teacher. Unclear, seemed to be confused, could not explain worth anything. I learned more from my brother in 30 minutes than I did from her the entire semester. I'd say about half the class dropped.", "This teacher taught me a lot. I asked for help all the time and she always helped me. The class was hard, though I learned and isn't that what teachers are about? Kindness, is one word that discribes Lorrie. I liked her because she was good at what she does 'English writing & grammar' and found it easy to talk to her.", "My roommates said the way she teaches it now is a lot harder than before. Everyone did poorly on the CASE study we had to do. I had a group that did not understand the material completely, which did't help. By the time she explained the material in full for teh section, we had to hand it in. People that went for help still recieved bad grades.", "She is a very nice lady in general and she will help you out but this is the most BORING CLASS ever and its a LOT of reading due in every class.", "Dr. Branch was a difficult teacher to work with. Although she was helpful when it came to projects, the answers were usually vague and not direct. When grading, I felt as if she graded based off of personal opinion rather than the facts that were clearly on the paper. Helps you to become a good writer but not a great one.", "She is very understanding and helpful! I would reccomend her to anyone!", "i love you katharine jones BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!", "Judy is very clear about what she expects. If you do the work, which isn't very hard as long as you pay attention, you will do well. She is very sweet and the classes were decent to sit through. If I were a THAR major, I'd take more classes from her.", "Professor Woody explains concepts in more than one way so everyone can understand. She is enthusiastic about the subject, which makes lectures engaging. The TAs do most of the grading, but she is there at her office hours for extra help or clarification. This was by far my favorite class of the quarter.", "After the first few weeks, there really wasn't any point in having the book.", "Mrs. Cumpton is an excellent teacher, very classy, has a great presence and she is one of the best teachers I had while at ILIS.", "Although Senora Zahajko is a very pleasant and charming lady, she is very hard to learn from as a teacher. She expects you to spend 2-3 hours a day on homework, then doesn't even grade most of it so you don't know if you're getting it right. She zooms through new material and doesn't have time to answer students questions. Do not recommend her.", "No Comments", "She's such a wonderful lady. The textbook she used was very relevant and great for the class. She was very relatable and understanding.", "Very good teacher!! If you study and do your work, she will love you and you will get an A. She is a very lenient grader, and has no problem helping you. Take her!!", "Dr. White is scary and can be rude. She knows what she is talking about but intimidated me to death! Wants people to \"join in the discussion\" and will call you out in front of the class if you made a mistake. I did learn a lot but would have rather had a different professor. If you have to take her you will be fine. I got a B+ for the course.", "Shes an awesome teacher, her work is difficult but she knows what she is talking about. If you listen and do the work,you will learn a lot.", "Excellent professor.", "Dr. Gubacs is a fantastic professor. She is a great athlete and does a good job teaching and relating to the student. Very kind woman and I look forward to taking another course with her in the future.", "She is the best professor I ever had in my life! Great personality and very knowledgeable! Respectful to students and very helpful. Even if you were not perfect but were working hard she will give you great grade! I love her so much!!!!", "1. Her assignments and teaching styles were very unfocused. 2. While the reading was interesting, the discussions following lacked insight and direction. 3. She refused to entertain viewpoints other than her own rigid ones, which greatly inhibited the ability to learn.", "She is definitely a feminist but an all around nice woman.", "funny", "Great professor, she did not say we should not critique the readings, just asked us to do it respectfully.", "She is very good. If you go to class and take notes and listen. You should be able to get a A even if you do not understand old english, she really goes over everything to where you can understand.", "No Comments", "She is the worst teacher I have ever had. She will embarass you, put you down, and make you afraid to ask questions because of the nasty responses you get. She is rude and nasty, and unhelpful. I dreaded going to her class, and so did the rest of the class. Unfortunately, for educ majors having her as a teacher is unavoidable, so be prepared.", "a great teacher, she is hard, but fair, and will push you to do your best", "No Comments", "She's Hard! Dont take her unless your really good in Biology! She is a very nice lady though!", "challenging class excellent lectures", "she is a horrible teacher!!!! never take this class, i done well before her, and she was no help with writing papers!", "She is a best professor. We had 2 project, and 2 exam. I passed her class with a, A or B. I am not sure. However, she is helpful. If you need a good grade and want to take the course, I say take her class. She is helpful, and a great professor. Trust me.", "Prof. Wagman is a very nice lady but sometimes you don't know what to expect. As long as you study the textbook content and attend class regularly, you'll be fine. She won't specify which areas to study but that's fair as everything covered in class is test material. The best part is that she will get you speaking Spanish.", "She is really full of ideas, she's a wonderful kindergarten teacher. The whole time being in the kindergarten is fun! If you ever had any question about teaching...go to her! She's great!", "I can go ahead and say she is a very good teacher BUT for the gender comm class I would not recommend taking her. She is so pro women it makes taking her class as a male akward and disheartend. one would think a class on gender bias wouldnt be so centered on making everyone think the world is out to get women. the text book is awful.", "shes a great teacher, shes very helpful and maker sure you understand the material. I would take another class with her again.", "Shes nice and occasionally has fun in-class assignments but most of the time its just boring common sense material. Tests are essays and study guides are very broad. Not much to evaluate your grade.", "She's an unforgiving grader. doesn't take anything late. it could be 10 seconds late, but it might as well have been 10 days late, she won't take it. She may be good at English, but she really doesn't know how to teach it. doesn't always spend class time wisely. May act like she care about the students, but she really doesn't. 310.", "Very Hot!!!", "the best at campbell", "Great class! Thank You!", "Very good prof, great notes, but tests are not so easy. Very helpful at any time", "very smart and interesting lady.", "She was really hard, but she tried to help as much as she could.", "Dr. Fresolla is a great lecturer, makes you connect the dots, is she tough, yeah but not horrible. Test #3 is CHALLENGE but it is a wake up call and makes you realize that this is Nursing and one CANNOT compartmentalize one's knowledge! However this is the test that will eliminate many, be prepared for it and respect it! She is Nursing boot camp!", "very good teacher", "Great teacher, leads discussions well. Fair grader.", "One of the best classes I have taken at IU and that is because Professor Parameswaran was so fantastic. The nature of the course is interesting so that really helps when there is a lot of reading assigned. Prof. P. makes you work for your grade, but she is very genuine and is one of the best personalities of the IU Journalism faculty.", "Dr. Carr is one of those English teachers that you either love or you hate. You will read a whole awful lot, but the books are generally interesting. Classes are just one big discussion, where basically no topic is off-limits. As long as you can read and just talk a lot during class, you'll get a good grade.", "She was really helpful over email. Most instructors are horrible at that, so props to her for that!", "Nice instructor, will answer texts if you have questions about assignment. Grades based on 4 papers and journal entries. Does not require textbook, but will print out short passages for you to read. Lectures tend to be long, but she seems to care that you do well and provides you with useful feedback. Fair grader and opportunity for extra credit.", "12 DAY INTENSIVE! LOADS OF FUN AND GOOD CLASSMATES INTERACTIVE!", "She's pure evil...gave me an F because i'm not religious or a feminist...easily the hardest marker i've ever encountered in university, don't take her classes!", "She takes off points for simple arithmetic. On our last test she made us memorize ten problems that were all fairly similar. She did so because she thinks we should compete with her calculus class. She rarely teaches from the actual book and instead teaches from her own notes which are not available unless you copy them.", "This was by far one of the most incredible classes I took at BYU. Dr. Siegfried is brilliant and a little bit strange, but she had a way of evoking such great thinking from us during discussions and in papers. Fascinating teacher and very helpful when it came to our capstone paper.", "Such a great topic with an obnoxious, arrogant and hateful lady. Come and see the way she often embarrass people in the class. She is too uptight, and the course materials has nothing to do with the course itself. Looks like what she googled off the web. I regret taking this class!", "Margarita is great, very helpful and friendly, and makes class enjoyable.", "She doesnt really email you about anything, excpet to tell the entire class if your not doing your work then to drop. Her way of grading is really confusing and she is kind of rude.", "I dropped HIST 1301 three times before I took her class. And I got A! Highly recommend to someone who do not like to read too much.", "There are a total of 5 grades. She grades easy because she doesn't care. The tests are 20 true or false. If you want an easy A take this class. If not- you won't learn anything of importance in this class.", "once again the bestprofessor ever. this women is an amazing professor who gets her students involved so much in class that you sometimes dont even realize ur learning something. i would definitly say that you need to take her classes because its well worth it. Definitly ganna be keepin in touch with her because she is such a great help", "Going to the lectures seemed completely pointless, she talks about the same things every day and it's hard to even stay awake. I felt like I wasted money and time being in her class and learned hardly anything.", "I loved the class because Dr. Wood's stories/experiences were soooo interesting!! She made us all laugh all of the time! She is very flexible and understanding if you are having any personal issues and need to extend an assignments due date by a week. She offered to print extra PowerPoints for us if we needed them.Language Module was unclear though", "THIS PROFEESOR IS VERY NICE SHE HELPED ME ALOT TO LOOK AT LIFE IN A DIFFERENT WAY, SOME PEOPLE THINK SHE IS HARSH BUT IS BETTER THAT WAY CAUSE LIFE IS NOT EASY AND IF YOU ARE HUNGRY FOR SUCCESS SHE IS A GREAT HELP TO ACHIEVE ALL YOUR GOALS. SHE MADE ME REALIZE THE BEST THING IN LIFE IS WHEN YOUR WORK FOR WHAT YOU WANT.", "She makes no sense. 30 min. lectures for a simple yes no answer. takes class on a kitten tour on last day of class. Give me a break do that on day one. seems overwhelmed and borders on mental illness. Student beware she is the worst.", "Okay. Im not going to be mean ill be fair. She is scatterbrained but, all sociology profs are. Hense, the discipline must have an effect on the mind. She is a little crazy but a great woman. She shouldnt be condemned for personality. I did not even know what was going on in her class but, if i talked to her one on one she was fine.", "She is a so so teacher. She truly cares about the students. Be prepared to learn the majority of the content on your own. I got an A in this class, she is a very easy grader. The people who said she was a tough grader and gave hard exams, are the ones who did not prepare. This is a tough subject, you need to study.", "This lady just doesn't care, wants to be hard core, spoiling the classroom ambiance.", "Eisberg is awesome. Hardest class I've taken but so incredibly worth it. She is passionate about what she teaches. She is there for assistance if you need it. She wants to help the students. I loved the content. I would totally recommend her!", "Her tests are easy yet she is not an easy marker. I agree that she is picky. she is definitely gonna fail you if you miss her class for more than 10 times.", "No Comments", "Very good teacher. She helped me out a lot.", "very easy teacher. gives you a one week \"grace\" period for all assignments except this one play review. quizzes are matching. take this class to fill your fine arts requirement! rarely use the book.", "good but not that helpful", "There is a lot of reading within this class and it is pretty tough. interesting topics. A great professor, knows the information very well. The class discussion is a good way to learn a variety of ideas.", "Really good teacher, provides many different points of view and life experience examples when possible. Always cheerful! I wish more professors were like her. Tests are pretty easy if you read and do the study guide. I would recommend Dr.Prividera to any one majoring in Communication.", "Greta was a really nice, laid-back, accessible, funny english teacher. I never felt like I was necessarily her student, or that I was in an english class, because she cares about engaging all of her students in their education, treating us as adults. She will be more than help you on essays or whatever, so GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS!! An easy A.", "has basically a mail order mfa from spaulding university. you go there a few times and do correspondence work and they hand you your diploma. her teaching reflects how little she actually knows about poetry, and her lack of a decent publication record reinforces it. one day maybe au will hire a real poet but i doubt it sincerely.", "Learned more from dog****.", "Great teacher.Out going person. you will never be bord in her class.", "Mrs. Pruett is a great teacher but is extremely un forgiving when grading. If you make minor mistakes in grammar, or can't quite write a 1000 word structured essay in an hour in class without any preparation, or have not so good writing style, be prepared to struggle. She is really nice and helpful but her class is EXTREMELY difficult.", "She made me laugh.", "She is a Great professor who really knows what she's doing. Unfortunately, her courses are very difficult and not worth it. Do NOT take this course for a simple GS credit. Unless you like writing atleast 1 paper a week and 20 hrs community service. Take ECON, for the same GS credit VERY EASY.", "She expects a lot from students but you will learn more from her than any other English proff. Very helpful. She loves what she does.", "I'm not sure but I do think that Shelly Fenton's tests are easier. I took this class at the same time that a friend of mine was taking Fenton's and her tests seemed easier. Ms. Johnson is awesome though! I took this hybrid; if you ever have a problem and your work is going to be late, just tell her. Homework due every couple of days :(", "Great Prof! Very approachable & Interesting! :)", "Never ever ever ever take her im in class right now we just got another test and more than half the class failed. She can't teach well but she grades you work even worse she will take all your points for the dumbest reason", "She is very simple. The class is clear to follow. She can be a bit of a picky grader, as she will not really give perfect scores for simple assignments. She does let you re-submit to gain back any lost points and lets you turn in late assignments. Easy to approach. Easy to get a good grade if you just go to class and do all the assignments", "Dr. Baylard is the coolest teacher ever! Really understanding and answers all your questions VERY promptly. She is also very easy going about attendence and class behavior, but you won't sleep here, she's hilarious. Even lets you turn in 1 paper 2 weeks late. Some grade her down on showing up, but she's had unavoidable family & health problems.", "She is an awesome prof. Her notes are so easy to follow(don't miss a class or you will miss a lot of material) and she does a good job of explaining the in-class handouts. Tests are all short answer so make sure you know your stuff because most of the points lost will be because of the lack of explanation. Highly recommend", "Dr. Vanderhoof was such a joy to take. Do not take anyone else but her for this class. She assigns sort of a lot of homework from the book but it's so simple that it's not a big deal. She is the sweetest lady who teaches like you're back in 2nd grade again.", "Adele ROCKS! It's not surprising that most intro students don't like her - she doesn't use powerpoint and makes you think out of the box. She can be scatterbrained, but she knows what she's talking about and she loves what she does. If you put effort in, you will be rewarded.", "LOVED HER! Larkin is an amazing professor. shes very enthusiastic and believes in her students. she will not let you give up, and will push you until you succeed Be prepared to give 110%, she doesnt like slacking, but she will give you a break if you need it. Class is fun, and you make great friends. Highly recommend her! you wont regret it", "No Comments", "I took Dr. Seigfried's class duing my Junior year. I'm a 5th year senior now, getting ready to graduate, and I can say that she has been the most influential professor I have had at BYU. The principles she taught stuck, even if, or especially because I had to work for them.", "Her class was extremely difficult and dense but if you do the readings and engage with it then she's a really great teacher. Her intelligence is intimidating at times but she doesn't do it on purpose, she's just actually that smart.", "Dr. Slusher is everything you want in your nursing professor--tremendous depth of knowledge, clarity in delivering the material, great examples from her personal experience, humor, ability to make. Neither content nor the grading will leave you questioning her teaching. And she brings candy!", "This professor is very knowledgeable and if you pay attention and have a strong previous knowledge of biology and genetics the tests will be easy. Take good notes, pay close attention even if shes boring, you will be fine. Never once did I open the book though I'm sure that is a useful tool. Pay attention,her class schedule is your best friend", "She is an amazing teacher who makes learning ASL very easy to do. She cares a lot about making her students understand. And excellent grades reflect on the way she teaches i would recommend this class to everyone!", "Dr. Vanderhoof is amazing! She understands that most students are taking her class b/c it is a required Gen Ed, so she makes it as simple as possible. She almost NEVER makes you stay for the whole class period. Very kind woman and great professor!!!!", "I don't know what you are talking about. This is the first time she teaches here and, so far, she is going out of her way to help the students. She cares and she is awsome!", "Really awesome and nice professor... she is so organized and prepared and she really cares about her students but watch out for the midterm!", "Ms. Serra is awesome. She wants you to be able to communicate well and to pass her class. Sometimes her lectures lack clarity but she makes up for that with plain silliness. Easy A if you just show up to clase, though she is VERY forgiving if you miss (just give her a good reason why)", "Hard Grader and went to all lectures studyed all notes and materials given and failed the mid term...ended up dropping class", "Horrible teacher! Do not take this class with her.", "She is very helpful! The class was easy,and so were the tests as long as you paid attention and did your homework you would do fine. take her!", "No Comments", "Shaw is an easy professor as long as you go to class. Do NOT buy the textbook, I never opened it. she tells you everything you need to know in class.", "This is a great teacher! Thorough, helpful, very punctual. She always got back to me to help, even on the due dates, which were on Sundays! She made videos about my work personally to help me really understand. Love her, and wish I could take the nest class with her. Do the work and you will get good grades. Book absolutely necessary.", "interesting...", "True, she has a different style of teaching that can be confusing at first.Tests r hard but is a combination of quizzes and lecture (+ she curves!).She's willing to help alot if asked. She expects you to do outside work and doesn't spoon-feed the answers so you actually understand what you're doing.", "I really enjoyed this class! Professor Asplin is super clear when speaking and a lot of the exams come from the power points. It is important to read the book though, because material is used from there too. Overall this class was informative and not hard!", "Marvellous professor. Drily witty, extremly insightful, and a stimulating lecturer. I suspect that anyone who doesn't like her really isn't cut out for literary theory anyway.", "Nice prof! For exams, just study the notes & UNDERSTAND everything (don't memorize). Her tests are more applying what you learned than memorizing, but VERY doable if you study. While studying think of examples of the content and how you can write about things talked about. The semester long group project sucks IF you have a bad group.", "She is so lucid, gentle and playful. One feels as though one were accompanying her on a joyous and novel journey through the ecstatic maze of the Phenomenology.", "Her lectures are extremely boring and a lot of the things on the tests are from the lectures. She uses the entire hour and 15 minutes every class. I recommend attending every class, but after the 3rd week you will start to question why you are attending.", "I won't say that I dislike her. Because I do not. She and I had very different views about the world which just didn't mix. She is a good teacher when it comes to theatre though or at least thats what I hear.", "Mediating Gender and Sex is really boring. She could have made it a lot more fun. Into feminism. Looking back, the class was a lot better than I thought it was at the time.", "Dr. Renick is the best professor. She knows her subject and explains everything very well. Very fair...", "i am not a fan of history so her teaching made it a little harder to like it. she takes 2 weeks to just get through 4 pages and we would have an exam in 1 week and barely covered the chapter. what she reviews does not match the test. when you take her class just read ahead of the class to past the tests. she is a nice lady but not a good teacher.", "She is a very interesting teacher, a little on the nutty side buy very inteligent. She has a habit of geting off subject, but she grades and test fairly. Expect alot of reading and homework time to get an A in her class though.", "She's really nice, and gives really good feedback if you ask questions. She assigns a considerable amount of homework, but it's manageable. But the 3 essays assigned in the course are a little tough so make sure you do them and put effort into it. Overall, good professor.", "[Im continuing my review from the one below] The other comments seem ridiculous. Her looks don't matter, it's about how she can help you. If you are not afraid to ask for help take her. She won't push you away. She does have a little tardy issue but that just means you can be a little late yourself. I wish she was teaching 131 this semester!", "She's a real nice lady,sensitive, helpful, kind, always edges you on, and helps build on your creativity!", "Dr. Dunn is a great person and teacher, but her class is not an easy A. DO YOUR HOMEWORK and DON'T GET BEHND. You must study, study, study (and not at the last minute.) She is willing to help anyone who's willing to help themselves.", "She has a very specific way she wants you to write your essays especially for Lit2010. I would not say she is very clear. Most of the time she confused me because she would condradict everything she said. This made it hard for me to write my essays.", "Okay, I am taking my third class with her. I've got to agree with the majority. At first she was my least favorite teacher and I found her useless..etc..boring..etc...scattered, you get the picture. But I ended up with an A and A+ in the two prior classes i've taken with her and you really do start to understand her teaching methods", "Loud, boisterous, overbearing, intimidating, unorganized, and masculine come to mind when thinking of Kimmelman. Be prepared for a lot of reading and note taking to be up to speed. If you talk to her on a one on one basis shes great and will be accomodating but otherwise in class she is not too helpful and willing to stop or slow down to explain any concepts. Best bet is to have her e-mail address on hand if you are confused about anything.", "She is so funny and makes class a lot of fun, even if it is not something that interests you. She makes class enjoyable and adds in a lot of jokes and fun talks if you participate. her tests and projects are super easy. book is never used because she hates the book. read and take good notes (which she gives you) and youll do great!", "No Comments", "Very good professor. Explains everything well. IF you need help, she will do well at making you understand the concept. Spanish lab sucks, but you have to do it. Overall, pretty amazing.", "Dr Spock is one of my favorite teachers. She is a very hard grader, and getting an A from her on a project is hard, but if you really work hard, you will get an A in the class. She is VERY helpful outside of class. On your research project for CIV, GO SEE HER! She is great, this is just a very hard class.", "She is very nice as a person, and grades papers fairly, but I didn't particularly like her choice of books for us to read. Also just as a note, most of her classes seem discussion-centered, and if she suspects that the class isn't reading, she'll start giving pop quizzes.", "Whe it comes to teaching the students, she is all over the place. If you are a beginner, You have to rely solely on the textbook. Not helpfull whatsoever and she seems like she doesn't come prepare to class. She is very forgetful and if you try to follow, you'll relize that you are being misguided unless you catch it or someone else in class does.", "She is so off the wall and hard to follow. Entire grade is based off of 3 exams, masteringphysics and one final. That's IT. Her exams are all multiple choice and super specific to how she teaches. If you dont write down exactly how to do her problems, good luck.", "This was one of the most interesting classes I ever took. She is very relevant and knows how to relate to students well. If you attend class and turn in everything on time, you should get AT LEAST a B easily.", "First impressions are everything with this professor. If you talk a lot, you'll get a great grade and she'll really like you; if you don't, too bad for you. You can be super smart and write awesome papers but if you don't talk, there's no way you're getting an A.", "Mrs. E is among the best teachers I've ever met. English was for a long time my least favorite subject, and prior to taking Mrs. E I was not looking forward to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrudging through another English class\u00e2\u0080\u009d. However, Mrs. E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s class blew me away. She covers some incredibly fascinating topics and she gives you free reign to explore them. Take her class.", "This was prove that history is useless and should be spent studying on while leisure", "Online class. Too much reading, too many unimportant details in the readings. It is poorly written which makes it difficult to read and understand.", "The teacher was overall nice, but she expects everyone in the class to be going into a journalist field and as such grades quite harshly. If you have a strong opinion of your own writing, chances are it will be gone by the time you're done with this class. Take another English writing class to offset this if this happens.", "Susan was a great professor. She gave many extra credit opportunities, and allowed everyone to pass with at least an A if effort was put in. Showing up to class is not mandatory, but is very helpful in order to receive a high grade. She is very passionate about music, but is also respectful to those that aren't.", "hard as a diamond. i hope atleast someone passes her final exam.", "Wonderful prof who really cares about her students. Notices absences in dedicated students and genuinely wants to help, whether it's school related or not. Love her lots. Made my last year better.", "Easiest college class Ive ever taken. She gives a lot of small easy assignments. A lot of points in this class which helps if you decide to not do one or two. Easy class, and her being very attractive makes it easy pay attention!", "Dr. Sweely works to make art history enjoyable for her students. She give GREAT study guides, so note taking isn't really necessary!", "HOT teacher, pretty easy. I'd rail it!!!!!", "Outstanding prof. The very best.", "Amazing. Simply, simply amazing woman.", "i'd pass.", "This woman is the reason I finish college!!!! Wish they were all like her.", "She does everything but write the paper for you. I actually feel like I learned something in her class and had fun doing it.", "Dr. Renick has a strict attendance policy, but misses classes regularly herself. In addition, she is never in her office during her scheduled office hours.", "Oh my gosh! I just turned in my final and i wouldn't take this class if i were you. Dont get me wrong now, she knows her biology but i think as far as her method of teaching and testing; she sucks. I think the whole class failed (B - and below).", "Kathy was so much fun! I learned so so much on her class. She is helpful, clear, and bubbly! She makes everything so easy to understand. If you're going to take a photo class, take Kathy's classes! Looking forward to taking her Photo 9 class in the spring.", "She is one of the best professors I ever had. She makes the material fun to learn and makes you want to come to class. The workload is reasonable and she understands the work/life/school balance", "English is my 2nd language and I struggle a lot writing essays...therefore not a big fan of it, but her class was great. she is fun, helpful and great thinking. Clear assignments and fair grading... would take her in the future if I oculd", "She is the worst teacher I've ever had. SERIOUSLY. Not sure how she got her teaching degree or if she even has one! Lectures are random and hard to follow. Confusing and unfair grading scale! Just try to PASS her class!", "Very great professor. I had her for two classes and she mentored me for my student teaching. Yes, she does get off topic but she has great stories and so much knowledge regarding special needs students. Her class required writing of reflections for each class.", "she was very sweet and would help you if you needed it, but her tests were very hard almost all sentence translation! so if you arnt good at that then dont take this class!", "She is a very good teacher.She is very helpful,beautiful and nice.She is easy going and she talks everything with her students and it makes every students interesting and enjoy her class.Yo,sexy teacher man.Everyone should take her class.However,she is not a easy marker.", "She is very unorganized, her lectures and power points had nothing to do with her tests, she rarely covered what was going to be on the test.

Some say she is tough but thats not true. Just attend class and dont be an idiot and youll do fine. Best teacher ever!", "Dr. Vanderhoof was a great person and was very fair on grading, almost too easy. Both me and another person received 100% in the class without even putting that much effort into it. I do believe some of my class mates and I could have passed the test to be waived out of a computer class, but it kept my GPA up and was a nice experience.", "I took Camilla twice. I loved her. The first class was women and creativity. There was a lot of reading, group presentations and stuff but if your intrested in Womens Studies its worth it. I bought some of the books and read majority of the information, payed attention in clas and got an A & B.", "I took her Math express one week class, so things were rushed through. But she's an excellent, patient, and thorough educator who clearly enjoys math.", "Fabulous Teacher!!! Very helpful teacher will explain everything makes it clear, teaches illustrator very well shows you a tons of different ways to do things and to learn things. FAB-taculous teacher!", "Overall a great prof. Super smart, knowledgeable on a wide spectrum of issues. Fastidiously organized- has about a 20 page syllabus.

Take her, she's worth the work.", "LOTS OF WORK. prepares you well for 301, but the work is overwhelming.", "She's okay but she assumes that you already know what to do for stuff, when you don't, and acts disappointed when it's wrong. She's really confusing but if you catch her on a good day she's nice. Pray to God that you have a T.A. in her class or you're screwed though", "Going to class was really important for filling in the study guides and notes she provided. If you studied those, the class was pretty easy. It was a little boring, but definitely not bad. She gives extra credit quizzes (can be taken an unlimited amnt of times) that were worth up to 15 extra points for our grade. Good class.", "Excellent choice of subject matter and good lectures. Very, very nice professor. Some were afraid this theory course would be dry but Sparks managed to make it meaty and interesting.", "As long as you do the readings. It's simple. Do the work and you can pass no prob.", "Meh. She was alright. I'd take her again for an easy A. But if you worry about your grades throughout out the semester and want to physically see them on blackboard she's not the teacher for you because she always takes forever to post grades.", "I had Dr. Nodine for Printmaking I, and while she nearly killed me in 3-D Design, she was AWESOME in this class! Have to work hard outside of class in order to finish your projects on time, but it's work you'll actually ENJOY. It's obvious Nodine adores teaching this class. Take this class if at all possible! Funnest art studio class I've ever had!", "Dr. Tenger does a good job guiding class discussion and she finds strange things funny, which makes class interesting. Who knew there was so much in The Secret Sharer.", "Literally the worst professor at Grand Valley. If you like actually learning calc, don't take her.", "Prof. Kaplowitz is one of the greatest LIT professors I've ever had the pleasure of taking. She is extremely clear, she explains everything and she answers all of your questions. There are quizzes every week but they shouldn't be a problem if you read the book.", "She's nice, but a tough grader. You have to do all the work and keep up or you will fail.", "avoid this professor if you want to learn anything. she wastes most lecture time and gives really poor exams, Too many mistakes and vague ans. Lab is a TOTAL joke. This class would not even be worth taking for free, i am only paying for the grade.", "Be warned, Hartos has some very crude raw humor, but I personally laughed like crazy every class she taught. BUT the work is boring a tedious and she has a strict absence policy. Also no curve and half the time she sends her TA's to teach for her. But just give a little effort and an A or B is no problem.", "THE WORST CLASSES EVER. THIS CLASS IS THE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND WRITING COURSE. BEWARE ITS A FLIPPED CLASSROOM SO WHOEVER YOU REGISTER FOR IS NOT YOUR PROFESSOR FOR THE WHOLE 15 WEEKS. BLANCK IS THE HEAD OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT SO FOR SOME REASON SHES THE ONLY ONE GRADING YOU MATERIAL. LOADS OF WORK, CONTRADICTIVE, NIT PICKY.", "worst class. The lecture is word for word from the book, with unclear explanations and no way to answer questions. This class was not supposed to be hard, but it was and more difficult with this instructor. She spent more time talking about investing in stocks and how she started a business when she was 12 years old than she did teaching !", "Extremely hard!! My first D!! A lot of reading and tests are a killer. We were expected to know things that we didn't really go in depth about during class time. Good luck if you take her..", "I was having a hard time with math, but she really heped me understand. She dedicates extra time to those students who are having a hard time.", "Beware! I have never failed a class before until this one. I did all the work but her grading sucks! It's stupid how she corrects hw. She only picks 2 questions out of the entire sheet and if u get the rest right except those 2 she checks, its an F! She should NOT be teaching!", "Gives out lots of homework, but makes the subject matter super interesting. Has flexible office hours and is willing to answer any questions you have. It's nice to see someone so passionate about what they teach. Textbooks aren't too expensive for her May Term class.", "DO NOT TAKE!She is unhelpful and super rude if you ask her a simple question she gives you a condescending answer and makes you feel stupid. She doesn't make things clear and there are way too many quizzes the last few weeks you will have two a day. I really feel like she sets people up for failure", "A hilarious teacher with a sense of passion for what she does. Ask her about the most interesting Roman leader and she will talk your ear off. Papers are tough, but put in the time and you'll get a good grade. Need the textbook for the papers. Overall, an awesome professor.", "Good teacher who gives extra credit 4 or 5 times a semester for simply attending class. You have to do well on the 3 test because they are 75% of your grade. But the test material is fairly easy and simplified. Great teacher in my opinion", "really awesome prof. she's really fun and really engages the entire class with the course material. she makes more of a discussion-type environment than a classroom, and is more of a friendly classmate as opposed to a professor. the class was really interesting, but a lot of reading. she is really clear on what she wants you to do. take her classes", "Dr. Larkin is simply the best PED Prof. in PED at John Jay! I have taken 2 classes with her. She is excellent! Take PED 110 ONLINE with her it is an easy A, forget what the other people say. Se gives good feedback. PE Minor students should take her! Forget these other teachers, (they are too serious) she is the best one to take! Easy A", "The initial meeting of her was deceitful. She's very liberal and vocal about it (in which I'm opposite). I thought I would hate the class but loved it. She's very passionate about what she does and it shows. She will open your mind for sure. It's a great class to take because she truly is brilliant on this topic.", "Professor Felt is a great spanish professor. She makes every class meeting and every second of class fun, and she WILL teach you spanish! Highly recommended.", "This prof is archaic in that content and presentation need work--a lot of work--. Time to retire unless she could update her teaching style big time, really big time, Don't take.", "Oh God! She is aweful and biased. Don't ever take her class unless its the last class on earth and you have no other choice. even then, it would be better without HER class.", "The course was pointless, provided no insight into simulation due to her teaching style, and like all of her classes she taught it like a management class and you learn nothing about the subject because she doesn't know anything about it. This is the only class that directly involves simulation in the BGS major and it added nothing to my knowledge.", "My little sister could pass the course on the material but i think she took off points for spelling my name wrong. Again she tooks off points for correctly answering the question as explained in the book but not as she explained in class... the book must have been wrong?!Since when has \"pie\" been a ****ing variable. makes 3rd grade math confusing!", "Very hard professor to get an A. She'll make work hard to pass her class.... 45 students at the beginning of the semester, downt to 12 sudents.. if you care about your grade dont take her class..", "Wacky lady. A lot of work for a 1000 level class", "I really enjoyed her class. It was a lot of work, yet it was helpful. She is always available for extra help and walks you through all her assignments. I got an A in her class because I worked and payed a lot of attention.", "No Comments", "Unfortunately she is just not qualified to teach about the Middle East. Rather than providing students with knowledge they need to engage and combat the paradigms in question, she attempts to train them as activists. Perhaps this is because her knowledge base is in English Literature, and is seriously lacking in history and politics of the region.", "Interesting class. She's frequently in spats with the Uni President and teaches from her perspective as a lesbian feminist. Excellent for learning about civil liberties in constitutional law.", "She is passionate and yes you will learn alot but the work load is overwhelming and will dominate all of your time.", "Professor Dearing's class is definitely not easy but she is without a doubt a great teacher. You really have to work for a good grade and attendance is mandatory to pass. Overall she was very helpful though, and wants success for her students. I would not recommend this class if you don't like reading. She also was very helpful with writing papers.", "One of the best on campus!", "Took this class during a 5 week session because my advisor said it would be \"easy\". However, there is a test everyday,TWO 10 page papers due on two novels-due a week apart from eachother. Her tests are almost impossible to get an A on because it's all memorization of very presice facts. Wouldn't recommend taking her in reg. semester either!", "Shes nice some of the time other times shes can be really mean and nasty, wont answer questions, degrades you if shes in a bad mood and asks if you know how to read, id advise not to ask her questions during lab but do everything possible to find the answer yourself. not bad of a grader. she knows what she is talking about", "I don't recommend her to anyone. She isn't helpful at all when you have questions. Plus, she is very hard to understand.", "Loved her! She's very passionate about her students and wants you to do good. She knows the material very well. I highly recommend her!", "No Comments", "very patient for those of us who were not good at grammar", "I would tell you to avoid her at all costs, but if your major is art thats impossible. Just keep your contact down because she is a person who will treat you bad and then make you start to believe you can't do something.", "Her organization skills leave a bit to be desired. She presents interesting content, though.", "She is a hard grader but you will most likely get a B not below. So if you are border line and don't really want to stress out with hard reading and writing take her class for that English Honors minor. Nonetheless, if you want to do really well just focus on writing about what she is asking you and do not summarize the movie.. I am serious!!!", "Before I took this course, I was scared to death of math, because it was a subject in which I had always performed poorly. Mrs. Seagle is helpful and kind, and explains the subject matter in a way that is practical and accessible. She expects students to show up and put in the work, but then again, if you do not, you'll never learn statistics.", "The worst teacher I've ever had. She wasn't even challenging, just rude. Completely unfair, not understanding, and judgemental. emphasis on MENTAL. I loved design, and accelled in it, but her class ruined my passion. she needs to retire, desperately. don't take her class. she's old and fake.", "Do not take this class from her if you do not have too. She is not helpful. Her quizzes are very hard. She will tell you to study the lab reports for the quizzes but then there will be things on the quiz that weren't on the lab reports. Always follow her directions because she will take points off for everything.", "She is very unorganized! She also tends to make inappropriate comments about the art discussed. She does assign weekly readings and papers.", "Helped me grow as a student and was really one of the best teacher I've came across at NIU.", "Rebecca Laidlaw is awesome... she wasn't as tough as these comments say she is. she makes everyone feel comfortable with speaking easily in fornt of the class by having everyone get to know one another... the class was acually FUN.", "I LOVE CAROL! she made me laugh. she tells you exactly what she wants from yuo in papers and that's really all she wants! she's very straight forward about grading!", "No Comments", "I like Lisa a lot, she is such a wonderful person!", "No Comments", "A good professor, helpful and smiling but the course are sometimes a little bit boring.", "Tressa is the kindest teacher in the department. She's an easy grader and is very patient with people who struggle. She is also just adorable in general.

Since the class was required, I definitely recommend her as the teacher.", "not an easy a, must do everything to a T to do well. she plays favorites and i was definitely not one. my advice would be to get on her good side and you should do well.", "The worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Boring, self-absorbed, obstinate, thick-headed. Horrible, horrible teacher.", "space cadet, but easy A", "I have had the honor of knowing Dr. Chen. She has been my professor/advisor throughout college. She is one of the nicest most caring professors i've ever had. She truly cares about each student and for their success. She gives great homework feedback and is always willing to help. We all call her our \"mom\" at school. Great professor!!!!", "nice teacher, very professional. Does require lots of reading and class attendance is mandatory. Fair marker.", "this class was such a waste of time. i rarely ever went to it. she rambled on in class about god knows what and her papers were impossible to write cause they never made any sense. she grades terrible and the class is SO boring. i really really don't recommend taking her.", "Judy Gregg was an AMAZING teacher. No need to get the book. All tests are directly from the notes. She is such a sweet, careing woman. Totally approchable and willing to help out her students. Her teaching method is outlines and labs. Very high-schoolish. Easy tests, multiple choice and common sense.", "She's a great professor and her class is interesting. She offers a cheat sheet for every exam only because her tests are pretty difficult. She is a fair grader, however, she takes APA format very serious. If you make any mistakes on an APA format assignment, she will take many points off. Other than that, she's very clear. Offers extra credit.", "Dr. Tenger is the greatest. I just love her classes! She is really well organized and very calm.", "If you knew Spanish before taking intro to Spanish, you'd be fine. If you didn't, then hard luck. Either way it was more useful to tune her out while she taught and teach yourself from the textbook. Substitute her with anyone who knows Spanish grammar, and you wouldn't be any worse off. Just the same, I got a great mark in her class", "She is old and talks very monotone. Not easy on the eyes at all. No peronality and she sucks. She tells u at the start that u are not going to pass. Good Luck!", "Loved Dr. Sweely! She is awesome! Not a hard class, and she gives study guides for test. She keeps the class interesting even if you are not into art and there was not many assignments!

I love her class and would recommend it to anyone, especially if you like to write.", "No Comments", "She is nice and a very social person. Her tests are relatively simple as long as you study and know terms and common sense. She is a teacher you will definitely remember after the class.", "You'll never stop having fun in the class. You'll need to study, but you become friends with EVERYONE in your class so studying is easy. Also, she doesn't give much work since it's a language class and it takes time to learn. You'll laugh so much you'll be crying, that's how amazing this class is. Sensei is the best teacher I've had yet. Period!", "Absolutely the worst professor I've ever had. Never knew what was expected of us in the class because she didn't know what was going on herself. Spent whole semesters begging her to tell us what the assignments were so we'd have a mark for the term. Then, when she did assign something, she'd forget she assigned it. Most disorganized person ever.", "I was really interested in this class, but I love psychology. Dr. Z knows tons and tons about child development, and she always answered my questions. She's strict and likes things to be done a certain way, but I learned tons through this course. It's hard material, and you HAVE TO READ THE BOOK inorder to pass the class.", "Tough grader but very fair. She knows her stuff for sure and will help you out if you seek it.", "Nice lady but kind of stand offish. I found that she doesnt seem to like to answer questions, she says to read the packet. Quizzes are pretty easy. Def. read the lab packet before class because she goes through the explanations pretty fast.", "Very intelligent lady- but you have to write the way she wants you to write. Seems like she's a bit bored with teaching but still an okay professor. Heavy work load, but a fair grader.", "She's really easy and gives tons of extra credit throughout the semester. Her projects are fun and entertaining. She's a little arrogant but who isnt. She has a slightly nasal voice but easy enough to understand. Her slightly difficult but with a little work they can be aced.", "By far the most condescending, mean, disrespectful, and downright rude professor ever. Of all the classes I have taken in my college career, this was the absolute worst. Very unclear instructions not to mention ridiculous amounts of outdated readings required. Do yourself a favor and do not take any classes by her. You will regret it.", "Very nice lady but not a good instructor. She has big assignments due very close together and thinks this is the only class we are taking. There is so much work to do that it's difficult to turn things in on time. Her tests are ridiculously hard, but she puts the hardest questions in the back so I start with the last question and work backwards", "I've previously taken the online course to avoid the in class nonsense. Didn't make a difference with her grading and lack of communication (emails). Never the less, Jenni expects the most out of her students. No excuses are tolerated. You'll read 4 books in 1 semester . If you don't complete the book reviews you will fail. Honesty doesn't matter", "take this teacher! She is really great, she makes a dull subject interesting. Take good notes and the tests will be no problem, I did not even open my text book, she gives reviews of everything on the test. Take this teacher for Soc!", "This class is a definite GPA booster. About half of the time you won't even be in class the entire time. If you have questions, she answers them fully. The course layout was very easy to interpret.", "The WORST teacher I have ever had. It is impossible for this woman to see past her own bombastic ego. Manipulates and mocks students when they have questions. Her License should be revoked, she only holds her possition b/c she wrote the text!", "This professor is one of CSM's finest. She works with her students so they understand the material. She goes out of her way to give students feedback about their work. She KNOWS what she is talking about when teaching class, even without the text. I learned a lot from her. I'm a better writer because of her.", "She was AWSOME! Her class was very hard but it was rewarding at the end of the semester. She did a lot to help my public speaking. I would reccomend her to any person if they want to better themselves in the area of public speaking.", "Karen is very generous and definitely makes learning easy. She is always available for help outside of class too", "An honest (yet sometimes hard hitting) professor who excels at making you put effort into work at the things you need to accomplish for the class. Do not expect to go in for an \"Easy A\", and do not expect there to be special treatment. You do the work, you earn your grade. Whether it's good or bad, that's on you. Read. Don't mess around.", "I took this class over the summer cuz I heard you have to do less speeches and you do, only 3. I was so scared going into it, but it really wasnt that bad. Like I said, 3 speeches and 2 tests right out of the book. She can be pretty harsh but she still gives you a good grade as long as you have the written wrok done how she wants it. Easy class!", "What can I say, loved her and the class!", "By far one of the best class I have taken so far. Required to write a lot of essays but that is the good part about it. You can really see how much you improve from the first essay to the last essay. Definitely recommend!", "very friendly..mother-like", "Dr. Toth is a fantastic prof. She makes what seems to be a boring subject pretty entertaining. She likes to make jokes and will connect with the students if the put in the effort. Quizzes are fairly simple if you take good notes and skim through the book. Be in class, use good grammer and turn everything in on time and you should get an A.", "Horrible teacher, her instructions are super long but aren't clear at all. One of the worst teachers I have ever had. Would rather just have a final test instead of written work during the semester.", "Easiest class therefore she is very strict! U will be handed a contract, listing multiple things u CANNOT do--other work, chewing gum, eating, have the phone on silent/vibrating, excessive absences, etc. This is no idle threat, I've seen her drop people TWICE for these infractions. Other than that u are golden. Less than A, college is not for U!", "No Comments", "I did not like this class at all. The point value given to most assignments is not enough for the amount of work that you have to put in. The instructions are not all listed, but you receive a lower grade because she did not give all of the information. Gives chances to re-do assignments for a better grade, but doesnt give enough points.", "She is one of the best professors on campus. For someone who did NOT want to take a speech class/ interpersonal communication class, she is very understanding of that. The goal is not to embarrass you or call you out but to really help you learn. I would def recommend to anyone. Also, I took her class before and she still remembers me on campus!", "professor espana is a great person. she loves helping her students. if you pay attention in class and do the online homework you will definitely pass the class.", "Professor Spievak is super knowledgeable and Cognitive Psych is SO interesting. This class is definitely not for you if you dont enjoy reading articles, writing essays, or taking lecture notes without a PowerPoint. I personally did really well and liked her a lot as a person. Would take a class with her again!", "I really liked professor Iftode. At first I was on the fence about her, but as time went on, she really grew on me. The class is a little challenging, but if you ask her questions, she will always talk you through your confusion. She's really sweet and a fairly easy grader. Participation definitely makes a difference too.", "Challenging, insightful comments that help you to grow as an actor. Can be a bit wacky at times, but it's not really a bad thing (you're in an acting class, after all). Do NOT complain about warm ups.", "Really nice person, terribly hard language barrier. BORING Class! Easy if you follow study guide. Really nice person but not a teacher I would take again.", "I think the class would have been better if she remembered that it was an Introduction to Costuming. For someone who had never sewed before it was a lot of work even if I tried my hardest. It got to the point where she was moving so fast I would never have been able to catch up, especially since she is pretty unhelpful at times.", "If I wanted to be talk to like a kid id go to a day care. this woman talk to her students like we are 6 years old.", "Dare-Halma for CS 180 is like shooting yourself in the foot if you A: Didn't take a CS class in highschool that went over basic things B: Can't make most of your time for the class. Her grading is very harsh, as your tests have a test review guide in which you MUST know EVERYTHING. If it correlates with anything, its on there. Bad For Beginners.", "If you like kindergarten teachers, you'll like her. She literally will pull you out of class if you've missed a day regardless of the circumstances. Don't take this class if you're far from campus, or in the winter for that matter because if you're late, it's your ass. Show up, and the class is mind numbingly easy. Waste of money.", "the most passionate prof's I've had at York. She loves what she does. Must read the text, really interesting. Fair marker. Museum assignment is time consuming but great. She uses videos for some of her lectures and everything she covers in lecture is posted. Study, read text do reflections and assign, and u'll do well", "easy class if you go to classes. tests not too bad", "She is a good teacher who cares about all of her students.", "She is the worst grader ever. She felt sick for half of the semister(its ok) but she didn't grade my research paper,extracredit paper and finals(given by some other professor)right, which cost my GPA to go way down. Defenitely not good. DONT TAKE HER>DONT KNOW WHAT SHE IS TEACHING.", "Beth was a very good teacher. She used the book a alot and there were 4 major projects the whole semester. She was a bit unorganized sometimes but very friendly and helpful. If you had any questions she would do her best and very leniant at times. Overall if you go to class and do the work you will pass. Good teacher", "Seems like a nice, laid-back professor. Then you get your first paper back and realize that the same writing abilities that have gotten you by with A's since middle school get you a D+ in her class. She's very disorganized and her class is pretty much pointless to go to. Contemp sucks enough without having the the paper nazi as a professor.", "Dr. Tromp is wonderful. she will challenge you, but especially if you are thinking of graduate school or honors project, take classes with her!", "No Comments", "This teacher is very very hard. There are weekly quizzes in there. All of the essays are based from reading materials. No free topic. Very critical on grading essays. No Joke!", "Love Mrs. Austin!! She's the best and she's very easy to talk to about anything!!! I highly recommend her to anyone", "Quizzes are essential, must do the readings, they are not boring, very interesting. No midterm, just a final and one paper. Gives extra credit and is very helpful. Read what you have to read and you should be golden.", "As long as you go to class, it's the easiest class you'll ever take. I didn't do a single assigned reading assignment- i'm sad I wasted my money buying the books. Pretty interesting too in my opinion.", "She's a great instructor and really goes out of her way to help the students out. I took her years ago and could still call her for any help that I may need (in the field of child development of course) We created a portfolio in class which has been with me since and has help me greatly to obtain a job.(emloyers have been impressed) thanks Julie", "yes, she was fired, had her for 1 semester... very rough classes....lectures had nothing to do with the exams.... read the book and u learn more.... i did learn a lot about budgeting and setting up corporate proposals..... this class had pitfalls, but some mountains. shes gone, so oh well....", "Dr. Woody genuinely cares if students are learning or not. This class was so interesting and really broadened my interest not only in philosophy but also in the performing arts, she also gives great essay feedback. I feel lucky to have been able to learn with her and would highly recommend her to anyone who wants a teacher who genuinely cares.", "very clear lectures, you can tell professor enjoys teaching her subject and wants students to do well", "LOTS OF PHYSICS INVOLVED!!! I'm not a mathematical genius so this class and the test's were slightly confusing at times. Overall a good class though, I really received the help I needed when I needed it. I would recommend her .", "Trish is GREAT! I had so much fun in her Step & Sculpt class. We were always doing new stuff so it was never boring. and I lost 10lbs!!!!! I took it last quarter. I loved it so much that I'm taking it again this quarter.", "Wonderful! She talks fast, but you can always ask her questions. Very easy to talk to. She is cute and a sweet heart. You won't forget her. Take her if you are interested in art.", "She is consistently 10-15 minutes late for class. If you miss a class for any reason, including death in the family, even if you let her know ahead of time that you will be absent, you will get a zero for the work you missed. She does not allow any make ups and has really screwed some of her students over.", "No Comments", "Cindy, she is okay I guess, she expects a lot of work for a bs computer class. You have at least 4 to 5 assignments due each week and then when you do them and you follow the directions as best as you can she takes off points without explaining why so you can better yourself. I mean do the assignments and you'll be fine.", "She never checks her email and uses outdated information. She also needs to grade on more than just attendance, I would suggest taking this class because its an interesting topic but NOT with her.", "I am a great student and and the most difficult time with her class. She rambled on and on about nothing relevant. HER TESTS ARE RIDICULOUSLY HARD! The class consists of 2 tests, a paper and attendance. If you did poorly on 1 assignment there was no hope for raising your grade. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!!!!!", "I find Dr. Greene's ability to connect with her students refreshing. Engaging lectures, and constant feedback with her audience. She is obviously passionate about education. The drawback is that note taking on lectures is difficult. The material is based on the ongoing changes in the legal and social society, textbooks are fairly irrelevant.", "She does favor those who are vocal in class and demonstrate comprehension of the material, so sit near the front and speak out. I got a B+ in the class and cracked the book maybe twice. Just look out for the squeeks.", "This class was a tough one but if you were dedicated and did the work it wasn't too bad. She gave detailed explanations on what you did wrong and how you could improve on projects. She was also very helpful when I came and saw her. She understood my problems with group members and worked with me to fix them. Beware-she will talk your head off!", "Extremely nice lady. Five exams and one paper. Good class but way too much material. She needs to lessen the amount but get more in depth. Lectures are interesting but don't really fit tests. Tests seem more like a memory exercise. She takes attendance so don't miss more than three classes. I got an A.", "bottom line charisse is a great women. her classes are fun but intense. YOU WILL LEARN ALOT!!", "I had prof. Blanck for American Studies. I was super intimidated when i first started the class. We had to buy a number of smaller books rather than one big text. The class to my surprise was pretty awesome and she is super helpful! if you ever need anything or have any questions she is totally understanding and helpful! great class and prof!!!", "Throughout the class I was able to learn about different photography techniques I had no idea about. Important to mention, Haddad is a very hilarious instructor and easy to connect with.", "LOTS of reading, but if you pay attention the class isn't too bad. When I took it she let anyone who had above an 88% not take the final, so my entire grade was from two 3 point quizes, a 100 point midterm, and a 100 point essay.", "Easiest class I've ever taken. Easy A! She's a good professor too.", "No guidance whatsoever. Not organized. Not sure what she wants. She is very confusing.", "Aurora is the best professor NYU has to offer.", "Really nice and understanding professor!!! Go see her if you ever need any help.", "if you read your texed book you'll get an A", "not fair at all!!! i would never take her class again", "One of the best professors I've had. She not only wants you to pass but actually do well. She allows you extra credit if she sees you put in effort. Her lectures are very interesting, she is extremely knowledgable/passionate. It is so different from your other classes just by content- very refreshing. You will need the CD, which is a bit expensive.", "Her lectures were always well organized and informed. She was an awesome prof to have. You can tell she knows what she is talking about.", "I'm taking her business simulation class, and the homework was a full-load of pile. We had 7 in the group and now only 2 left, and both of us have to do all homework designed for 6 people and she wouldn't lack us off. Taking her class is challenging.", "She is not a teacher...she is a propaganda pusher...and a manipulator. Liberals and psycho-chicks/feminists will love her...non-liberals and non-psycho-chicks/feminists should drop her class ASAP...for good reason...because she is not a teacher...and your tution money is being wasted. She should be forcibly removed from the school (this is a Jesuit institution, not College Park).", "DO NOT TAKE HER. I took her because of the easy reviews however Spring 2012 she took off suddenly to medical leave. She misses class a lot so the school took action. We got this new guy for a teacher who made the class quite difficult. Quizzes were more challenging as were the lengths of the essays. A lot of the class did poorly on quizzes.", "Took her for Crime, Media, Violence. Very charismatic and interesting. Funny dorky jokes propel the otherwise dull lectures. Very hard grader, doesn't really tell you what you did wrong/what to write on. Not the best, not the worst.", "Professor Eisberg is a great professor. She's super enthusiastic about astronomy and very helpful. There is homework pretty much every week, you should be prepared to dedicate a few hours to that (basically twice the length of the online lecture). Lots of assignments, but they're easy and are all completed in class.", "She's like the happy helpful mom-ish teacher in a film. Does everything she can to help each student individually, both with class projects and related outside projects. Wants you to succeed!", "Just never mention the 2nd wave, she gets mad if you critisize it and takes it very personally. Also, it's impossible to get an A+ in her class - which is BS. If you desserve the grade - then you should get it. She rants sometimes, and she sometimes does not take critiques. . . .", "Super helpful. I have never worked on a lawnmower before but she was very understanding in the lawnmower lab and was quick to answer any questions we had. Go to class. It's not hard and it's an easy A if you just show up. Lectures were usually really short", "Took this course expecting it to be about Women and Religion in Ancient World,as the title suggests, and yet somehow have found myself in an archeology course. Unless you're into that sort of thing, I'd rather be watching paint dry. It's a disgustingly easy course,but she's a flake.This was for a gender studies minor,& I learned about ancient pots.", "Professor Julia Allen is a wonderful and also a knowledgeable person. She makes the class fun! We had debates on everything. If you are smart you will take her!!!! Last but not least...she grades on the curve!", "Yes she is a tough teacher and she does intimidate you. But if you really want to learn spanish and literature this is the class to take. Its a lot of reading. She is very knowledgeable. You might hate it but i think the pain was worth it. You will only get how much as you put into the class.", "No Comments", "It is not for your own good. I was not happy with her.", "One of the most helpful and knowledgeable professors I have ever had in college. Very clear and extremely helpful. You can tell she's not there for just a paycheck, but sincerely cares about helping students understand the material. Super busy on campus, but will make time for you. Attendance is mandatory.", "I really like her. Shes very helpful and wants you to do well. She will also go out of her way to make a test review so you're prepared for the tests and exams. I WOULD take her again.", "VALUE ADDED. Western is lucky to have her. Dr. Sinning is easily one of the best professors I have ever had, hand down. She makes the subject CRYSTAL clear, and is EXTREMELY helpful if you have any problems (almost clairvoyant). And talk about professional! Even if you aren't studying accounting, you should take her tax class. Thank you Dr Sinning!", "Mima is a classic lecturer, she truly is passionate about her field. She is rather dull though and does not get to know her students in tutorial, we had to use name cards the entire semester of a tutorial of 10. Essay is extremely straightforward, however the Final Exam should have been a take home memorize passages and DETAILED content.", "My suggestion? Take history with someone else. Enough said.", "No Comments", "SWEEET LADY that loves her In-N-Out! I'm not into philosophy.....and this class made me not want to take interest in philosophy even more. Class was boring and i didn't attend 80% of the time, except on test days. Passed with an A because i actually did a bit of reading for the tests and i took the assignments seriously!", "I never had her but my roomate did and she cried all the tome caus eshe studied soooooooo hardthen the tests would be on nothing they covered in class(she had her twice). Avoid this teacher she seems a little crazy", "One of the best professors you will every have. Organized and fun, will listen and help you understand. I recommend you take her for any class she teaches. You will learn.", "She wasn't a bad teacher, but not someone I would recommend to anyone else. She makes you read a lot of books which isn't great but as long as you aren't an English major you'll be fine. We were supposed to have five papers and we only did three, and she cancelled class like four times", "She isn't a fair grader. She's offends her students. Honestly, there are way better professors to take rather than her. Maybe outside of class sea better, but probably not. She divorced and angry it seems like.", "Wonderful professor, was struggling in the beginning. She took her time, made sure I understood what she was talking about. If you can take her whenever possible.", "Most attentive get right back to you right away clear honest and smart teacher online I have ever had! grades weekly. Sense of humor and cares about how you do. You do have to read the work and do research.", "Most consistent, organized, helpful and clear teacher I've had this semester. Would definitely recommend.", "Very good teacher, good sense of humor. Very smart.", "Wonderful techer! She makes learning fun. I wish she taught all of the education classes at Cal. She truly loves teaching and will remind you every day why you are in school for education. Wonderful wonderful lady!!", "A really great professor, she knows her stuff. You need to pay attention in class and seek help outside of class or you will fail the exams. Midterm and finals were both hands on. Final project used concepts from the entire semester. The textbook is only used for studying so if you can borrow someones do that. Attendance is mandatory.", "She is very helpful, makes history fun..really i don't like history but she was awesome", "overrated, pretty full of herself.", "The worst teacher I've even took a class with in my enitre life.", "she has a bad personality", "Upon meeting Dr. Iten she can seem rather intimidating but you need to go introduce yourself. I struggled at the beginning but then realized that If I just start preparing at least a week in advance, it is so possible to do well. Dr. Iten and the lab manual both put on a scary front but she makes a way bigger deal of it than it really is.", "Absolutely brilliant professor. She could probably write a music theory textbook herself if she wasn't busy teaching every class and doing research. She's sometimes too brilliant to understand, but she's always more than willing to help you, and she'll look over your projects as well. Also, she's really, really adorable. Fun class!", "MEAN. NASTY ATTITUDE.", "Highly recommended. If you take good notes, and review them before the exam you'll do well. Attendance is mandatory.", "Very understanding professor. I missed her greatly during winter term. I hope she and her family are doing well. She helps students greatly, and she is very approachable during office hours.", "A very helpful and informative professor.", "Let me preface saying I got a 98% in the class. BUT... it was the hardest I have worked in any class in a long time, especially online. To get a good grade, SUMMARIZE THE BOOK! If you are willing to put in the time, you can do well, but taking it in conjunction with other classes is an ill advised move.", "She is very rude. If she feels comfortable with you she has no problem calling you out in front of the entire class, making you look stupid. Unless you are one of her favorites, she could care less about you, or how she makes you feel. You do get a good work out, but it's not worth the humiliation or the frustration.", "This class is definite;y an easy A. With that being said you do have to come to class. You don't get points for being in class but that is the only way to get notes. There are only 3 test including the final, I paper that is worth just as much as the test and a family shield. She gives review sheets there is no way possible not to pass this class.", "very easy class, hardly no homework or papers.", "LOVE HER! you actually get a nice workout... its great :) love you gel!!", "Worst teacher ever.", "Pretty chill teacher. No late policy so just turn in assignments by last day of semester and you are set. As for attendance - leeeel whats that. only went 5 times Difficulty of class: easy. For 2 creative projects2 agora days - just turn in and free 100% For 3 short essays - actually put some effort into it and you're good.", "About to graduate and Ewa's classes remain the most memorable. If you are passionate and interested in the topic she is teaching, you will learn more than you intended to. The one thing that helped me earn an A in every class of hers was CONTACTING HER. She wants to help her students! I had phone meetings with her before every paper. Ewa is amazing", "No Comments", "Dr. Zlokovich (I refuse to call her Dr. Z) is unhelpful, disinterested in the lives of her students, and on the verge of spiteful. Her tests have questions not covered in lectures. The answers are buried somewhere in the 200 pages of text each test covers. Don't take her class. If you're already stuck with her, just go to class and read the book.", "Excellent Prof. Keeps things energetic and fun. Is very interested in peoples theories and opinions. Very fun class, I love it!", "Margarita is so sweet and makes spanish so much easier then other teachers.", "She's a nice person, gives her time to students who utilizes office hours. Hard coursework and a lot of homework, but doing it really helps with the exam. Pick if you can allot enough time for it", "She is an amazing lecturer and I love going to class. She keeps the class very interesting and the lectures are very informative and fun. She keeps the students engaged all the time. Overall if you are going to take a class in which she is teaching will not want to drop the class it's going to be super awesome and you will learn. She's amazing.", "Had her for an online course. I've never had a professor who was less helpful. I emailed several times for clarification on specific types of problems, and she told me \"Spend more time studying.\" When I was already spending more time on this class than my other 4 combined. Would not recommend her for an online class!", "had her for 320...sweet lady loves what she does...boring lectures, tedious work assigned, essay tests (must read text in order to do well in this class) goes on tangents most of the time...attendance is mandatory...dont recommend this class", "this prof. is not helpful at all.she tells you to go back over your and read it again.if you do not have a one word ans. on your test you can not give her a sentence,she will not accept it even if it's right", "Dr. H is an amazing teacher! She's funny, insightful, and she knows her material. Expect to work hard and study often. She likes students to be involved in class discussions. She doesn't play around with work; she assigns, you complete.", "Dr. Toth is super awesome. She makes you work fairly hard but her classes are fun and she is very genuine as a person", "AMAZING prof. Definitely my favorite prof at Brock. I love her so much. I learn so much from her, and she is so helpful and actually cares about her students.", "I highly recommend taking your ENG 101 with her. She's extremely nice and understanding. The class isn't hard at all as long as you follow her instructions. She's always there to help if you are confused. Only downsides are that she does not post grades on D2L and rarely checks her e-mail.", "Prepare to re-enter 5th grade! Attendence is taken EXACTLY at start of class if ur late at all points off takes attendence again after break if u leave points off heaven forbid u speak at all during her lecturing all these points are taken out of your grade I attended and got an A so i am not 1 of those irrate students just mad over a bad grade.", "Likes absolute control.", "Really nice lady she is very enthusiastic about what she does. Her class is very hard but I learned alot and she is a great teacher. you just have to work hard if you want a good grade :)", "This class includes a lot of writing.", "She was one of my best Professors - her classes were memories I will keep for life. Thank you!", "lovessss it", "This prof talks to you like you are a child of 7, not an adult of 19 -20. It's a joke. Haven't been in something so juvenile since 2nd grade. Insulting. Didn't learn a thing from her. Good thing students do her job for her. She doesn't seem to respect students enough to talk to them as adults. I don't pay thousands to be treated like I'm 7. Avoid.", "Just the worst.", "No Comments", "Yasmin rocks! Helpful, intelligent, understanding, and truly cares about your performance and you as a person.", "DR. Keehn is one of the best UTSA has to offer! She is passionate about educating children and creative in her methods. You will learn more than you can imagine.

She makes the class interesting.", "I took this calss with her and it was terrible. I didnt know what she was even talking about because I was too busy taking her useless notes. I admit I failed. I toke it again with another prof and now I have a 89 average!!", "Prof. Giamptro is very sweet and personable- as far as the class she really likes to cover all perspectives and is not bias at all... she is very student-centered and she teaches in hope that you succede. The course load is relatively easy, she looks for insight and use of text in papers- no tests.. also a very helpful advisor", "Quite interesting thought process. Exam are often tricky.", "Dr. Jackson-Jones is a very well structured teacher. she tells you what she wants and pushes you to do your best. She TRUELY cares about her students. she will go above and beyond for you. I wish I had her for 101 and beyond.", "she treats all of her students like 12 y/o's.", "Sue Sipple is is witty, humorous, and easy to talk to. She is understanding if you have a good reason to turn in an assignment late. She makes everything clear. I would recommend her to anyone interested in actually learning something new.", "Felt is a wonderful teacher and woman. If I could have her as my professor for all subjects I would definately do it. She gives just the right amount of work and always teaches the subject matter before assigning anything. She's terrific. I highly recommend her!", "Maps were a pain and graded subjectively. The essay exams and group presentations were no different. Professor is not very yielding in any manner.", "I'm currently in this class and it sucks. Its friggin health class so it should be easy, and I shouldn't have to try gah dammit!anyway... I studied for the last test and didn't do so well, even with a study guide. It'd be more helpful to know exactly what's on the test. Wellness project is easy tho.", "One of the best prof at Seneca. Shes so nice and easy marker", "Best professor by far. She is one of the few that truly cares about the well-being of her students. As a result, she devotes considerable time and effort into improving her students and preparing them for life after graduation. She is also extremely approachable. I am a better person because of her.", "Prof was only present at the beginning of class and did virtually nothing to help us understand the material. The textbook (which can only be bought from her and has no resale value) literally contradicted itself and made understanding simple things impossible. In addition, it was ripe with simple spelling mistakes. Overall, it was a bad class.", "Dr. Iten isn't the best professor around. You only see her at the beginning of class when she wastes the lab time you have answering questions with clickers. The lab manuel is kind of hard to understand and there are many spelling and grammatical errors in it.", "No Comments", "Dr. Chirico is an awesome teacher. She likes when you have an opinion and even disagree with her opinions sometimes. As long as you talk and have an opinion in class she will love you.

I am so much more knowledgeable having worked with her.", "No Comments", "she's really nica and will always work with you if you need help", "Mrs.****an allows students to work together on projects most class periods - she takes this information and arranges tests.

Piaget's, Kohlberg'", "I had Sipple for English 101 and 103...I took her again for 103 because I really liked her. She was really helpful and let you go back and fix papers before turning in your final one. I highly recommend her. Especially if you are a strong writer.", "For beginners, and everyone, Dr. Chambers is very helpful. Tests are easy as long as you pay attention in class and look over the info. She's really nice and makes class very interesting.", "The way she structures her class is meaningful and makes sense with the subject. You are expected to take the time to read all the materials she provides and take notes on everything. For psych majors this class is important! She is kind and funny and participating in class is easy to do and can be fun. She expects you to do the work .", "She is intelligent and kind. However, the constant powerpoints of the readings got dull. When she didn't rely on them to lecture it was great. She will show you a lot of perspectives and the class is overall incredibly interesting.", "Not helpful. Not consistent with what she said would be covered on midterm/exam. Telling stories not teaching. It is supposed to an awesome course with real life information needed and practice - The prof is away from it.", "Simply one of the greatest. Drops all her work to attend to her students. Awesome.", "If you are a fast thinker in math she is the best, if not DO NOT TAKE HER! She is a sweet old lady, but man, she whizzes through everything so quickly inside of class, and outside of it. She goes way too fast, and I was always lost. If you can't think fast in math, don't take her class.", "good teacher. but teaches the class very hard", "Dr. Clark is the best professor I have ever had.

If you give your all, you will succeed--if not, you will not be respected by her. Weird sense of humor, took me awhile to \"get\" her. I bet she's fun when she lets her hair down!", "Wonderful professor. She is very energetic and driven. No homework other than reading. Takes attendance randomly. Gives study guides for her tests. The only downside is the amount of reading required. There are three books that must be read, and read carefully, for this class. I suggest you make a friend in the class and study for the book exams.", "Speech assigments are pretty basic, however, I do not like being graded in front of 20 other students. I would prefer a basic Thank you, and sit down. She goes on and on about all of the negative things about the speech. She was more interested in theatre then speech. Don't take this class unless you have thick skin!", "She great! I love her. She tough yet hepfull!!!!", "Good god, I've never met such a self-absorbed professor. Yes, she has ideas - but she's not a teacher. She is unapproachable, and I wonder what exactly she says to herself each Tuesday evening when coming to class because it's obvious she does not want to be around us or TEACH us for that matter. She repeats too much - as if we're ignorant children", "Sue was a fun prof to have although the class was a bit vague and it was sometimes hard to tell what she wanted. She was willing to help, but sometimes stuff still didn't make sense. Overall not a hard class for me, but it was for some people.", "Sarah is one of the best professors at Clark. She is enthusiastic about teaching, incredibly intelligent, and very warm-hearted and helpful. She is very inspiring and I would reccomend any one of her classes!", "She is by far the best teacher I've had at Harding.

I learned tons from her. She is always willing to help. She is my favorite professor:)", "She doesn't explain things very well. Laughs when someone has a wrong answer or doesn't do their homework. Exams are nothing like we've done in class or for homework. Difficult to study for. Better off using online videos to teach yourself. Only goes over easy examples in class and gives hard questions on the exams.", "nice teacher if she likes you", "No Comments", "INSANELY HARD PROFESSOR! I tried to meet with her about certain aspects of my grade, and she seemed extremely hard to get in contact with, as well as unresponsive to emails and inquiries. I would NOT recommend her if you care about your grades at all.", "She's very fun, but talks too fast. She's more organized this term. The Econ is the course is okay. Marks things really fast, returns you the essays the next class! A fair marker.", "Excellent teacher. Provides all the necessary resources to succeed. As for me, I hate economics. I basically just memorized the material and regurgitated it back out for exams. Not the teacher's fault, though. She tries very hard to make the subject digestible. I just have a hard time with ECON stuff.", "Dr. Miller is the best. She makes Chem so understandable for non-chem majors. Her office door is always open if you need help but for the most part, her lectures are easy to follow and the homework really helps prep for tests. Also, effort does not go unnoticed in her class, even if it is a large class! Take her if you can!", "she tries really hard to teach us the topics, but still is not really clear. the course is pretty easy in the beginning, but definitely gets a lot harder toward the end, and the final is a killer. labs are also a waste of time", "She is hard but not that hard don't get scared she may give a lot of homework but it is easy to talk to her .

She is also a very nice person.", "Dr. Lorden is sweet and she honestly just aims at giving you the absolute best learning experience she can. With that said, get ready to work because yes, you learn A LOT. Thankfully, her lectures are pretty helpful and she made the math eay to get. She often calls on you in class. She is a good teacher. Tough course. Can be slow to reply to emails", "She was probably the worst Psych teacher I ever had. I had signed up for someone else but she wound up teaching instead. I almost failed that class, and my last 2 years of school I only made like 1 C in all my classes..She SUCKS!", "Take her class for an easy A. She gives lots of stories to keep you interested. Easy graders and doesn't rarely assigns homework. When she does, she gives you full credit just for turning it in. Very friendly as well.", "Good prof! Explains things well. Also does a lot of inclass work to make sure you are ready for the exams. Two very long papers (all stats have them), but she is very helpful and proof reads them - DO IT! It makes a huge difference. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot! ** Lot of work - make sure other classes are easier to allow time for it", "Dr. Keehn goes above and beyond all other professors I've ever had, and will proabably ever have! She is wonderful, cares about all of her students, and strives to turn out the best teachers. If all of the professors in the college of education were like her, we would be so prepared for lies ahead in teaching.", "Echoing another review, Ms. Edelson takes her students' work seriously. She spends a lot of time editing essays and helping her students develop their ideas. She has an unimposing brilliance that inspired me to produce some of the best essays I have ever written. I would recommend taking this class solely for the collage essay.", "This class was not easy. It is definitely the weed-out course for biology freshman. The main key to doing well was starting off strong. Don't wait til week 3 to start reading your manual and the blog or looking at the sample in-lab quiz questions because it will hurt you. You can do well if you're willing to work for it though!", "Honestly one of my favorite professors. I am through with my undergrad but her lectures are the ones I remember with great fondness.", "She is a very nice teacher but you defiantly cannot slack in her class. Quizzes were given every week so reading was a must and so was attendance.", "Best professor ever! Funny, fun, great discusssions, explians material well, and very helpful. This class is challenging, but no one learns anything from easy classes. Not that much reading. Analyze movies at end of semester. I looked forward to class. Knows all her students. Her enthusiasm made me more excited to be a English minor.", "Condescending,rude,and arrogant!0 Tact! Test questions are ambiguous as are paper critiques. She attacks students privately submitted work through discussion posts. If you paraphrase and reword research and give credit to your sight source she will still give you an \"E\" for plagiarism.

She is now teaching at columbus state though.", "Makes you think but the essays were awesome to read. Very helpful; you need to attend class but will do well if you put in the effort", "She is one of the greatest professors i've had so far. She has a way of connecting real life with the things we have to learn in class to make everything interesting. You HAVE to do the reading, otherwise you'll fail the tests. Read and come to class and you'll do fine.", "not a good advisor told me to take classes i know dont like", "I was left sitting in lectures looking around and wondering if I was on a different planet.....a pointless waste of time. Tests were completely different than homework, quizzes, and pass exams. I feel I did not lean anything and it therefore set me up for failure in math for the rest of my life.", "She simply goes over the problems in the book. She doesn't even lecture!!!", "Cathy is the best instructor for Psychology! She wants people to understand the \"concept\" of things, and not just \"memorize\". However, the quizzes can be a little tricky if you do not pay attention. She gives fun assignments in and out", "Great class, great professor! Gel and the class itself is difficult but if you tough it out you will not only plass but develop useful skills as a dancer.", "I could tell she loves her subject but she is a bit scattered and that makes it hard to learn from her. I enjoyed being in this class because of the classroom discussion but her lack of preparation is hard to learn anything from her. So if you take her GET THE BOOK!!!! READ THE BOOK!!!!! Do those 2 things and you will be fine.", "I think shes very good, its just the class which causes problems. It helps when people print out the notes so they arent asking stupid questions. The honors section is really fun because we can talk about different topics from any time period in Russia that we pick.", "A bit boring, but the exams are very representative of what we see in class...", "Cynthia really makes sure you know she is there to help you at anytime. She even came to our study group on a Sunday in her personal time. She expects you to work at learning, not just show up. Anyone saying she's a bad professor wasn't willing to put the work in. Tests are a little tricky, be careful.", "I love her! She's so cool. Took her 1 & 2. Makes history very interesting! All round...(100x)Easy! If your not good in History...take her! You will love it! Save money because you don't need a book! Print notes off BB and go to class and fill in the blanks. Tests & Quizzes are straight off the notes! I'm going to Miss you MS.HILBURN!!!", "She's a tolerable enough woman but as a big fan of art, she bored even me to tears. You have to show up but if you bring a laptop, you can entertain yourself on Facebook the entire time. She'll let you use notecards and make sure you do the chapter quizzes and you'll be fine. BRING SOMETHING TO DO -- It's unspeakably boring.", "Cynthia is a very good professor. She is very passionate in her work and knows her stuff. If you don't put in the work and don't study you will not do well in this class. She is the one of the best instructors at KVCC.", "one of the most intellectually stimulating professors i've had. she will really make you think about things you've never thought about before. difficult and challenging, but you learn a lot of you're willing to put in the work.", "Very Liberal, so she talks about her politics all the time. Your wrong shes right. Alot of class discussion.", "She is very willing to help you if you haven't done well on your tests if she sees you doing what your supposed to. She is Libral and since she is a very important person on campus, has a lot of info to share. If your a Dem you will like her.If Your a repub, wellDiscussion will rise. Its a fun class", "This professor is HORRIBLE. I spoke minimal spanish prior to this class.This professor has ruined the language for me. She doesn't explain things well and she expects you to be fluent.. she gets MAD when you don't understand something!!! She's friendly, but not a good teacher for an intro class. Expects you to be fluent by the first week!", "If this is the only class you have she is great! But most likely that is not the case. I had more homework in this class than all of my other classes combined! She thinks she is the best person in the world, always brags about her being on CNN. She also talks about airlines like there the best thing in the world and bashes the healthcare feild.", "She is a tough teacher but she will make sure you learn how to write a paper on a college level and make sure you come to class on time everyday cause she will point and snap you out her class. very funny.", "I hated this class! Nice lady, normal college professor. I'm not great at math and I usually get a B, in her class, I struggled with a C. Quizzes every week stressed me out.", "I had Prof. Amdur for Exec Comm & Leadership- In 5 years @ FDU I have never met a better teacher! It was a great way to end my time @ FDU. BEST PROFESSOR. Really getes to know the students & is always willing to help & listen!", "Tina is a great professor. She helped me grow into the leader I have become today. We grew very close over the time that I attended her classes and I would recommend her to anyone. She is a great educator, mentor, and friend.", "Professor Praitis is helpful. BUT, she really takes off a lot of marks on attendance. She CURVES, not in a good way. If she wants only three A in class, she gives your final paper and poster Bs without telling you ANY REASON so that your overall grade can fall from A to A- or B+. On her class, BE CAREFUL on your every homework and quizzes.", "Great teacher but I felt this class was designed more for full-time students. 3 hour lectures twice a week, fairly grueling online homework, and online quizzes and tests almost every Friday and Saturday! I would not recommend if you work, especially full-time. Loved the online platform MOM, but could not handle the overall time commitment.", "patient and concise", "She's an extremely sweet women, but does not know how to direct students on learning to draw better without confusing them. Several times when an assignment was given, people would do it wrong and have to redo it for the next class.", "Power hungry", "As all the others say she was lazy and didn't know very much (including the OSI model!) As of Summer 05 she has been \"laid-off\" with a bunch of other staff. Devry is going down hill fast...", "Tenger is my favorite. She is very accessible outside of class and genuinely wants you to succeed not just in her class, but in life. She is a pretty easy grader if you do what she wants (she gives tons of handouts with exactly what she wants you to improve on). She's actually a really nice person, though she may seem intimidating at first.", "Ewa is tough. You will learn more than you ever thought you would. Three exams and two papers due. She assigns a TON of reading. I am taking five classes and half of my study time is just for her class alone. She'll make you work for the grade, as all good professors should. Really interesting stuff - just make sure you have the time!", "The lectures are enjoyable, the projects and papers are easy, and the exams are reasonable. Honestly, the only bad thing I can think of saying is that she made us buy an expensive book that I've barely used. She seems to really care about her classes.", "Great professor! Con Law is fairly muddled as it is, but she does a good job clarifying. Very helpful during office hours. Doesn't really call on students, but likes students who participate so volunteer! Con Law II was even better than Con Law I so stick with her. Very nice prof.", "I love mrs Fitzpatrick psych 25. She's very caring a bit of a calling in sick but if you voice your concerns to her she will help you pick up grade. She's funny. her tests do match her 3 exams. a lot of reading. she lets you use a cheat sheet on test easy A. very accessible on line and in office. she's overall very relaxed happy all the time.", "This professor goes too fast and has high expectations.", "Greta can been intimidating from the start. But she is an incredibly knowledgeable instructor who really does want her students to engage and interact with the material. If you get past the intimidation, you can learn a lot from her.", "Cynthia will see you for what you are. Don't take her classes if they're a check in the box for your degree program. But if you're passionate, and actually care about the subject matter, Cynthia is an incredible leader help you realize your goals. She WILL let you know if you aren't cut out for the field. Which is a much needed trait in a teacher", "This woman can not only NOT teach effectivly, she can not clearly communicate or abstractly think. Her grading is unfair and her lectures disorganized. Sje decided DAYS before midterm to get a book, and then changed which book we needed twice.", "She is way too harsh when grading her essays. I never made below a 90 in my English class but I got 60's on my essays in her class. She thinks she's an English teacher apparently. I had to dumb down my essays to get an A. She did, however, let me re-write my essay, so she isn't heartless.", "The good news: Wendy is smart and witty. The bad news: She knows it. At first you laugh along with her, and then you realize how condescending she's being. She has no respect for RISD and insults it all the time.", "No Comments", "There is a good amount of homework, although if you read up you'll be fine. She doesn't teach much in class, mostly YouTube videos and she jumps from slide to slide without explaining how they relate to another. TESTS are ridiculously hard and confusing. Half of the content has never been gone over or even mensioned. You're in for a ride.", "I would definitely recommend this professor. Took her inter comm class and got an A out of it. Although she is friendly and fun in class, do take her deadlines seriously.", "Great teacher", "She knows writing, but not how to teach it. I think her new personal life is getting in the way of her job and she is not able to successfully teach her class. Everyone I've talked to about it hates/hated her class because her grading is ridiculous and she is sometimes unorganized and unprepared. She loses some of your assignments as well--no mercy", "Enthusiastic, intelligent, and interesting! Professor O'Mahony teaches very well and is a good marker. She is always willing to help and she is well-read in her field. Recommended!", "I will advise you to wait for 2 years for a better instructure rather than to take her class. She is inexperienced and does not answer questions correctly, rather, she will give the question for an xtra credit. What a nightmare she is........", "Best teacher ever!", "Cynthia is completely scatterbrained. She adds new assignments randomly and due dates change all the time, so you get confused by all of her confusion. Takes forever to grade. Exams hardly reflect lecture at all. Talks above what most people even know yet, like we are already microbiologists, when we're actually there to LEARN.... Horrible teacher.", "Kathy is so much fun. But if you want to do well you much keep up and do your assignments on time. There is a lot of Internet videos to watch, many with her in them. They are a crack up, but you do learn a lot from them. Lots of work, but it is always fun. She is a great teacher.", "Ask a question and she'll spend five minutes giving you a non-answer. Definitely got a second-waver feminism vibe from her.", "Holy crap! Can Q.C.C please hire a translator?!? She can't teach but is still an easy A.", "The professor explains and lectures on material in a way that can be easily understood. She Is more than fair with questions, grading and extra credit. Gives great handouts for note taking.", "she is a very good teacher", "It was a fun class and she is okay. She just thinks she is a little better in some sports than she really is. Keep it cool Doc, you are not going to win all the time.", "She's very hard teacher. She expects everyone to know everything. She doesn't help at all. very mean and very rude. Tests are hardest!! Don't take her. I hate this teacher. She doesn't teach that much but she gives a big project that didn't mean a lot.", "Dreadful...Absolutely dreadful course.", "Great professor, enjoyed every class.", "I really enjoyed her class! I undertood her teaching style, she was clear in her directoins and she helped me become a better writer overall. She does asign a lot of papers but she grades quite easy in my opinion. I would take her again.", "If you are a feminista who is tired of reading the important works of America's past, sign up for Michelle's class. It is difficult to make a class of alternative voices relevant and interesting, and this is no exception. I'm all for diversity, but the sad fact is that there just weren't very many interesting/well written pieces by women/american indians/slaves but you will read many by tem anyway.", "I hope it is the teacher im talking about. She is a college prep teacher and I hope she reads this, I DIDNT LEARN ONE THING IN YOUR CLASS. you are way too repetitive and you care too much about attendance in the first place. Her teaching skills are HORRIBLE! Half the time she doesnt even know what shes talking about. conclusion. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!", "Great teacher, knows what she is talking about. Super nice and funny, explains things clearly.", "She is the nicest person that anyone would ever meet in this world! The work is easy, all you have to do is read poems and write responses for them! You get a couple of major papers but all that matters is the grammar and not so much the content. But if you are completely off subject in everything you write, your grade might suffer.", "I liked her, easy class nice professor", "She is brutally honest when it comes to critiquing work so at first I was afraid she would be a hard grader. I found her critiques to be helpful and her grading fair and even a little generous. She is opinionated, but tolerant of others' opinions. If you prefer the standard lecture class, she's not the professor for you.", "I despise math with a passion, but this professor made it livable and really not so bad. Really willing to help and very good at making you understand what's going on. If you really try then your grade won't be horrible. If you need a gen ed take this professor.", "Easiest class I've taken, but also the biggest waste of time. Didn't learn anything. We met most days and just watched her search on google. She was not prepared. She has an open door policy, so she will always help you. Good at giving advice, but bad teacher.", "Miss Mitchell made my semester. I really ought to talk about her knowledgeability and the way she makes the material fun and interesting to the vast majority of disinterested students, but all that pales in comparison to my huge crush on her. Shew. Yeah, she really kills me. I'll leave it at that.", "Great Professor", "SHOW HER SOME RESPECT, DO YOUR BEST, AND YOU WILL PASS THIS CLASS WITH EASE.", "I agree that she is gentle and kind, and she is also professional. The work isn't too hard and the lectures & class discussion cover the readings in case you didn't do them. Lots of videos and discussion which is a nice break from taking notes on your knees since the sh*tty SdBI only has couches, not desks.", "Her actual class was not bad we had interesting converstaions, and lectures were interesting. Attendance is 10% of your grade, so if you plan on attending class thats a plus. You have 3 TEN page papers in this class, the rubric is not great, she is impossible to get a hold of, and if you do poorly she gives almost no feed back or reasoning.", "No NO NO at all....", "Very passionate about what she teaches. Have to buy TopHat for participation. Point Based System. To get an A you have to get 340 points, she offered 860 points! Her quizzes are online but very short. 10questions in 8mins so no time to use book/notes. Very easy to get A if you just PAY ATTENTION.", "Waterhouse was great. She is very nice and very helpful. Granted it is english so it obviously is going to be a little slow at times but she tried her hardest to keep students active and interested. Only had to write 4 papers and take a few tiny quizzes. She did ramble on a LOT about nothing at times. I would absolutely take her again if i could!", "I must say that I agree with all of the posts everyone has done. I was a TA for her class and she not only sloughed everything off on us (including the grading), but she posted the grades we gave her late - wreaking havoc on my financial aid. Really, this is a dangerous situation for serious students or anyone wanting to learn.", "well organized course, good lecturer, shows interest in topic, easy papers", "Jackson is the most convoluted teacher I have experienced thus far. She contradicts the book and herself on a regular basis. Her instructions are never clear. When you ask for help she is snide and rude. Not the MOST difficult material, but she makes it unbearable. She also is never timely on grades.", "SHES GOOD, THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAID HER CLASS IS HARD DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. ITS EASY, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ. SHE GIVES QUIZZES EVERY WEEK ON THE READING. A PAPER FOR A MIDTERM AND A FINAL WHICH IS COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THE CHARACTERS FROM THE BOOKS SHE ASSIGNED. SHES EASY.COLLEGE IS ABOUT DOING YOUR WORK.", "Very defensive personality. She wants her students to have her opinion, not their own.", "Nice, but not very specific on what is expected. She DOES NOT use canvas. She does not know anyone's grade unless you ask. And she will give you an estimate rather than figuring it out. You need to read the text often to prepare for reading quizzes. And when she lectures, she speaks in a monotone voice and reads from the book with no elaboration.", "AWESOME teacher", "No way, Jack. Avoid at all costs!!!", "Absolutely horrible!! She doesn't know how to teach. She teaches word for word out of the book and when you ask a question she won't answer it. Avoid this professor if at all possible. If she doesn't want to answer your question she will yell at you and kick you out. Totally pointless to even show up for class. I can teach better than she can!!!!!", "She is funny in a sarcastic way. Lectures are all over the place because she is clearly passionate about her class but the tests are easy with minimal studying and before every exam she does a review.", "way way way too much work. completely unneccessary amount of work considering it has nothing to do with anyone's major, and distracts you from the classes and assignments that matter. absolutely terrible", "here is a teacher who really has the proverbial head up the proverbial sewage pipe.", "The BEST!!!", "If you can take this course with someone else, do so. She takes herself too seriously. The lectures are dry and boring.", "Rebecca has a brilliant mind, she gives great lectures. Regardless of what others say, I find her very approachable. And, yes, she deserves a chillie pepper ;)", "Horrible Teacher. Her Daughter is a reflection of her stupidity.", "No Comments", "Too many formal papers not a good instituion. If you quailfy to attend UBC make sure you go there", "DID NOT LIKE her section of the class. Her portions of the tests were much harder and she does not upload feedback for assignments as the other instructor for this class did. Overall a very poor quality teacher!", "Dr. Sinning rocks my world! She has the patience of a nun, this woman is a SAINT. A total blessing to WMU, students are lucky to have her teaching. God bless this woman. The BEST professor I have EVER had. My only gripe is that she doesn't give enough room on the exams to work out problems, you have to write really small. Oh well. Dr. Sinning ROCKS", "Ignore her lectures, read the book. She is well-meaning but her lectures are abysmal. I got fed up and just resorted to relying on Wikipedia for key terms and concepts. A full semester later and I ended up teaching myself. Very exhausting for people not familiar with programming.", "Awesome Teacher. Learned a lot from her.", "an amazing woman to know. one of the greatest teachers the B.A.C. will ever have", "She is amazing. Her wealth of knowledge is limitless. She is an inspiration in every aspect of life. I want to take every class she has every taught. She's awesome. Honestly. Doesn't like technology though. And she's still busy writing the book on the subject.", "loved her. tough, but fun. gotta work for grade, duh!", "Exteremly biased against Israel. Even though she claims to keep an open mind, she presented one side of the struggle in the middle east, and provided little voice for the other side to make its case. This class does not present a fair academic look at this complicated situation.", "i LOVED nike!! she's a lot of fun, at the very least.", "She's a great teacher and she's hilarious! I love her class.", "Wow this lady is crazy. She wears the weirdest clothes and never wears two of the same shoe. If you have taken algebra before, this class will be simple. I only went to claa for the 4 tests and got an A because I knew the material. She makes a lot of math mistakes, so its hard to trust what she says. She lets you retake a test if you want.", "Orella's EWRT 1B class is the worst online class I have taken. She makes no effort to explain anything, let alone teach, and her comments on papers are vague and unhelpful. If you want to learn anything about writing, you are in the wrong class. If you want to work very hard for a low grade and be on your own, this is the class for you!", "HORRIBLE. SO MANY PAPERS. SHE IS A TOUGH GRADER! At least 5-8 papers due EVERY SINGLE WEEK! I'm not sure if it is different in-class but I will never do this again.", "This is the easiest class an ME major will take and Dr. Todd makes it a lot of fun. You really have to try to not get an A+.", "Colleen Whitley is so awesome! She is such a sweet lady and gives students a very fair chance. She is willing to help you ALWAYS. She changed my opinion about writing and she'll change yours too! Take her college writing class if you are interested in becoming a writer, she'll help you on the way.", "I had Judy Gregg for Psych 206 as well as child 114. She is an amazing teacher, very helpful, clear and has great style! I totally recommend her!", "I am not a fan of Dr Newhart at all. As interested as she is in philosophy, and as knowlegeable as she is about the subject, she does not know how to express it to her students without giggling a lot at her own jokes. I have to take notes hardcore when she teaches because her lectures do not sink in at all.", "She's a nice lady. But she needs to understand that we have more than just the one course! We can't always keep up and read ahead before we go to her class. But she thinks that you dont do work at all just becuase you cant answer her questions in class. I'm still an A student in Spanish, but I have lost my interest in this language.", "Great teacher! Very funny and easy to talk to. I have her for SOC 131 right now. You don't need a book, unless you want to read more in detail, otherwise she writes everything you need to know on the board. She takes attendance randomly, but if you don't go to class, you won't get the notes anyway.", "Ms. Hardesty is AWESOME! This class is a breeze and the only really big assignment is the group project. Other than that it is notes and tests! She is so nice and helpful! She is hilarious also. She hardly ever has class on Friday!", "I GOT AN A-. I TOOK HER TWICE!", "A good lecturer, and a fair marker.", "the assignments were extremely easy but she tried to trick you for the tests which made them impossible!", "really really easy. she's nice", "NEVER TAKE HER! thanks God she's not teaching next semester because I have to retake her class. Makes students feel stupid which immediately drops my interest in the class, very hard grader (to a ridiculous point) and gets confused in her own words, which confused everyone because we don't even know how to approach the problem. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE", "Dr. Chen is an excellent professor! She cares deeply about the success of her students and she is always willing to help. Pay attention during her lectures, take notes, and ask questions. She is the best professor I have had a Ball State.", "I loved Dr. Renick-Wood's class! She is so personable and knowledgeable about children with special needs. She has the greatest stories and makes class so interesting! She is funny and she also doesn't keep you in class for the whole 4 hours like some professors do. She does require alot of reflections but I least learned something in the process!", "Prof. Campos is really nice. She will work with you if you miss class. Office hours and communicating with her helps. You need to pay attention and not skip class. Exams and papers are not to be taken lightly. I learned a lot from her. Whoever complains about her class is just lazy.", "I haven't had her for math in college, but I did in high school. I've never had a teacher who went so far out of her way to help students as she did. I sucked at math and she was infinitely patient. One of my favorite teachers...period.", "She is good, you will learn alot", "Decent professor in class but the best outside if you need help. I've never had a prof try so hard to make sure her students understood the material. Genuinely a really really nice person and truly passionate about teaching", "Best professor ever.", "One of the nicest and helpfull professors at the college. She also is very intelligent and understanding.", "She is like the little grandma that everyone wishes they had. She wants her students to pass and will help them make that possible. If she sees your effort, she will work with you. The whole semester was spent on writing the final paper, by building it piece by piece. She's funny and really helpful.", "No Comments", "Woody is overall a great professor; she always came well prepared, her lectures were pretty interesting, and she was eager to hear student's input. She is definitely one of the few professors that really want her students to learn something, and is very helpful. I would highly recommend her!", "Yeah this (expletive deleted) is evil. SHe tried to get a friend of mine thrown out of school because of a \"mis-cited\" quote. If I were any of you underclassmen contemplating taking her, steer faaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrr away.", "Great professor. I'd spend sometimes up to half an hour after class badgering her and she'd answer and discuss every question whole-heartedly.", "Tough grader. Thought the class would be easy and didn't work to improve my writing as I'm not pursuing a degree in the humanities. If you're serious about becoming a better reader/writer/essayist, I would highly recommend her. Nice person and seems passionate and knowledgeable. Take your essays seriously. She is not impressed by stoned rambling.", "She's an academic with no real personal experience in any of these issues. If you want an easy grade, and work is paying anyway, why not?", "Tells great stories! They are more insightful than anything I learned for the text.", "Chemistry is a difficult subject especially for those who have no interest in learning chemistry and are required to take the class. You have to study and put in a lot of work outside of class, simple as that. This is not a class that you attend lecture, review notes before exam and pull off an A or even a B. Not happening. STUDY! Nice lady.", "Horrible, horrible \"professor\"! She hardly every smiles and when she does it's very rare because 90% of the time she is yelling at her students like they\"re children!

I can honestly say I hate her!", "Fun Class, Can Be A Little Rude At Sometimes But I Had Fun, Your Required To Go To 3 Shows and your final is a group project or by urself.... Class Got Me In Shape... I had Fun", "I loved that woman so much that I can't even put it into words. Hands down, one of the best instructors I have ever had in my life. She is not unreasonable in any way. She gives you clear instructions and pushes you to not be a procrastinator. She is incredibly lively and hilarious and her lectures are rarely boring. Take her course! That's it.", "She is very fun teacher !!!! Can be a little tough but nothing we can't deal with. Speaches are not too hard. Good advice- choose the topicks you care about otherwise she gets upset!!! I would recommend to take her class! She also lets you out of the classroom earlier !!!!", "Julia is the hottest teacher I've ever had. That smile, those eyes and . . . .", "Gay is a wonderful professor! I have taken her for two courses (ARH 390W and ARH 498). Each course consists of 2 papers and 3-4 Image Exams. Class consists of her opening with a fun video and lecturing with a PowerPoint. No notes need to be taken, she practically gives you the exam on the study guide. Great class and great professor!", "Awesome. Very helpful and organized. Kind person, so don't be afraid to ask for help. Always looking out for her students. Knows what she's doing.", "Mrs. Weeks is great. She is so helpful and nice! Her papers actually have cool topics that interest you. She is flexible on paper deadlines which can ease a lot of stress. Take this class for sure!", "Professor Hall is very nice and helpful, but her class can get boring at times. All the homework is on the syllabus and usually it's due once every other week. When homework is due you have a quiz. Sometimes she gets confusing, but as long as you keep up with the work you'll get a B.. will have to work a little bit for an A.", "I Love Dr. Downes. Very personable. Easy to understand.", "She was difficult for a 100 level course. Four tests all semester including the final. Not difficult at all as long as you do the work and take the notes. I loved her! Great personality.", "Its an easy A", "I don't know where to start or end. Her class is definitely not fun, but she is very very clear. That's probably good, especially in math. If you are interested in a hardcore math class, take hers. She is the chair of the math and computer science department so she misses some days too because of meetings. Overall, I would rate her a b-. The rest i", "I'm pretty sure you're given an A+ just for registering. This class requires no effort what's so ever but then again I didn't realky learn much. Easy A", "Andrea Neves was one of the best professors I ever had. She taught me that if you have high expectations, you'll get high performance. She is a fighter for students who are disadvantaged because of their socioeconomic backgrounds. She is simply an amazing woman.", "Great teacher! I loved this class . . . there were a few topics she went through a little quickly, but other than that she was very easy to understand.", "this rating serves to confirm the evaluations of others. it doesnt matter how well you've done in other classes, how high your gpa is, or how much research you've done before. THIS CLASS WILL BE USELESS and ANNOYING. Don't take it. Wait another semester and take it with someone else. She is the worst professor I have ever had.", "A good teacher, very good at what she does, but pretty ****y and often misses class or things come up in personal life.", "The guys love her. She is a pretty good, but not a great teacher.", "I think I took as many classes as I could with Dr. Tromp. She taught me how to write and how to think in the most creative and intense way.

The book work gets alittle hard but its not her making it up!", "Fantastic teacher who is very interested in her students' futures.", "The nicest and most helpful teacher that I have ever had. There is a lot of work to do but she explains it so well it really is not that bad. You will have to do the same amount of work in this class whether you take her or not. But in my opinion you could not get a more helpful professor.", "Do not take her. It will be the best decision you ever make. Class is extremely boring; all she does is sit at her desk and read off her notes. You don't even have to read the 8-9 books she assigns. Her teaching style is inexplicably flawed. Some aspects of this class are useful/interesting, but you will regret taking this class with her.", "Keep looking. Not helpful and a terrible teacher. She is not flexible at all (even if you want to work ahead for one week). I took her online course and I DO NOT recommend it to even an enemy!", "So much stiumlating info on teaching. I'm a better teacher because of her. She goes the extra mile but expects a lot from you.", "Wonderful professor. Truly insightful on Russian politics and society. I learned an incredible amount on the subject; her lectures are very well organized and full of information. She is incredibly open to students' ideas and inspires us to think in novel ways.

Take Greta :)", "she doesnt know what shes doing", "multiple choice right from the book", "Joann is awesome! hilarious, quirky, and passionate. I would say this: there is A LOT of material covered but she only tests you on a quarter of it. follow the notes provided in the syllabus and you'll be golden on hw and tests. Also, if you're lazy or too special ed to do fractions then skip this class and take earth science or something.", "Gel is really a great teacher. Knows the material backwards and forwards but has a way with personalizing the material as well. She knows what it's like to be a student.

Make sure you do the main points and listen to lecture and youll be fin", "Very enthusiastic. Is eager for students to succeed. very fare", "She is an inexperienced Professor, who basically reads an outline, and poses questions to the class throughout class.

She offers extra credit and grades easy. She is very clear about tests. One question quizes. A great teacher. She is a real person.", "Her class was offered to me through APUS. She was very helpful, though there were quite a bit of essays and you truly had to try for your grade. We also had to read a novel chosen from her list for the final essay. BUT-- her grading on the final essay was very lenient.", "Dr. Ochshorn is such a sweet lady. The class is based around 4 essays which are easy as long as you put in a little effort, then there are readings due every class with pop quizzes that are easy if you read (drops lowest quiz grade).

Very good looking!", "She is a very fair grader and all assignments are fair. She is also very nice and helpful.

Will go out of her way to help any student.", "She sucks. Totally stupid. jumps around and never gets to the point. It's May and she still has no idea that no one cares about her or her class.

If she doesn't know the answer, she'll ignore your question or pretend that she does.", "This teacher will talk your ear off during every class, some of it relevant to the subject.

She's an excellent teacher; she's passionate about her work. If you are a baby and don't like to learn, write (not that there is a lot of writing involved), or work, I would suggest avoiding her. She's probably one of the best teachers at SIUE.", "Take her! She gives a few concept notes and examples on the board. Point out a mistake and she is cool about it.

She has a Turkish accent, but is very understandable.", "Unfair and discouraging, a very hateful person", "For this class your homework consists of writing a paragraph about some type of engineering based topic. If you show up you are pretty much guaranteed to pass. The hardest part of this course is attending two Engineering Society meetings, which is a no-brainer.

Also the style of her teaching makes people more focus on it. therefore, i would like to recommand her.", "Great teacher, im taking her class right now and that is the best class i have this semester.

Best professor Ive had.", "One of the better professors at AU.", "Nice lady, not a great prof. She has a lot of interest in the subject, but she doesn't really know what she is doing. Forgets everything (including to show up for class). Tries really hard to make other people agree with her opinions.", "She was very nice and her class was easy enough. Two take home exams (that you'd need your book for) and three paper, all of which being relatively short. She does get a little sidetracked during her lectures, but not too much to not get through the notes. I would definitely take her other courses she's teaching if need be.", "ALWAYS very helpful.

Would not recommend skipping any lectures. But she is very useful at office hours and responds to emails quickly. I think the tests are fair and she prepares you for them in lectures. Plus homeworks are very easy and are good grade boosters", "Awesome teacher!", "Dr. Fressola is a cold, vile human being who spews venom from her mouth on a regular basis. Not sure why BCC or any hospital continues to keep her on the payroll.She gets her rocks off of making students cry. You will not learn anything if you have her, except how to be afraid.

The class is passable, you just gota put up with her ranting and insanity.", "She is one of my favorites. if you can't learn in Dr. Toth's class you just can't learn.

Presentations weren't bad, just nerve-wracking.", "Her classes can kinda drag on but she's nice and very helpful if you don't understand something. *IF* you do the homework the class is easy and honestly attendance will not be 100% necessary.

But I would take her again.", "If you have any other time commitments or don't have a good foundation of Spanish already then you are in for the worst class of your life.

Half the time, I didn't understand the purpose behind it.", "This class is pretty easy if you try. For the tests if you know everything on the study guide she gives you then you will do well.

I highly recommend her.", "If you want to hurt your GPA then you can take her she is horrible a quiz in every class and the final paper is 7 to 10 pages", "I absolutely loved coming to this class!! Sherry is such an awesome teacher! =) She made learning ASL very easy. Her facial expressions were hilarious!!", "Overall pretty good prof. Her lectures can be pretty dull, but you have to remember it is accounting. Pay attention to her lectures and do the homework. She is a generous marker, so on tests make sure you write whatever you can as she gives part marks (she even hinted at this during a test).", "My absolute favorite professor at EKU. She is incredibly kind and caring towards her students, will always make time outside of class and welcomes questions. She is extremely well versed and knowledgable in her subject. Dr. Sweely by far has had the most impact in my academic career. It was an absolute joy to have her as a professor!", "She was a good teacher. You can ask lots of questions. Sometimes she's a little unorganizd but she is very helpful. I'd take her again.", "Wendy Ho is definitely a professor who cares about her students. She is accessible, approachable, hilarious, passionate and truly a one of a kind professor. She takes the time to get to know her students and is encouraging. Yes, her assigned readings and essays are challenging, but she teaches so much and is a great resource. I loved this class.", "Had her for internal audit and thoroughly enjoyed the class and her teaching style. The exams and group project count for the majority of your grade, so don't take those lightly. She provides handouts for her lectures, and if you study those you'll be totally prepared for the exams.", "Professor was awesome. I took the hybrid class (Lecture online, Monday lab only). The test can be difficult but if you do the homework and the study guides online, you will pass. Make sure to show up and do the extra credit. One of the best teachers I've ever had and one of the easiest going and understanding professors I know. Thanks professor!", "She's a great teacher! I loved her class. She tells great life stories. If you can take her for anything, do!", "One of my favorite teachers. Always willing to help you and is available after class if you're having trouble. Definitely recommend taking her.", "professor Lourdes is a great teacher she cares about you, gives test but very simple, tries to be funny and the homework is very simple and its online. i recommend any one to take her. you do not need the textbook but you do need the access code.", "probably the best prof I had all year :D", "I loved her as a professor, really nice woman. Tests aren't hard, although the essays can be difficult, but take it to her office hours and have her read it, she will tell you what needs to be fix. Gives opportunities for extra credit here and there.", "Mrs DeCerbo is a really good teacher. At first I wasn't so sure how I would like her, but she is actually quite funny! You need to be in class to understand some of the topics. She is helpful and brings in some great guest speakers! Love her!", "This prof has tremendous personal experience and willingness to share it. While we do not always agree, she has my respect for believing and doing what she feels is right. Those who would criticize should walk just one measly little mile in her shoes.", "no intellectual bullying..i liked this", "Sue is a very nice person but sometimes it feels as if the only right way is her way. She can definitely be a very hard Prof. and she makes you work. Although, she puts a lot of emphasis on class participation which is nice.", "Dr. Farrer is a terrific teacher! She cares about her students, and wants them to do well. She teaches the material in the class very well and in a way which most to all of her student grasps and understand it. I would recommend taking Dr. Farrer in all the classes you can.", "Very nice! Funny and very helpful. She is one of those teachers who is willing to help you all the time. She is very nice.", "An amazing professor. Very energetic and obviously passionate about the course. Lectures are nearly always very interesting. She knows how to interact well with students, and seems very approachable. Gives very clear guidelines for quizzes. A lot of reading though, and lectures don't always touch on them much. Museum assignment is interesting.", "you never know what this prof is up to she is nuts I hated her and her class I fought sleep till I could not take it any more and dropped the class beware of the CrAzY LaDy!!!!", "Very nice prof and easy class to get a good grade if you do what she asks. Very easy to talk to and explains things clearly.", "She's an absolute sweetheart, and very clear. She will help you if you get stuck on homework. She's actually a dog trainer which is pretty rad. Her homework is mostly online with some paperwork sometimes. Print out the book (It will help, believe me). don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions.", "This lady may seem hilarious and bubbly the first time you take her class, but my oh my is she fake! her lectures i like \"whaaaat\" she talks way too fast for you to even take notes. Barely ever replies to your emails. Tough in Practicum. and her exams are way more difficult than u would expect because her lectures or so damn brief.", "Her usual feedback for discussions and essays are \"ok\". What kind of feedback is that? Takes off points but not explain why, thats not helpful. She is a hard teacher and a there is a lot of reading and writing plus some questions on exams are from the next chapter or not at all in the book.", "One of the easiest classes i have ever taken. I don't know how anyone ended up with less than an A in this class, really. Do all the work and show up to class and you get an A. Study for exams, they are very easy too. She is super smart and a Harvard alumni, even though she never mentioned it because she is super humble. Amazing professor.", "had to work knew her stuff", "If you are a Republican/Christian beware to hear some controversial things. She's pretty straight forward on what she wants from you. Your grade is based on book quizzes and film quizzes. She's a nice and caring person, but can sometimes inject her opinion too much. Everything is basically online except the midterm and final.", "She is easily the worst professor I've ever had and I am a junior. She has people essentially teach themselves every lesson or she teaches a lesson then \"gets tired\" and stops. Zero feedback on any graded item. Forces you to use WebWork, a completely outdated program that is horrible in every way. Lazy, poorly put together, and generally terrible.", "She's fine. She straight up tells you that she takes pleasure in making questions so hard that people will get them wrong.", "Agree with others. She favors some students over others. Her lectures are clear, but not exactly like the book. She goes into details with her experiences and knowledge. It is good sometimes, but bad when it's not relevant to exactly what to study for the exams. Overall, an average professor.", "She is the nicest teacher en so helpful and happy. Her classes are never boring. She is always prepared. You should def. take her.", "Not helpful to students. Doesn't really care about student concerns for the class. Dictator.", "Dr. Slusher deserves a lot more credit than most people give her. She is someone I look up to for her accomplishments in nursing. She is a professor that cares about the future of nursing and wants you to succeed. Slusher will prepare you for the rest of your nursing program and career. Lecture heavy, funny, intelligent, & has high expectations.", "Should have taken another course. Not helpful. Not relevant. Ideas are absurd. Content useless.", "I do not remember the course code, but the course was a 300 level and was intro to american legal systems. She was very cool and down to earth. She is not one of the professors who think that because they have a degree, they are better than you. Although the note taking can be confusing at times, she is magnetic and I would recommend to anyone.", "Enjoyed her classes greatly, Lots of work to be done but its worth it in the end. You can learn a great deal if you are just willing to do the work and try hard. Stop complaining about the work load and do it.", "Terrible.", "The discussion setup of HumanComm makes the class. A fair teacher, always wants to hear what every student has to say and will NEVER shut anyone down. Extremely nice and the class is fairly easy if you do your work. A lot of reading, and a few papers/tests over the semester. Readings are helpful, but only sometimes necessary around half the time.", "I was warned by a student that this lady was really hard on you. The work was a lot, and I was recommended NOT to take her class, but I did. I am so glad I took it. She is an awesome teacher, mentor, and person. She reminds me of my aunt. She is very kind and clear on her notes. I DO recommend taking her classes.Take a chance.", "She is incredibly moody and unfriendly to some graduate students for whatever reason. If you are not her favorite, she will not smile when she sees you. And if she is knowledgeable or an in your face feminist, then she needs to be more friendly so that students will want to find out what she is all about. I wouldn't want to study with her!", "She is super strict. If you do not complete something, be ready to be kicked out of class. She thinks her class is the only thing going on in our life's. She assigns mass amounts of homework to be due immediately. Random pop quizzes are huge. If you think you can come to class and review what you just read, forget it. You should know everything!", "I loved taking Professor Rising! the classroom environment is very easy going. her lectures are super easy to get through because she uses stories from her life to get through it as examples. really wish i needed other sign classes because i already miss her", "I still don't understand why I had to take her class.. but don't. She does not explain anything, you're basically on your own, she gets mad or aggravated if you ask a question that does not go with what she's teaching that day. If you have a question she will make you wait until class ends or she simply says \"you should have asked me before class\"", "Very clear teacher, very calm. She conveys all the material in a straightforward manner. She is approachable and open to questions. She doesn't show a lot of passion for her subject, but she certainly does a very good job teaching it.", "No Comments", "I have yasmin for spanish 10 and again next semester for spanish 20 and she is the best teacher I have ever had. She is so helpful and even brings breakfast for us on fridays. She really cares about her students and I have learned so much spanish.", "I took two courses with her in the same semester-I loved it! I couldn't have been more excited to wake up at 9 am. Her teaching method is to tell a story, sometimes making implications. Its like going to listen to your favorite aunt and have her show you pictures and tell you stories about them. Great professor! Fair grader", "Sweet lady, she should have been a writer. Not a good teacher, I didn't learn anything at all. Very easy, but very repitative and mundane work. Boring class.", "Very nice lady!! Definitely knows what she is teaching! As long as you study you will be fine in her class!", "Lisa's one of the most dynamic personalities I've ever encountered. She makes a very dry subject entertaining, and I learned a lot from her. If they don't offer her tenure, Brandeis will lose a real gem.", "I took her for fiction 1. Shes a great critic and will force you to improve your writing, but the class is not too hard. She also assigns great readings. Go to her office hours to work on your stuff with her. Shes even better one-on-one.", "Horrible Prof. Probably the laziest person to teach Personal Finance. Final was tough, doesn't provide proper feedback to questions, and worst of all, leaves it all on you. Do not take this class ever.", "one of the most exciting profs at U of T. and that's not just because she's so hot. which makes me wonder - where are all her chili peppers?! is anyone more deserving?", "I really enjoyed her class. She explained things clearly and efficiently. She is very approachable, and would even see me when there wasn't an office hour available. I didn't find her exams easy, but I feel that we were well prepared for them. I think UVic is extremely lucky to have her!", "whatever is written here is wrong. these kids are trying to get you to take a hard class. no kidding....its soooo hard, tests are impossible and there is sooooo much homework. DONT TAKE HER", "In tune with her topic. Great expeditor.", "No Comments", "Tests were easy for someone with science background and study slides. Hard if you do not pay attention. Stickler on class etiquette. You will get a good grade on the papers if you include everything she requires (she gives you a rubic). Wants to be able to read the paper without trying to figure out what you are trying to say.", "Not fully comprehend half of the time what she is saying. If you have not taken Spanish before or during high school, do not take her. She did not explain the materials really well. Her tests are easy if you know Spanish. 4 tests, drops 1.", "Excellent teacher... Common midterm for all sections and all her sections had the highest average. Her slides are super clear and so is her method of teacher. Would def take for Intro to Accounting", "I did not like this teacher because I thought she was a very unfair grader.", "Very Boring!!! She is elderly and soft spoken. Test are relatively hard; however, my suggestion is to take her as a hybrid class. You only have to meet 7 times and everything else is online. Also, study the slides over and over. On every test the time limit is really short.", "She is a great prof. Im a transfer & I have to say my other school (edu wise) was much better until I took Dean Willis class theres a lot of group work but thats preparation for us as future teachers we are going to make a community with others so we need to start now. I hope she doesnt leave shes the most helpful person in school of EDU undergrad!", "VERY NICE AND AN EASY TEACHER", "Dr. Carmean is my academic advisor and has helped me in so many ways! Her classes are by no means easy...but they are a lot of fun. You can tell that she really gets into some anthropology! If you have the chance you should take her...actually, make it a point to take her. You will not regret it...but you will work hard!", "She went shopping during class one time and expected us to stay the whole time to sew costumes!", "I love this lady! She is so helpful and patient with her students and always willing to help. The playing tests aren't bad and she's great at explaining things :-) I'm not a music major but I still take piano with her", "No Comments", "She is my favorite accounting professor at UNLV!", "Very friendly and helpful prof. I enjoyed the class, even if my own lack of effort put me behind at times. Class was always a lot of fun, and we usually managed to learn some things too.", "Dr. Hall is a genuinely nice professor. She will let you make up quizzes and homework with some leniency. Homework and quizzes are assigned bi-monthly without the use of a syllabus calendar. Rachel will say \"at any rate\" about 5 times per class. Very hard to wake up for this class if its at 8am.", "Great teacher. Easy homework assignments. Flexible paper due dates. Class is a bit boring and really no need to attend to get an understanding...but she takes attendance everyday so I would def go everyday. Overall, Great teacher", "I had this prof for both social theory classes and she is a great teacher. Has a very extensive grasp of theory, good relationship with students and very willing to help anyone who asks. She challenges enough to be considered tough, but not to the point where students are overwhelmed. A definite asset to the school and the department.", "Definitely one of my favorite classes while I was at Vol State. She made the class very fun to learn in. She is very cool and was very understanding about me having a class at another school. You can't be shy or embarrassed in her class, because she'll use her psychology on you! But if you get the chance to take her, take her. She is really cool.", "She's a very hard professor and she expects a lot out of you. The amount of reading is rather obnoxious and she expects that you'll reach a whole new level of learning just from being in her class. Sometimes she's funny and she seems nice, but I think she expects far too much for a survey class.", "Reynolds is weird. She gives you relatively easy papers to write, you write them alone, and turn them in on the day they are due. The ONLY time I went to class was for the first two weeks, and thereafter only to turn in my papers or have a grading conference. This teacher is not for anyone who is not self motivated.", "Amazing professor. My favorite professor at BA and main campus. Super friendly and extremely encouraging. Easy A. Uses real life experiences in her discussions. Everyone is always involved in discusssion which makes this class so fun to go to. She cancels class frequently and cuts class short which sucks because I love this class so much.", "Dr. Farrer is by far my FAVORITE professor at Cal. She will help you with ANYTHING. She really is there to help you succeed. Her class is a lot of work, but if you do the work you'll get an A. She is very organized and her class is fun! Take Dr. Farrer's class if you can!!!!", "A student and 2 year assistant. I know WBL. Positive: Dr. Leatham offers passable classes. Minimal effort decent grade. Knowledgeable. Online reading and exercises mandatory. Negative: Egomaniac. Avoids questions. Lectures off-topic. Often late. Humor, problematic when the focus is personal. Be careful what you say. It will be remembered.", "Great information. I learned a lot in this course. I would recommend this class for all preservice teachers", "reeeeaal snippy", "Took this class online. Not a lot of points taken so you have to keep up with your work. Read a chapter, post on discussion board come back 2 or 3 times after that to get the full 15 points for the week along with 5 points of that being just an opinion you submit to her. One research paper, midterm and final. Not too difficult. Interesting class!", "LOVED HER. she was my favorite professor EVER", "Professor Moore was amazing! Makes math super easy and explains everything very well. You do not need a textbook so you will save a ton of money!! I strongly suggest her :)", "You have to be organized to take this class! Not structured by week but by major assignment. Difficult if you don't already know how to write essays. Doesn't give feedback on rough drafts (peers do)only on your essay after its graded. Doesn't lecture - you learn by doing workbook sheets. 4 essays w/ rough draft, various exercises, online research", "I took this class at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee with her. It's a class about vampires and it is really interesting, but don't take it if you just want an easy course that doesn't involve much. If you like to read and write, than it will be super easy. Be sure to show up to class, though.", "She's the worst professor I've ever had at PCC. She basically copies the textbook to the board and she calls that a lecture. She wasn't even able to answer any questions. It really made me wonder why I was in that class. I DO NOT recommend you to take her even if you are good at math. Her class will bore you to death.", "easy A.short homework assignments due weeekly and easy midterm and final.", "Dr. Huntley is a wonderful instructor! She's not easy--she's a former lawyer. Our final exam was an in-class research paper. Inspiring teacher and true friend.", "Awesome professor! Lots to learn, but make sure you attend class. Exams are pretty tough but definitely fair, would highly recommend.", "This is a person who loves to teach almost as much as she loves to learn. Excellence.", "She is the most boring teacher i never had before....oh!~~~my GOD!~", "This teacher has high expectations of students but moreover has to be right all of the time. Careful what you say regarding disagreeing as it will bite you in the end. Try not to stand out. She likes to be the one who shines. She is very calucating.", "HER LECTURES WERE LONG AND BORING! TALKS WAYYYYYYY TOO MUCH! CLASS IS OPTIONAL, BUT BE THERE FOR LABS TO PASS! TEST WERE ONLINE, BUT WE PROBABLY RUINED THAT FOR FUTURE CLASSES. BE PREPARE TO SPEND 100$ ON THE BOOK FOR HOMEWORK! FINALLY BE PREPARE FOR LENGTHY HOMEWORK WHICH INCLUDES READINGS AND MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS.", "Dr. Carnes cct 201 class is hard, THAT is all that can be said. I am an A and B student and It was really tough to pull out a \"b\". By talking to her, you would think she built the entire college with her bare hands. She also bad mouths other professors in the college of business, which I thought was terrible to do in the classroom. Do NOT take her!", "For a second year sociology course I thought she asked for quite a bit more than any other soc class I had taken. Because so many people complained, she made the final super easy, but her teaching style is often difficult to follow.", "Does not use canvas, very unorganized, loses papers, does not know what to do, unclear instructions!! No drop boxes, no grades online, doesn't even say our grades when we ask \"you will know by the end of the semester\" is what she says!! Very unfair what if someone is failing! Also does not reply any emails! VERY not recommended! Waste of $ and time", "His test have nothing to do with what he leactures about (if you can call it lecturing). Our final was about 112 question long. He tries to \"Stand and Deliver\" the class, but fails miserably. There is no organization! This class is not hard, but it adds so much stress to your life. You're basically in limbo the whole time with your grade. Stay away", "Great teacher. Very smart and entertaining!", "The class is really boring, and she is no help at all. I went to her office a few times and that was just a waste of time. The final project is kind of interesting. Tests weren't too bad if you knew your stuff.", "No Comments", "She is a good teacher and the material in book are helpful for exam. I think it is not a difficult class to pass if you do homework carefully.", "Monica is by far the worst employee at UVic. She is rude, unclear, and makes these labs as hard as she possibly can. I get why, it's to \"weed out\" the weak students who shouldn't be furthering their degree in Chemistry, but she makes it miserable to want to pursue, even if a student is capable enough. I received an A in 101, and am taking 102.", "Worst prof ! Avoid her at all costs !!", "Wonderful experience. Made a weekend class enjoyable and meaningful. She focused on real aspects of teaching and ways to improve the system.", "Absolutely terrible class. She's boring and extremely feminist. Only bonus given away is only for women and some things she makes mandatory have no relevance to the class. Complete waste of time", "Dr. Sinning is wonderful. She sent me pages-long emails with explanations whenever I contacted her with questions and is available outside of office hours if you need it. No doubt this is a tough class, but if you work hard and ask for help, you will be fine. Don't miss class or you miss out on A LOT.", "No Comments", "enjoyed the class. enjoyed the professor wish every one read the material", "She is hard, but a genius", "Sometimes she's interesting and sometimes she's boring but at least she makes jokes in class sometimes.", "very VERY hot!", "I like how she asks for feedback during the course.", "Reviews at the beginning of each class. Multiple choice tests. Easy paper. No book required, print 'fill-in' notes off of a website. Easy to get a hold of. Amazing and funny woman. Would DEFINITLY RECOMMEND HER! ...if you can't make it in this hist class..then WoW..... Beth Hilburn=Amazing", "This was a hybrid class for me and Feth was the online teacher. She responded quickly to email questions and if you read the chapters, took practice quizzes and attended your labs..the class was fine. The lab teacher was a different story and they didn't seem to communicate. Lab sheets were not graded in time for quizzes & lab teacher did not teach", "I liked her and she still remembers me. I would suggest sitting in the front row or at least be vocal during discussions. That's the best way to get a long with her.", "SHE IS TOUGH, HARD GRADER, AND WILL CLOSE THE DOOR ON YOU IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE LATE. AT TIMES HER CLASS IS BORING, AND SHE REPEATS HERSELF TOO MUCH. SHE HARDLY RECOMMENDS STUDENTS TO TAKE THE ACT TEST AFTER HER CLASS, AND NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T DESERVE IT. IT WAS HARD TO PASS THIS CLASS, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU WORKED.", "No Comments", "WONDERFUL TEACHER!", "I definitely would not recommend taking her class. She is a nice woman but not the best teacher. She teaches the easy things pretty well but when it comes to the confusing stuff, she speeds right through it. She gives out way too much homework (online and worksheets) and doesn't accept any excuses. She is also very stingy about grading.", "Awful teacher! Not very helpful, rude and inconsiderate, makes things a lot harder than they need to be", "I love her I wish she taught all maths coming from a non math liker but take advantage of extra credit and you should pass TAKE HER TAKE HER TAKE HER it's was 8 weeks and I passed with a B and homework saved my grade giving that you can go back and improver score", "Professor Lape is such a sweet lady. She helps you understand the readings the next day you come into class by discussing with everyone. There are not many grades. Attendance does matter to her. There's one group project which could go either way based on the group you choose to be with. The exams are a little rough to study for, but you do well.", "Typical writing of papers every week. Kind of interesting when she went off on tangents. Not her fault that critical reading is very high school. I would take her again.", "She was nice, but way to bouncy for me. Everything had to be done her way exactly. She should realize there are different styles.", "If you are French or know French she will give you a good grade. If you are trying to learn French don't take her because she will not teach you a thing. Do not come to class sick she will discriminate against you.I think her attitude stinks and there have been many complaints against her.", "Class as entertaining as the disscusions of the topic, which at times were trite. But she does try to apply the class to modern day and mix up topics, history, politics, culture. Pop quizes on the readings, but they aren't tough. Eases up around finals, watching movies in spanish. I would recomend, but also depends on how interested your classmate", "This class is unbelievable boring. The quizzes are HARD and she no longer does tests. Quiz consists of 12 questions with 8 options for answers. She expects you to know details about everything you read so unless you are a theo major stay clear! Oh and she grades essays based on how much she likes you (for most of the class that means they failed)", "WONDERFUL teacher! I would recommend her to anyone. The project is the most important part of the grade so stay up on it. She will help you in any way that she can. She treats everyone the same and grades you by how hard you work. Anyone who says that Dr. Wall is not a good teacher has a severe attitude problem!!", "She cannot teach if her life depended on it. Someone else should really try to teach this course. She's a poor excuse for a professor as well as a human being. She makes DeVry look bad. I would have never fathomed that I would encounter such a professor.", "Very sweet lady but beware her exams are kinda hard. You can't put things into your own words it has to be exactly what she says or she will count it wrong.", "Sort of a tough grader but she makes her expectations very clear and gives a lot of good feedback", "she taught me to be a worse writer. her comments were most unhelpful, and her attitude in the classroom is condescending and self-important. don't try to disagree with her; it won't do any good. if you can avoid her, do it for your own good. take spaulding instead.", "Be forewarned this lady is hard, The other reviews are right she does look at you like you are dumb at times when you don't know something. The class is hard and her test are impossible.", "I love Mrs. Hampel! She is very helpful and is willing to do anything for you! She goes through the problems step by step and gives you easy ways to solve them. She really wants all of her students to do well! I definitely recommend her!!", "No Comments", "The lectures were so terribly boring. She was very unhelpful when I asked questions and seemed more bothered by my inquisition than anything else. Would not recommend.", "Although she is challenging, she is one of the better professors at RIC. Tests are crazy hard, and you have to be engaged in order to do well. She is really intense about grammar and writing because she used to be a writing professor. The papers are such a pain in the ass, if you are looking for an easy ride (slacker) do not take her as a professor", "Laidlaw was an awesome teacher. She is very enthusiastic with teaching and brings energy to class every day. She grades fair and easy. I would take her again if i had the opportunity!", "Best professor I have probably had at NIU.

Her lectures are super easy to comprehend and remember, she does review before every exam so its impossible to fail. She posts the textbook outlines on BB", "Dr. Todd is very helpful and nice. ME 121 is a very easy class, so easy that basically if you show up to class, then you will pass. There are in class assignments everyday so it is important to show up. The only work really outside of class is the 10 minute homeworks on Blackboard, and the two professional society meetings for credit.", "Loves to hear herself talk. Will get extremely offended if you use your phone in class, and will threaten to take your phone. The amount of work you have to do on some assignments for the amount of points the assignment is worth is completely skewed.

Very liberal and approachable. no need to buy textbook, just study wikipedia for the exams. everything is good except there is a long assignment to do ...", "Hard marker.", "PLEASE TAKE!! She is wonderful, very in tune with collge students and what interests them. I took her twice... LOVE HER!!", "Best professor I've had thus far. hands down. She genuinely cares about her students, and is an overall awesome person. The class is very discussion based so it's very lively and student driven. All of the things she expects you to know are in her presentations, so, honestly, there's no NEED to read the stuff she assigns but most is cool. TAKE HER!", "Was not a good teacher", "Dr. Asplin has to be one of the best professors at UPG. She is a wonderful professor and cares about her students. Dr. Asplin even cares about her students outside of her classroom and is easily accessible to her students. I am glad I took her for classes while I attended Pitt Greensburg. She was helpful when I took this course.", "I would recommend going to class. The material isn't necessarliy hard, but the exam review guides are vague and pretty much include everything. The SUA is time consuming, but if you double check with a group for each part you should be fine. She is very nice and knowledgable about the profession and what employers look for.", "Very good instructor. Sets goals and lets you know what is expected of you to suceed in her class. Very good at on-line classes. All future educators should take her classes to learn how to teach in the class room", "Dr. Priv is good. She is very outgoing, a little loud sometimes, but she is a fun teacher. She tries to learn your name even though it's a huge class which by the way makes people a little more shy than usual.", "She is an absolutely phenomenal professor. I really felt like I was taking a stimulating class with someone who is truly passionate in both her field and students. In class discussions, student ideas and opinions are both valid and encouraged, and out of any class I took this is the one that I always wanted to go further with. Take her classes!", "Very difficult to understand. Very unhelpful.", "Skips through power point slides in lecturesthen doesn''t go back to them but moves on to other power points. Doesn''t say much towards slides. It''s devastating how she doesn''t give time to write down info from slides. All she says is it''s on blackboard. How are we suppose to learn this way We pay to take the class. For what To teach ourselves", "Shes a good teacher. She knows her stuff & isnt easy. If you're in the class to learn you'll be ok. If you're there because you have to be, you'll have some trouble.She gives a lot of assignments. She really does care about the culinary students & she can be in a rush w/ everything she has to do at the school. your not just another student w/ her.", "This professor was absent many times. We had to rush with everything we learned, thus it was harder to comprehend. She walks into the room without acknowleding the class, i find that really rude. Personally i really did not like her and she made me hate speech class.She would have these outburst, it made me very uncomfortable.", "Okay so far I see that people are really harsh with comments. But to be honest, she isn't that bad. She doesn't do a good job at explaining, how ever she doesn't pile on the work and her test aren't impossible. Just read the textbook and she emphasizes doing end of chap questions which helped me. My biggest pet peeve was her blackboard.", "HORRIBLE. If you can change professors, then do it! She is so boring. She assigns 30-40 pages of reading a night. She is super snobby, and if you answer something incorrectly she basically laughs in your face. Attendance isn't necessary, but if you want to do good then read all of the assigned readings.", "We thought you needed a hot pepper.", "One of the best English professors I've taken. She is very helpful and will answer any questions you have and she makes class interesting. Harder class though, it takes work and you have to write a response paper to every reading. Essay exams. Attendance is mandatory.", "Best professor ever! She really cares about her students and art.", "She is passionate about her subject and it comes through in her teaching. Breaking down readings in class, encouraging students to voice their interpretations, giving clear instructions and guidance on her expectations for each assignment are just some of her strong points. Fab professor, approachable, great sense of humor. Prof Parameswaran rocks!", "HORRIBLE do NOT take this class. unclear, very boring. horrible class.", "Only anthropology class I've ever taken, and I genuinely look forward to it every week. She keeps lectures interesting, is extremely personable, and really knows her stuff.", "awesome prof. just participate athletically, show interest, help out, and you'll get an A", "Had the ENGL102 course with her as a 23 y/o transfer student, and quite frankly the lady can be rather catty. Overall, however, if you can support your views adequately, she is quite open minded to voices of dissent in the classroom. Also, don't take her", "She was a good instructor but really she didn't instruct anything. Everything was based off of your textbook and a \"lab website.\" I had some issues arrive and she wasn't willing to work with me outside of one instance. The only reason I wouldn't take another one of her classes is because its not really my thing. I didn't take much away from it.", "I've had her for two psychology classes, PSYC1030 and PSYC2130. She is an amazing teacher and she knows what she's doing. She also does her best to help her students and goes over the lecture thoroughly. I recommend any of you to have her if you can. :)", "Hard class with arbitrary requirements. Jams tons of info into her powerpoints and tests on the most random things, and is strict on papers and every mistake brings it down a letter grade. It's hard to do well in this class without studying like crazy. Ewa isn't helpful and feels that it's OK to expect the unreasonable of students. Don't take her.", "good teacher i enjoyed her class and i even met my exboyfriend in that class.", "UNFRIENDLY---DON'T LIKE MEN! BEWARE!!!!", "The easiest teacher ever! She cancels a lot of classes! Definitely an easy A! Class is a joke! Highly recommend taking her!!", "She's great & cute! She's my favorite teacher as her class is quite fun and clear.", "Hard readings in OLD Spanish. She has been helpful when I've talked to her.", "She is my favorite teacher at semo! Down to earth and witty and very practical... Her tests are easy and her lectures are interesting!", "She is an awesome professor!! I love the woman to death!", "Best teacher I ever had. Sad to see she wasn't teaching this semester.", "Professor Sipple is an awesome professor! She is very down to earth, wonderful, positive attitude about life in general and sympathetic to the college student's life. If you need an extention on a due date she is very understanding. Extremely helpful and encouraging to her students, she wants us to learn and succeed. I definitely recommend her.", "just say no!! she is horrible", "Wow, what a teacher! Cumpton makes English fun again. Yeah, you still have to write, but the assignments for both classes are simple and clear and she allows you to turn in writtings again.", "Do your work and you will love her.", "Always unclear as to what you should study for tests, which made them very difficult at times.", "Great teacher.", "Teaches German Noble Laureate, European Filmmaker, and Modern German Literature classes. She is an amazing professor who helps contextualize each work, making every class period extremely engaging. She doesn't give bad grades.", "Doesn't know how to teach...AT ALL. She expects you to read her mind. Don't bother to ask her questions in class, she doesn't know the answers. She likes to ramble on about her personal experiences. Easy A. Stupid assignments. Horrible teacher.", "The materials is hard no matter what, but the way she teaches and the material she gave out during class is horrible. Not much help during lab. Avoid....", "It was apparently her first time teaching MTH 227, and she didn't do a very good job of it (bad at explaining). I highly suggest registering for a different professor for this class. There are a lot of homework checks, and it doesn't really matter if you did it right or not as long as you attempted (not helpful for learning the material at all).", "Lectures are interesting, but she can be very close-minded. You need to go to class every day, no exceptions, you'll miss too much. Grading for papers is mostly fair, but can be fairly arbitrary at times. The tests are multiple choice, but with short answer type questions, which makes them tricky and sometimes potentially wrong.", "You have to make sure that you attendant class throughout the entire 8 weeks. Lecture is something that you don't want to miss because almost every week you have a quiz due that's based off lecture. Taking notes is always the best so that you can go over your notes and be sure to pass your quiz. Didn't use the book as much so i wouldn't get it.", "If you want a teacher that doesn't teach I'd recommend her, she gets paid way too much money to not teach us. She isn't good at explaining her content well and expects her students to keep up with her nonsense. I love learning and I've had plenty teachers and she is not one I would ever take again. If this allowed a 0 that's what I would put.", "The whole semester I was struggling, basically teaching myself with the book. He calls the book \"dumb\" but uses it for everything. If you go to every class and take good notes, he will look at the end of semester and note your good note taking, I was surprised to get a B, thought I failed...", "Mrs. Mitchell is definitely the best teacher I ever had. She is caring, motivational, and wants you to succeed. She is brilliant and gives amazing lectures. She can be a tough grader but clearly states what she is looking for. Be sure to participate in discussions, she loves that. MAM will not only teach you theatre, she will teach you life lessons", "terribly into her own ideas; not interested in helping students who don't want to agree with her every thought", "This course is taught in conjunction with David Rondel, and he is amazing. Mima however, although she is a sweet lady, is not an engaging lecturer, and her lectures are VERY difficult to pay attention to because of this. Definitely wish this course was only taught by Rondel.", "This class was TERRIBLE!!! She doesn't explain anything. She would be a great politician because every time anyone asks a question about what to do the answer has nothing to do with the question asked. Dont take her for any class!! not even underwater basket weaving!!", "Pretty rude and a unreasonable prof. Stay quiet,study when she says to study, do the homework and you should be fine. Her grading criteria is not to bad though, gives what you give to her. Still would not recommend her though!", "nice", "*", "No Comments", "great intro class. I had a laid back night class with her. Just real pleasant. Nothing crazy. No hitler teaching you. Just a laid back woman who likes to see you be creative. Wasn;t real hard at grading either. Very nice for this class", "If you don't understand, she will make sure to assist you after class. She asks if we all understand before moving to the next chapter and gives a few papers to review at home. She explains things very clearly.", "Passionate professor, the work is tedious but straight forward and not too difficult. She is a good professor; however, I'm certain no one made an \"A\" as her take home final was absolutely unreasonable. The entire class had worked on their final together with a semester's worth of notes collectively and all came out with low C's and D's.", "Didnt like her style at ALL! Too vague...has favorites and pretty cheesy!", "One of the best professors. She makes it very easy to understand the complex material in the class. The homework is really hard but the tests are really easy.", "If it weren't for the high school spanish class I took before, I would've done awful in this class. She's not the best teacher. I think you would have to spend a lot of time outside of class if you've never taken Spanish before.", "She's a nice lady and all, but seriously cannot teach for anything. She is bad at clarifying things, her blackboard is all jumbled up and confusing, and does not tell you what is due until the day of. if you want to be stressed out,confused and bored, definitely take her class. I advise not taking the class.", "I have taken her class(Span & 121) a year ago, and now I am taking her second class (Span & 122). She is one of my favorite teacher in NSC. This is because I learned so many valuable things through taking her class. I am now speaking 4 languages including Spanish. Just take her class if you are interested in learning Spanish.", "SHE IS AMAZING AND SO SO NICE. ALMOST EVERYONE GETS AN A IN HER CLASS, LITERALLY. VERY EASY TEACHER. YOU WOULD BE STUPID NOT TO TAKE CLASSES WITH HER.", "AWFUL! all you will do is collage and talk about feelings with people you dont know. goodness. i will not ever take a class from her again. shes very unclear about assignments and will never give you a straight answer. STAY AWAY!", "Sherry, you are nice and know a lot about ocean life. I liked it.", "I thought she was fantastic. Organized, thorough and fascinating. She was very punctual, always let you out early and was very clear on expectations. If you are one of those idiots who can't follow concise directions, or can't leave your phone alone for 45 minutes...do us all a favor and don't take her. If you can, you will love her!", "Cool teacher! Very funny at times and I enjoyed coming to class. However, when it comes to grading she is a beast. If you want to pass this class, I have three words for you: study, study, study.", "If i could I would pick Mima 100 percent again as a professor. Shes very decent, nice and understanding. Attendance is a must in order to get the marks.", "There is no required TEXT. Weekly movies with no homework. It doesn't get easier than this.", "Great teacher. She really explains the materials well. As long as you attend her class and pay attention to her lectures, you'll do great on the tests.", "By far the best professor I have ever had. Truly inspiring.", "Livingston is probably one of the worst teachers at PhilaU. Not only does she not teach, she grades extremely hard on the 2 test you have and fails the entire class. She is not a historian or a architect teaching architecture history. Do not take her class if you want to pass this course. highly unrecommend.", "julie is great, anyone who disagrees is just jealous, or very insecure about themselves. she shops for costuems for shows, you morons, not herself. i've had her for other classes too, and she's been nothing but professional and fun!", "Good professor.", "Great teacher. Very willing to help the students, always available for questions. Definitely the hardest FYS on campus, but she managed to make it a great learning experience. I feel much better about my own writing skills than I did before this course. She can be intimidating, but she is super nice.", "Rachel Edelson is easily the most engaging, inspiring English teacher I ever studied with. Her classes aren't easy, because she respects students enough to truly challenge them\u00e2\u0080\u0093and herself\u00e2\u0080\u0093to grapple with complex themes and reading material. As with any great class, you'll get what you put into it, so do yourself a favor and give it your all.", "Hasn't mastered basice grammar and spelling herself. Unbelievable that she was hired. Unfair grading and very defensive personality. Avoid this professor.", "She teaches in a high school style. She tends to be unclear, yet unrelenting while grading.", "She's nice, lectures are easy in the sense that there's no participation and we get out of class early a lot. She can be confusing though in lectures and rambles. We watched a lot of videos and had some guest speakers. We don't really have review sessions for exams and they're pretty hard. She won't go over exams with you after the test is taken.", "I am in her D.E class. It is the middle of the week and we still haven't received our H.W yet, but we are still expected to turn it in by the same deadline. I am really disappointed with this teacher because how are we expected to do good when you short us on our time to complete assignments? I'm so frustrated with her =(", "Shelly is by far the best she is very clear at the start what she expects and its up to you to so the work but she will go aove and beyond to help you with any problems you have I took her for 101, 102 and a lit class just because i enjoyed her sooo much take her you wont be sorry", "Lectures are not interesting, and she goes through the textbook word for word and does all of the textbook example problems. She takes homework questions and works out all of the problems you ask her to. The exams are much more difficult than the content she actually teaches.", "I absolutely loved this class. I showed up for every class session. You have to unless you have a friend who is willing to give you the notes since she does not post powerpoints online. She goes in depth and you actually learn the subject matter. The tests are literally based on the notes and questions from the study guide. Overall, she is great!", "as crazy as it seems, she actually helped me out with the final. all her crazy rambling on about all this weird stuff was exactly what i needed to know for the final. I just took the final and believe I did Extremely well!", "Solid professor. She teaches with a great deal of enthusiasm, which is great. And, she's extrememly understanding and helpful.", "If you want to waste an hour of your day or you just need a place to sleep i recommend this class because you'll just sit there and listen to her ramble on until you forget the topic of the discussion, she is a nice person and can speak of good topics but at the end of the day you'll wonder why you even went to class that day", "shes good. pure awesomeness!!!!!", "Betty keeps it real. dig the berets she dons. pay attention and show interest. old school teacher that lets you use notes for exams", "i don't know what everyone's talking about- she has you read and expects you to know what you read! def boring material, but she will love you if you raise your hand even once per class. there are some dates to know but she will tell you what to know. super helpful and understanding, id take her again!", "she is an egomaniac and she is crazy. unclear, never holds office hours, never seems to know where she is going when she teaches. i suggest avoiding her", "Awesome teacher. Keeps class interesting. You can use notes on the exams. Also a take home exam.", "Teacher does not realize when students do not understand and just ends up moving on to another problem or example I feel like there is no such thing as time to sit, rest, and think about what we just learned-there is no break time it is just go, go, go and if you aren't listening intently for even 5 seconds you will miss a great deal of information", "One of the worst Professors i've ever had. Her run on sentances make it nearly impossible to understand anything she says. She speaks like she is attempting to show off her vocabulary to the students she is supposed to be teaching. I suggest avoiding any class she teaches.", "English was one of my favorite subjects and I always did well..until Allameh's class. Unclear instructions, biased grading, and \"busy work\" assignments that did nothing but waste my time.", "we're suppose to learn and not to be more confused. this teacher blows.", "quizzes almost every week, but I would recommend taking Nohrden- she is a good teacher", "she has stinking attidude.she grades based on how she likes the person,and if u know some french automatically you will pass with an A.she insists on participation,and she catches an attitude if u want to be very clear on a topic.take prof.Alexandre for french.", "she thinks very highly of herself, isn't very approachable and an extremely hard marker. she also very obviously picks favorites. would not recommend this class unless you have a strange obsession with 19th century lit.", "She is not as bad as these people are saying. She is fun and if you do the labs(which are easy) and read the book, the class is a breeze.", "At first she seemed very enthusiastic about teaching the class. After a while she seemed to get confused and second guessed herself and wasn't very helpful a lot of the time. Outside of class she was pretty responsive. Other than going over homework questions and being redundant with lectures, I felt as if no one was really learning anything.", "The worst math professor I've had in my life, does not know how to teach. Most of the time she cant even figure out her own math problem that she created and she just looks at the problem all puzzled trying to figure it out when some students solve it first. Most of the time the students will solve the problem first", "She is very knowledgable and tries to communicate, but something gets lost", "I had her for aerobic walking...she's awesome, she would let us play basketball, tennis, anything if the weather was nice. Besides how hard can aerobic walking be?", "Professor Giampetro is honestly the sweetest lady ever. She gives a reasonable workload and is constantly there to help you. Don't listen to people that say she pushes propaganda and is bias - she lets everyone in the class say what they feel and is willing to listen to all opinions. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN. You won't regret it.", "Good teacher. She gave clear explanations of mark ups on papers. There is lots of reading, and you won't pass the quizzes if you do not read. You also need to pay attention to announcements and extra handouts. There is stuff not in the book that you will lose points for if you don't read the stuff she posts.", "Dr. Deguchi's class is NOT easy, because the subject (music theory) is not easy.

I could not have made it through theory without Dr. Deguchi.", "Great teacher overall", "Tries to be fair but does have her favorites.

It was an online class, she expects a lot, but it is great! The readings she selects are eye opening. I really enjoyed the class a lot and recommend you take her if you have the opportunity.", "She is an excellent teacher. I took her 6 week class in the summer. I had to work hard but I was never bored in her 3 hour classes. She teaches with power point, video, overhead, discussion and presentations all in the same class.

EASY and NICE!!:)", "If you actually read the material, and make the connections between the theoretical and the primary texts, you're golden. Prof Rohy makes every effort to help in this process. She answers emails always, and is more than not in her office. She's very, very dedicated; she's also very smart. Perhaps the most misunderstood professor at UVM.", "This class was absolutely horrible. Took her over the summer as a hybrid class. No one could ever get ahold of her...not even our lab teacher.

Im still waiting on my final grade to be posted..which was due yesterday by noon.", "it seems as if the only people who don't like her lecture style are kids coming straight out of high school and looking to be entertained and have information handed to them. she has a classical lecture style and she is very well versed in her field and open to questions. understanding of busy schedules & more than willing to help her students", "Professor Moore is a very friendly professor however her lectures are very unclear. She makes a lot of mistakes during lecture and although she corrects herself, it gets confusing. Her tests are extremely hard, and there was a quiz EVERYDAY!", "Susan is a great professor and offers a ton of extra credit. It is extremely hard to not get above an A- in this class. No attendance is taken, however, there are 12 quizzes throughout the semester. Most of the time you can use your notes, she provides you the answer, or gives you points for trying. This is a very easy class for a UP.", "Clear, funny, she cares about students, listens to student's and offers help.", "I have very few words to describe Deb.

Would definitely recommend her!", "Very Brutal Expects too much!!!", "Online class. Too many essays and lots of reading. 4 essays total and she isn't very helpful when you ask questions.

DO not take this class if you want lecture and tests and very specific information. DO take this class if you want to get out of the class what you put into it.

She gave us study guides for each exam. Very easy class. She does, although, have a strong spanish accent, but she is willing to repeat herself if needed.", "Awesome teacher. She is fun, funny and really helpful. Don't bother getting the book, it was never used. Only 3 homework assignments and 3 test which were easy if you paid attention in class and take good notes. Highly recommended", "Two words: DRAG QUEEN! She always sits there sucking on her teeth, and sighing throughout the student?s ENTIRE speech. She is a mess in a designer dress, despite shoddy attempts at professionalism, and is always complaining about her medication! She is an attendance HOUND, but missed 5 days herself last semester. AVOID AT ALL COST!", "Thee most toughest course you will ever take, this is coming from someone who is an Ed. major. This is a course where you actually learn and not be lazy. This professor is obsessed with the friendships. The critical issue for this course is that there is a lack of time. 3 hours per class would be perfect....I love this class! Why must she retire :(", "nothing you cant handle", "Great teacher!! Fun and knows her stuff. She was also a great advisor!", "She's nice, but pretty crazy. Guns Germs and Steel tests are horrible and the tests are hard. And seriously, she is CERTIFIABLE!!! But in a nice way :)", "In summer 2012, I took NIU's environmental field geology course. Not having gone to NIU before, I found the teaching style here dynamic and very hands on. Melissa is an excellent instructor and is very knowledgeable in her field. I recommend her field camp to any environmental science majors from any university.", "Dr. E is by far the best professor I have ever had. She helps you understand the Spanish languages so well and she is very very nice. I high suggest taking her if you have the chance. She spends so much of her time helping you, its crazy.", "Easy. If you do the work, you'll pass.", "if you have her don't expect to get a grade better than a B on any of your papers, and u better hope u don't have any family emergencies that you need to miss class for, she failed my friend for missing class b/c of a serious emergency", "Great professor!

You have to study A TON to get an A.", "Good class, hard tests,easy projects. Lets you pick your 4 best tests out of 5. Projects are fun and enjoyable. I would recommend this class/professor.", "Sassiest professor I've ever had. No drinks or food other than water. But, over all her class was pretty easy if you show up, do her daily reflections, and follow her syllabus to the dot. Lot of papers to keep up with. I ended up dividing mine by week in a binder.", "I had Queen B. last spring. We still chat and she is EXTREMELY helpful with career advice, even after you complete her class. Definitely worth taking speech class even if you don't need it!", "She is a really nice person, but her lectures are hard to follow. She kinda is all over the place. She takes forever to answer emails and is hardly ever physically in her office. However she gives lots of partial credit on test which saved me. If you dont do the homework or study you wont pass.", "No Comments", "A truly difficult and unhelpful teacher. Avoid like the plague!!!", "You either get it or you don't- basically the first grade you get it the grade you'll always get. I went to tutor after tutor and could not get more than a C+. You can't miss any classes for any reason, even one and she'll drop your particapation grade", "Mrs. Jackson is a character and she expects you to work hard. She explains her material clearly and gives a lot of hand outs. I would recommend her to someone who has been out of school for a while. You should pass her class with a B or better.. She is not a hard teacher and do not get on her bad side!!!!!!!!!!", "Although she is a very friendly person and tries her hardest she makes mistakes in every lecture which only confuses the students. She wants her students to do well but it felt like we were learning the course with her and not being taught the course. I do not recommend this professor.", "A class with Kate should be compulsory. She will expand your mind and educate you with skills and knowledge that will reach far beyond the classroom. Her \"Women and Politics\" class was my favorite during my time at USM. I carry the lessons learned with me in my life. Kate Greene: educator, teacher, inspiration.", "She's a prof. actress and teaches acting! Hello people...if you aren't a theatre major/minor then don't take her courses! If you ARE then you must take her courses,you will get great value from her knowledge and experience!

She's awesome and is like this course should not be hard. Her test are open book and she gives you the test to print out and write notes on.", "Boo AU, but Hooray Dr. Huntley!! Best overall teacher @ NACC in my opinion. I had Dr. H in both English & Lit classes. Register ASAP to get in her classes!!", "Very easy - just be nice to her and she'll love you. She has a little bit of ADD but is the best English teacher ever - her classes are extremly hard to get into - but so worth it!", "She is a hard grader. I've always had high grade in writting until her class. But if you want to graduate with an English Honors minor all you need to do is take 4 film classes. She gave me a B.

Not clear when explaining material and class is very boring.", "Great Teacher-loves typography, makes the class fun and environment friendly.Would take any class from her again!", "She is an awesome teacher!!!

I wish she is dead!!!!", "Sweetest woman on earth. super easy class.", "I feel that she really knows what she is talking about, and therefore manages to explain the subjects very well. She is helpful and makes sure that everybody understands the topic, yet one does not feel stressed or pushed.", "She is fair to all students. At the graduate level, she doesn't talk about attendance, but she still cares about it! She teaches molecular biology in a new way. Her stress is on experiment designing and techniques.", "summer session, If you go to class and do readings you will do well. She gave out 12 marks just for attendance. who can complain about that?", "The professor is a nightmare. I understand that the professor is merely to show you a path, then you go upon a journey to learn. But when that professor only gives you a hammer and some nails and expects you to build the titanic, that's when I can't respect her. TLDR: She gives you basics, but doesn't help you with anything else. Suicide For Grade", "i love her class. Mrs.Adams is always trying to find a way to help the student's grade go to its max. she is super fun and nice.plus her class isnt hard at all..", "he is a greeat teacher!! she bends over backward to help you. she is deaf so it encourages you to sign better even though she can lip read. wonderful class highly recomended", "No Comments", "LOVED Mrs.Everage! If you took AP Calc in high school this will simply be a refresher course. If you're struggling though, she's always more than willing to help you so go to those help sessions she offers. Use and abuse the online egrade practice quizzes.", "she was an ok professor i felt as though she was just a little to harsh she needs to consider speaking tok some people in private about matters rthat can be dealt with in private. otherwise she wasnt bad at all i learned alot and had a few laughs. Shes a DIVA in every respect of the word.", "She is strict but she will help you if you ask. She always has help material in her office if you are struggling with a topic. She is willing to do what she can to help her students. She tends to use other resources that are not required text but it is to benefit the students learning. She has high expectations both of her teaching and her student.", "Easy IF YOU PAY ATTENTION. She teaches based on application, not content. Expect things you don't know to be on the test. She grades easy but it is the tests that will get you. Make a study group - quizlet helps immensely with this class. Sweet lady but not the nicest of people, and will treat class as if it is an elementary school classroom.", "Great lady! doesnt return emails but the class it great. ive taken psych and child devlpmnt with her and she an amzing teacher. doesnt use the book at all but all the notes she gives in class are extremely critical come test time!", "She is a very sweet professor and knows her stuff. however, there is tremendous amount of work and hard to Ace.there is a quiz every week, which end up to be 17 quizzes for the whole semester. A 5 pages final paper, lots of term definition and 5 essays on the final. an extra credit assignment but it doesn't seem to improve your grade too much", "Ms. Mulcahy is a very good art/design teacher. She is willing to help and is very clear in what she expects from each assignment. Since this is a design/art course, you will be doing many different projects throughout the semester, so it is in your best interest that you go to class!", "She is so sweet and understanding!", "Dr. White is a fantastic instructor. She is very passionate about PR and gets the class involved so that you aren't falling asleep. She offers daily quizzes to check attendance and to help boost your grade! She is absolutely wonderful and someone I admire greatly.", "Smart women, but not a good teacher.", "Class lectures were interesting at times...she seems like a nice woman. Her tests can be kind of difficult and she is rather strict with the grading of assignments. Just make sure you go to every class and take notes during the lectures and you'll be fine for exams.", "She's a good professor but she uses so many long metaphors to explain things. Do not come to class for attendance and leave without letting her know first; I've seen her chase people out of class to get their names. Also, DON'T BUY THE BOOK; It's $90 and you will never, ever use it. Not once.", "Don't take her unless you are a math genies or lover. She barely knows what she's doing, she can't teach. She does the same example that's already on the book , when you ask for help she laugh and spend half of the class time making everybody guess the answer. She only does one example and then blame everything on the department. Tests are TOUGH .", "Professor Ho's lectures are convoluted and w/o structure. She gives nearly no opportunities for student involvement. That said, she is truly passionate about her work and her students and it shows in the lengthy and helpful feedback she gives on the four essays she assigns. The readings are amazing, it's just too bad we don't get to discuss them.", "This class is a complete waste of time; the entire class time is spent filling out worksheets with no explanation on how to actually teach the material to children. Her tests are mostly fill in the blank/short answer and are 100% information from the book that has nothing to do with what is gone over in class.", "No Comments", "Don't buy the book. Awesome teacher.", "College geometry is a self taught course. She literally doesn't teach anything. If you don't know what proofs are or have a good sense of geometry, this class is NOT FOR YOU!

She was an excellent instructor who was very organized and knew what she was talking about. Never having attended NIU before, Dr. L was very accommodating, especially when I had trouble paying off my NIU field camp fees and turning in my final essay for the class,", "She is one of the hardest graders ever. She makes fun of the journalism degree constantly and says that she's going to make us work \"twice as hard\" when we come to her class. Her assignments are ridiculous and she makes it very difficult to have a good grade in the class without staying up all night to finish her assignments.", "Dr. Waterhouse is a really nice lady who is willing to help you if you need it. Every English class can be sloe but she tries her best to keep your interest. She is not too hard of a grader and I would definitely recommend her for an English class!", "She is a great professor. Very kind hearted, lenient, and understanding. Her class was all in Spanish. The thing I appreciate more than anything is she grades by the level you're at in Spanish, not by letter grades per say. If you are not as advanced as others, she grades you at where you are. She is sooo helpful. Do the packets and the board work.", "She has a very strange sense of humor but I found her very funny. She's very kind and always willing to help. I would definitely take her for other classes if I could.", "Dr. Key's is a very good teacher, and really like what she does, which shows when she teaches. You will especially like her if you're a history major. Even if you don't like history she makes the subject fun to learn. Pretty fair on grading although the paper is worth quite a bit. She's great about making sure you're prepared for her tests.", "Blaaah.", "She was a great teacher! I took her in a mini over christmas break. She was good. I would suggest her to anyone!", "No Comments", "Prof. Dilek was awesome! She teaches botany in a way that is easy to learn, supplementing her lectures with videos and relevant HW assignments. She offers extra credit and puts some into each test too. Just study her study guides and you will be fine. Labs were fun and creative. Would take her for any class she offers!", "One of my favorite teachers of all time! Really helpful, really welcoming. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG!", "Just...dont.", "I have never met a Professor who is so rude and condescending to students. She would humiliate students in my class on a regular basis. Obviously thinks the world of herself...talks about herself constantly. Very harsh grading and gives TONS of very dry reading. I would never recommend a class with her.", "great teach", "I throughly enjoyed this class. Attendance is a must!! I learned alot from her.", "This lady is crazy! I took her for calc 3 expecting it to be not as bad and boy was I wrong! She makes no efforts to make sure her students succeed, hammers everyone on grading, and her tests are impossible. Not to mention the racist rant she went on in the middle of my class. She can explain it well but other than that she's awful. Stay away!", "She is a very open-minded professor. This class is an easy A. A few papers here and there, but she is always available to help! If you are unable to do something or maybe just having a diffucult time, she will work with you.", "The material for the class is hard, but Dr. Jackson is super helpful and knowledgeable. She does everything in her power to help you out. Would definitely recommend her!", "Professor Dameron is an excellent professor. If you do the work, you will succeed. Professor Dameron wants you to succeed. She is very fair. I took her online class and was quite please. Recommend her highly!!!!!!", "EXTREMELY hard class. Dr. Lorden is a very nice, funny, and hyperactive professor. Her attitude helps hold your attention as the material is very dry. The workload is quite ridiculous though.", "Awesome professor. She is super nice and very knowledgeable when it comes to technology. Class consists of a lot of busy work but nothing that is hard. She shows you lots of amazing free web-based resources that will be very helpful in the future classroom. Definitely recommend Professor Wall.", "Professor Hood LOVES her In-N-Out! Throughout the semester, she used burgers and donuts and used them to make philosophical arguments, which was pretty hilarious!! Though her lectures DRAGGED on and were most of the time boring, i still learned some interesting stuff when i read the book and wrote the essays. Do your best on the tests and papers!", "I didn't like her as a teacher. Her lectures were horrible and you could tell she had no interest in teaching anatomy... As a person though, she's hysterical. I loved her dry sense of humor", "Greatest teacher that I have had at OCAD! She takes the time to break down the text and explain everything possible in the little time that we have. I hope that she continues to teach, as a loss of her would mean disaster to the course itself.", "she's so intelligent, and also a really nice person. great prof.", "No Comments", "This is a great class a year later I still remember everything I learned I had a four hour one day class with her and did not hate going you should deffinatly take her for english.", "very well prepared to teach the course... goes out of her way to make sure students understand concepts. there is a lot of pier work and out of class work, but that is essential to mastering a language.", "She simply goes over the problems in the book. She doesn't even lecture!!!", "WORST PROFESSOR EVER! I have never had anything below an A in English and I have a D. I have never been so dissappointed in a professor in my life. She is terrible and she is very mean and often comes off as rude. She calls people out and she tears them apart. shes like a vicious DRAGON. she skipped class more than I did and were way behind.", "Extremely helpful professor if you are interested enough.

DO NOT take her class whatsoever!!! She looks like she is back from the dead!!!", "You must fit within her agenda.", "If you suck up, you'll do fine. Get on her good side. Listen to what she has to say and repeat it. Restate her thoughts in question form and you will get an A. Ask her about her childhood, marriage, and kids. Her birthday is Nov. 29. Remember that & throw her a party. This is how you will succeed in Gilpy's class.", "Just ask her about canoes", "she is a very nice, kind person. She speaks spanish clearly and is willing to help you if you ask. She is very interesting in class and shows enthusiasm! you'll do fine on tests if you study b/c they are not super hard.", "She makes you work but it is worth it. You will get the grade you deserve. everyone is treated fairly and equally.", "You have to play up to Greta if you want to get to teach 99. Then you have to take this course which the course was a waste of time.", "Kate teaches political science from a liberal point of view in one of the most conservative places on the planet. As such she gets a lot of resistance from her students. But if you go in with an open mind, you will emerge enlightened; this class really amped up my interest in politics. Warning: do the readings or you will incur her wrath!", "She's not a good teacher for the subject. The material is hard enough and strenous as it is, now add monotony to the lectures and outdated handounts. I know it's a hard subject, but if she wasn't so unbearably boring, maybe more people could stay and pass her class.", "Her Internal Audit class was an excellent elective that helped me better understand the materials in my other classes. The group project had some rough points, but she is a very lenient grader. She lets you take the IIA certification exam in lieu of the final, but I would recommend you just take the final. Her tests are not difficult at all.", "This is by far one the best Math professors at MDC. I wish she taught every math class from MAT0020 thru 1105 including Statistics and Calculus. I used to hate math but she made it so easy and clear to understand. Study and care about the class and you'll be fine. She's simply the best!!!!!", "Over the course of the semester this class has turned more into an art class than a psychology class. Sometimes I feel like she is talking down to us and is pretty set in her own way of doing things. I recomend this class for those of you who are more serious about art and enjoy service learning with children.", "The readings for this class are a bit confusing and really theoretical, but she does a pretty good job going over them in class. 3 papers: rough draft for each, which are for credit and her feedback is helpful. In class thinking papers are the hardest part as she grades them similar to a real paper. Organized class, handwriting hard to decipher.", "A brilliant professor. Make sure to show up to class and get yourself recognized. The more active you are in your own education, the more she is willing to help you along. If you put effort into your papers, you will be rewarded for it. highly recommended.", "Useless. Avoid at all cost. Had a great deal of interest in Finance before this class but she killed it with her unorganized lectures, hard marking and questions on exams outside the study material. Never again mate. Never.", "She went through whole lectures too fast because her concentrating group was who already studied in high school or worked in Accounting field. I prepared for the first class with reading the first chapter, but it was totally useless.. There were quite a lot of students(8-9) who already know everything and the professor taught them, not us.", "Professor Reid is a very nice lady. You do have to study, but it doesn't take too much effort. Her class was interesting and can help with day to day life. I enjoyed her class. She is funny.", "I love Mrs. Yancey. She is so funny! Class notes come in handy for the tests, but other than that her class is a lot of discussions. She is from Mississippi and makes fun of herself and her family a lot, which is refreshing. Take her if you can!", "Very hard class. She's organized, posts helpful class notes. Tests are hard. She finds a way to trick you. Assignments aren't that hard, but the TA's take off points for no reason and all those missed points really add up. Not many people get A's. Although she uses videos as examples alot, I find myself staring at the clock the whole time.", "No Comments", "Wish more teachers were like this one.", "I had prof. Gilson for a writer's workshop-style class.

If you are serious about your writing & want honest feedback in a creative setting prof. Gilson's class is ideal.", "No Comments", "NEVER TAKE HER CLASS!!! That is too much work, not much explanation/teaching. She absents a lot. You will not learn much.People skips her class a lot. The class start as 36+ people, now there are only around 15 left... It is a waste of time! Trust me.", "i never had a teacher like her. she is the best.", "She's really sweet, but you won't get your assignments back for months most of the time. There's no tests or anything, but several papers, projects, a 40 page written/artwork journal, and a final 10 page paper complete with an art project. She's incredibly forgetful and often assigns things at the last minute and provides minimal instructions.", "If you haven't taken Spanish before, then prepare to be behind on day one. Senora Zahajko moves quickly and doesn't pause for more than a minute to help anybody out. Daily homework is heavy and she is unsympathetic if you miss an assignment. Very biased to her favorite students and will easily single you out if you fall behind.", "Lot of writing, but I'm fine with that. Great textbook choice. Test match the coursework covered. The issue is if you don't regurgitate the views she shares (not the text or material) the way that she wants, your grade will suffer.", "Mrs. Mitchell is the best instructor at VSCC hands down. She really goes above & beyond to help anyone who needs it!!! Would highly recommend her if you want to have fun & learn at the same time!", "To do well on exams you have to know the concepts well. She does a good job of explaining in lecture and provides good examples. She's a very straightforward professor and the exams are fair.", "My first ever TA at university. She really goes hard on you, ESPECIALLY on safety, but it's because this is your first chemistry lab and if you don't get it down now, you'll get hurt later on and she does not want that AT ALL. Nice sometimes... sometimes not, really hit or miss. Switch if you can. Future labs will be better if you continue chem", "I loved this class. She is my favorite teacher ever. I am taking her next semester as well. She is always open for help and gives us more time if we need it. She is a little silly but that is what keeps us laughing. It is my favorite class to go to! :)", "ART 101 is Drawing 1. I learned a lot in this class, but it's not a class you can joke about. She is very serious with work because it is a studio class. Students have to be hardworking and show improvement for her to be happy, which is sensible. I do recommend her as a Drawing teacher.", "An awesome teacher who depends on her students too much. If the students don't feel like talking the class will drag on. Very sweet and easy to get along with but the class will drag if you do not participate. Lots of readings, but papers are clear and not too hard.", "This was such a great class. I learned a lot and it was really easy to pass as long as you showed up and you did the work. She doesn't ask a lot of students. There is a 15-20 page paper so beware of that if you decide to take her class.", "laid back, easy-going, and she definitley knows her stuff ... just wish she knew how to teach and give lectures", "She picks great material for you to read and her lectures make you love it more. I read a lot more these days thanks to her.", "She is easy if she likes you and you WILL know if she likes you. BE OUTGOING and FUNNY and you'll do well. She really gives like, 110% if you are funny and bring props out of your ass. If she doesn't like you, you will get C's... Its that simple.", "If you're looking to take Hall for Sounding Numbers... AVOID THIS CLASS. Yes, it's easy but I've learned absolutely nothing. Longest lectures ever and they make no sense. She gives quizzes every Thursday. I personally hated this class because I had no interest in taking a music class. You HAVE to read her notes and she gives a crap ton of homework.", "The best professor in the whole college ! Cares for your project and grade like it's her own. More than a teacher she is a mentor.", "if you want to hate yourself for an entire semester then i highly recommend her class.", "Do not take her any way", "Such a sweetheart!!!!! Some of her assignments were a little tedious, but overall I loved this course!

Dr Chirico is great!", "Awesome prof!:-) She is very enthusiastic about the topic, extremely knowledgeable, and her class made me much more interested in the subject. She makes a real effort to make assignments interesting and non-repetitive. She is also super approachable and willing to help students out.

Which makes it easier to keep the knowledge your hearing", "Grades with check, check plus, etc. like you're in kindergarten. Very tough at grading. Too many readings. The tests/quizzes are timed and you are expected to write 5 full essays during the midterm/final. Talks too quickly. Attendance is mandatory. Quizzes at beginning and end of class. Horrible. Don't know how I passed.", "I really liked Tosha. She was a really great teacher and I learned a lot about literacy and children.", "Good Teacher. Make sure you go to class because the problems she reviews in class are the same on the exams and she DOES NOT RECORD HER LECTURES.

Exams are all Multiple Choice, some true or false.", "I can't belive she dosnt have a chili peper. she deserves 2.

I got an A and learned so much and it was my favorite class.", "shes horrible I would never take her again", "Dr. Davis is nice enough, but she is unbelievably hard. Was pretty interested in Political Science prior to taking her class, but now, will never take another one. Really tough papers with very vague prompts.

I wasn't even sure I was going to like theatre but she deffinately changed my mind.

Her class discussions were pretty depressing, and it was sometimes hard to know what she wanted in an assignment, but overall it was an enjoyable class.", "She did not explain her assignments very well and when did not clarify when we needed to turn things in. She was extremely disorganized as well. The class was easy but all we did was listen to her read notes outloud that we could print off the internet. The class time was used very poorly", "Had her for Topics in Lit III: Holocaust Lit. She handled this topic with humility, understanding, and professionalism, even appropriate humor. Engages her students. A rare and exceptional caliper of teacher. Recently won a well-deserved award for her teaching. On sabatical now but will be back soon. An exceptional classroom experience! Yes!", "She tries her hardest to get every student an A. She gives bonus points. We had a 25% curve one time. There are only 4 test including the final. If you read the book, take notes in class, and go to her office hours, you'll get a HIGH \"A.\" And I mean like 97% or 98%. She is always asking if we understand things and stops for questions every 5seconds", "No Comments", "Prof. Neves taught this class in the summer. The daily 4-hour format led to a challenging class with a huge amount of reading, but the class was wonderfully stimulating. Prof. Neves's in-class discussion format causes students to think.

She's tough but fair and does not cater to slackers or those who think they are special snowflakes. She ALWAYS helps those who work hard and have the guts to ask.", "Horrible. English is my favorite subject, and I hated this class with a passion. She will tell you not to do something in your paper, then take points off becuase of it. A lot of the class failed. Try not to take her if you can help it", "If you want an easy A.. take this teacher! She isn't a very good teacher, but the material is pretty easy that you can learn it yourself. Homework is extra credit. Just take her.", "This is one of the worst classes I took at the U of A. The teacher is really biased in teaching, she talks a lot about her opinion not anything interesting or useful. Try to get a better TRAD. You need to goto class, take notes everyday, 3 writting 2-3 pages, and 3 test and a final. Test are 50% easy questions but the other 50% are hard.", "She's just a poor teacher, no social etiquette and made me dislike my favorite subject......", "I took a 4 week calc 2 course and was sure I was going to fail. She is one of the most helpful teachers I've ever had. She gives you every opportunity she can to pass the class. I made a 40-something on the final an I still made a 75 in the class!!! If you take her just make sure you do your online quizes.", "I dropped this class because I was failing. I couldn't understand her writing so I was copying out of the book. She pointed out to everyone in class that I was not paying attention. I received an F from her even though I dropped!!!!", "TOO many essays and work (we have other classes you know), very stubborn and disagreeable. It's ESL, why so difficult? Class is easy for me, because I was \"accidently\" placed there.", "The best professor I've ever had. Even as an alum i want to go back and learn more from her. There isn't a professor at Denison as in-the-know or as active in their field as Amanda. Just fantastic.", "Dr. Estrada is awesome. I had her for 2 semesters. Her class isn't too hard, but you learn a lot of Spanish. She makes you participate, which helps you learn really well. Her test aren't too bad either. Just study up before them.", "easy as it gets for literature, never bought one book for both classes and cut class all the time and still got B's. imposible to stay in her class with dying of boardum. if you need an easy class..a must take", "Professor Dogru is a great professor. She is foreign so she has a very slight accent and occasionally she will accidentally mess up some grammar while talking but she is extremely helpful and truly cares about her students", "She is a wonderful teacher. Very easy to talk to and ask for her help. Always smileying in class.", "Intro to American Studies isa very easy class. Only requires readings each week for a quiz and one paper. Very easy!", "You have to work really hard in order to be successful in this class. By the way, she gives many paragraphs and stories to read each class. After that, you have to provide a response of the story. There are many paper that has been given each class, so you have to be really responsible of keep track of all of your stuff and work.", "She's pretty though. I think she expects a lot, but you will learn in her class. Her tests are pretty easy all you have to do is pay attention to class discussions and you'll do well on the tests.", "This class is really hard if you let it be. You just have to pay attention in class, do all the homework and class activities, get C's on the tests and you will do fine. Dr. Chen is a cool lady and really relaxed. She teaches really boring classes but does her best to help you learn the material.", "Dr. Carnes was scary at first but I grew to like the class. Until the day she started kicking people out of the classroom. I missed one day and she got extremely upset. You definitely have to attend every single day, and be prepared to take grammar quizzes everyday as well. Not a piece of cake class that it should be.", "The class started out good, but then she seemed to totally get off track. I have no idea what she taught us in the second half of the semester. However, extremely lenient grader.", "Very lenient", "I thought Dr. Carnes' class was okay, although I would not take her again. The assignments appear easy at first, but then you're surprised when you get a bad grade. NO FEEDBACK whatsoever given - no comments on papers or grades given/posted on Blackboard. Plays favorites and expects attendance EVERY class. Absolutely no slack given!!", "No Comments", "PROF MOORE WAS THE BEST MATH TEACHER IVE EVER HAD. IM NOT GOOD AT MATH AT ALL AND SHE ACTUALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE MATERIAL. I RECOMMEND HER. SHES SO PASSIONATE ABOUT HER JOB.", "This is the most unorganized teacher i ever had. English is my favorite subject, i have never struggled with writing before until this class. She knows her facts, but has NO idea how to teach. She is not helpful and SOOOO hard to understand. The whole class is way behind and we do not even go by the sylabuss. She does not stay on track with anythin", "She's an interesting professor. Really nice, maybe a little strange at times, but super down to earth. I like the type of work that we do. It's an interesting class, a lot of work with personal life stuff, but you don't necessarily need to share. Lots of creative writing stuff and you keep a dream journal. A few small projects too", "No Comments", "An intelligent professor with *high standards* who will offer help if you ask. I was frustrated by her class discussion approach at times, but I think it benefited more students, overall.", "good teacher", "This was a grad course on how to teach psych to undergrads. I learned so much about what NOT to do. She was disorganized, distracted, & very unclear. She wasn't able to finish grading on time due to dealing with administrative issues so she decided it would be okay to give the ENTIRE class \"Incompletes.\" 2 weeks later & still no grades. Seriously?", "Ann Lewald is a great teacher and friend. She has always made time to assist her students when ever they needed help. I can only say I wish that they were more teachers at Tech like her. God Bless You!", "ASA 1 is the best class I've taken so far. Prof. Ho is very passionate in her teaching, and I suggest you participate, ask questions, answer questions, sit near the front to be engaged in the course as she can go on tangents. This course will fulfill a lot of GE, but you got to work for it! A lot of reading and 2 Papers, Discussion worth a lot.", "Dr. Farrer is the BEST professor at Cal. I highly recommend taking any course you can with her. She is very thorough and clear with what she expects. Excellent experience.", "Her class is a lot of fun. Work hard and you will get a good grade.", "She marks FAIRLY, and her classes are interesting. Good Prof.", "You must attend class otherwise you will not pass the class. Pay attention in class because some questions on the test come straight from class. Her tests are quite hard and she doesn't really tell you what is going to be on the tests. Other than the tests, the class isn't very hard, its mostly being in class and you get the points.", "Very nice and extremely helpful but the most boring class I've ever taken! tests and essays are pretty easy. just so sick of the pics. Ready for class to be over", "I had her for ASL 1 and 2. I wish I could have her for my teacher for every class. She always gives good feedback. She also tells stories along with vocab to make it easy to learn. She also taught us how to still use signs even if we do not know the exact sign by description. Best teacher I have ever had from kindergarten to now. She really cares.", "My gosh, is she awful! Hates men, it seems, and is tremendously unfair in her grading. Wrecked my GPA over a technicality. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!", "OMG...This teacher is a hard grader. She will take off if simple math, that you can do in your head, is not written down properly. She overexplains material to the point where it's just confusing. Oh yea and don't forget to leave your cell phone in class before you use the restroom or Pop Quiz!", "She was not a helpful professor. She always had to derive an equation and prove it. Her method of grading was awful. At the end of the course she had to drop 8 of the lowest homework grades because the entire class was doing so poorly.", "Great stuff. She really knows her stuff and conveys it enthusiastically and compellingly. Not the easiest of graders, but fair ... easy on the eyes too!", "she missed half of the semester and expected us to continue on like nothing happened. no one, not even our subs knew what was going on and when you ask questions she tells you to \"check blackboard\" even if the question you cant be answered over the computer, its probably because she cant explain it to you. her blackboard is soooooooooo unorganized.", "Good teacher. Always there to help. Easy A. Only 3 tests that are 35 questions each.", "shesaniceteacher.sheiscertainlyveryknowledgebleabout thehistoryofearlychildhoodandcareshepracticallyhas all her material memorized, at times she speaks a little fast,and sometimes i found her language to be incoherent just because she tends to use a lot of sophisticated vocabulary both when shelectures, andalso onherxams.studyhardforherexams,", "average", "Dr. Carmean is a great professor and I'm excited to take another class with her! 1 worksheet on a 50-or-so minute film and a quiz over the book every week. No actual textbook, but you do have to read two books. Show up to class! Take it seriously! You will be better off for it!", "If you ask questions, she acts as if you are stupid and expects you to know the answer. She's rude. She may need to stick with regular English 101 and not ENG 257.", "No Comments", "Dr. Slusher is one of the rudest professors I have ever had. She is the exact reason why I am changing my major this semester. She grades the semester paper extremely difficult. She treats her students like they do not matter. The exams are rough. She will tell you something will be on the exam, and it wont be.", "Ok i dont know if i should write something, but i sat in her class just for the first day and DROPPED IT!! She presented the class as if we were in elementary school and frightened me. the work load appeared to be too hard for a 100 level class and so i just wanted to warn people before they jumped head first into that classroom. good luck!", "Any class with Mrs. Schoenly is valuable as long as you dig into things with her and believe in her. Those who choose to \"just show up\" will never get anything out of her classes. End of the semester projects are extremely valuable!", "Great prof. Very personable teaching style and a knack for breaking down complex ideas. Expectations were clear and she was very approachable for clarifications. Also great at answering questions.", "Knowledgeable professor. The material lends itself to dryness, because much of it is a repeat of material studied in several other MCC classes. Not a demanding course if you stay on top of the materials and screenings. I enjoyed the class, her structuring of the class and her dry wit.", "She was an amazing teacher really funny and nice. Extremely helpful, fantastic class I loved it! Used the book for terms and just when we had to compare paintings. Midterm and final easy of you study for it, recommend flashcards.", "Dr. Deguchi is really sweet, and she's an amazing musician. She's an okay professor, her grading is fair, and her accent is amusing. But the textbook will be your greatest friend, she bases her teaching solely on the book at times...", "Great teacher. Great person.", "The class is about Excel,Word,PowerP,&Access. She goes through all, if you know much about functions and querying in these program you will do just fine. She teaches you the basics and then goes very in depth so pay attention. Everything comes from the book so don't hesitate to get ahead of the game. Grading is amazing hundreds of points & likeable", "evil woman, only gives you an A if you pretend you agree with her feminist/biblical agenda", "Very sour and rude. She doesn't seem like she likes her job or the students very much. She gets easily frustrated, and seems to have a hard time explaining things in a way that other people can understand. It's like it's her way or the highway...", "Internet course- never saw test grades, portfolio or observ. journal grades posted in Eagle. Very vague syllabus and poor instructions for largest point assignments and offered little to no help in clarifying it. Very frustrated at the slowness (or lack of) answers to questions sent via email. Not recommended for an internet course.", "No Comments", "I'm in grad school and looking back at all the prof's I've had over the years, she sands out as being horrible more than anyone. Should've been fired back in 2002!!!!!!", "I love her!!! We get along great she is a wonderful teacher!!!!", "No Comments", "Her love of the subject matter every once in a while is overwhelming, but far more often it rubs off on you.", "Thought you would do good because you aced composition 1 and have had mostly a's and a b here and there throughout the semesters? Think again. Takes off lots of points for small errors and so far has assigned topics that I find very vague and hard to write about. Crossing my fingers that I can just pass and not lose my scholarship...", "Deb is a great teacher. She clearly explains the material and lets you know right where you stand. I highly recommend this teacher.", "The class was almost entirely based on class discussion. We did outside work but it was rarely discussed in class. Looking back, my Spanish conversation and listening skills improved, but my writing skills stayed pretty much constant. Good teacher and not too demanding.", "Easy class, she is confusing at times, but the material is fairly easy so I wouldn't worry to much on that. She tries to help where she can...though her phone and internet frequently goes out. Offers study guides, and homework is extra credit.", "Extremely helpful and will go out of her way to help you understand the concepts. Offered extra credit opportunities with the first 3 tests and replaced lowest test grade with the final (if final is higher). As long as you put forth effort you should do great in her class.", "She is the Best Proffesor, a little tough, but is okay. You have to listen tand do the assignments;if u do so you are fine. She is an effective proffesor with a lot of knowledge and experience. If you take hr she will help you to get involved in exciting issues.", "Jasken is, by far, one of my favorite professors at McDaniel. She's is a great teacher, is fun, engaging, and understanding. I never felt that class was a waste of time and the class material was relevant and applicable. I would highly recommend taking a class with her--especially the Editing and Desktop Publishing class!", "She is a pretty good teacher but the harder you work on an essay the lower your score. I half-assed my last two essays and got A's while working hard on my first one and got a B. She an easy grader for the most part and this is her last semester.", "Class was easy and always interesting. You can revise your papers as many times as you need to get an A. Really cares about the students and what is going on in their lives. no tests, no final. most of the assignments can be used for honors graduation requirements. awesome teacher!", "communication is not her forte...so don't be surprised if when you get your comment sheet back after the semester is over that she mentiona things that are completely new to you", "Tests are hard and every single point counts. Only 34 point different in an A and a B. I was 4 points from an A and she would not pump me up ... and I was at every single class. Strict, but I would take her again. Just follow her review and study hard!", "One of my favorite classes at Loyola. She is the sweetest professor and she really cares about you. She is always there for you if you need help in her class. This class is not the easiest, but it is do-able and go to office hours. do all the homework and you will do good on the test. Preparing for the class is how you will get an A in this class.", "I was in Dr. Hall's class for two semesters of Excursions. Got into a lot of subject matter you wouldn't classify as \"math.\" Wouldn't call it easy, but wouldn't call it hard either. Although there's usually one hard test per semester. But the quizzes every Friday can pull up your grade.", "She is very helpful; all you have to do is just talk to her. She is very understanding, but try not to miss her class", "I had her for 3010 and guess what guys? peace o cake! alot of these reviews seem baseless, 6 essays 2 tests thats all! are you kidin me!? yea we had to read a book, but it wasnt that bad. Disregard (is that spelled wrong?) the other ratings, she is good", "Lecture slides(riddled with spelling/grammar errors) and YouTube channels are 80% of the material covered in class. Unless the students are engaged she tends to move quickly/clumsily. Clearly knowledgeable in the subject but not the clearest on answering questions and a little hostile in answering questions even though she encourages them.", "As this professor was the only professor teaching the course, I had no option but to take her class. She seems to mean well and I'm sure she is well respected in the Nursing world, but it was impossible to meet with her one on one and she failed to email me back a few times. Be prepared to study and pay attention in class or you will not pass.", "Excellent professor, passionate about her subject.", "Dr. Waterhouse was my advisor, and a prof. She is the most influential prof I had at Cal U and she helped me tremendously with my writing.", "She teaches really good, her exams were based off everything she teaches. I did not understand math and she made it so simple. My only issue is class attendance. I missed class once and was not able to make up her work even though I had an injury. Five points from an \"A\". SKIP CLASS YOU WON'T PASS. Also beware of group work.", "Debra is a good teacher She is going to help you if you are putting efforts never miss her any class because she always teach something interesting and important", "Possibly the scariest 80 lb. person on the planet, but an excellent teacher. She knows everything about everything and is very fond of her overhead projector. Just attend the classes, make notes, study and don't worry that she doesn't seem to like you, it's nothing personal, she doesn't like anyone. You'll survive.", "She's a very nice lady and she's a great teacher.", "This class is completely subjective and she teaches it very unfairly. She let half the class have cameras for a week longer than the rest of our class and still considers it to be a \"fair\" assignment. She told us to pretend it was like \"Survivor\", sorry but I don't remember signing up for a tv show at registration...", "Kristine really knows what she is talking about in Communication Studies. She does a good job at giving a brief overview of all the basic important topics in Comm. Studies, but also does a good job of making sure people understand them. Tests aren't very hard and if you are able to take the honors section, that's the best way to go!", "The worst teacher ever. Drop the class, lost my money the worst experience at miami dade.", "Trust me on this: DO NOT take this woman for this class. Without a doubt the worst experience of my academic career. You've been warned.", "Easy \"A\" my favorite class at Miami Dade. She's has a lot of rules and strict on attendance but besides that she cares about her student, good at her profession, and gives snacks. I can guarantee you, you will love and enjoy this class.....", "She is boring and not very clear, she speaks very quietly so sit near the front of the class.", "Awesome teacher!!! She introduced me to sign lang and now I want to interpret ;). She really cares for her students and supports them 100%. She also makes sure your grasp the importance of facial expressions. Though the class in normally later in the day-you will enjoy attending this class!", "Really good professor-- science isn't my best subject, but I did pretty well in this class. She understands that many of her students aren't bio majors, and teaches the material in a way that's easy to understand. There are 4 tests and a final exam-- mostly multiple choice with 1 or 2 essays questions. I definitely recommend her.", "She is an awesome teacher. She's very easy. You have to write a couple of essays. Half of the class if going to be watching movies and your final project is going to be an essay on a meaningful song. She is a great teacher, Awesome!", "She is a good helper when you ask her any questions. She spend a lot of time explaining any math problems that you do not understand (if you come to her office). She requires a lot of work from you. Overall, she's great.", "this was one of the worst teacher i've had. we get off topic alot and if you don't agree with what she says. she shows animosity towards you.You can never make an A on any of her assignments and forgets everything that she says in the previous class.Laugh at all of her stale jokes unless you'll end up failing her class because shes just vindictive", "The material we learn is definitely not hard. She is a nice and some what a humorous teacher. She has helpful methods There are a few things I would say. She is very picky on how she wants the homework done (it is graded based on correct answers), you are not allowed a calculator, and she kinda gets frustrated when you interrupt to ask a question.", "AWSOME professor. So much fun and HILLARIOUS personality.", "She is one of my favorite professors. She is easy going, amusing, super nice and her classes are not very hard. If you show up and listen to the lecture you will pass this class. She gives study guides and spends a day reviewing before the tests. She shows videos sometimes and allows for some class time to work on the one project she assigns.", "Took ACC 202 online and was skeptical at first because of the other reviews. She's a great professor and emails right away if you have questions. Read the book, do the practice questions, and double check your calculations, it helps. I got an A on all the exams, but you have to really think outside the box on some questions and manage your time.", "I enjoyed the class and the professor is very nice. Class meets only once a week and she assigns only three essays.", "She doesn't really \"teach\" us. She \"shows\" us things. She doesn't explain how to use them in certain situations which makes her a poor professor. And she takes great joy in making the tests abnormally difficult.", "No Comments", "You have to get on the good side of Margo. If she likes you, she will basically give you a good grade..if she doesn't like you, you will probably get a bad grade no matter what. Most theatre classes are basically about coming to class and participating- so that is what she will expect of you.", "Lindahl was a great professor to have for this class. You are required to go to 2 concerts for the class throughout the semester, but less than other mus114 professors. If you keep up on the online quizzes (you can always get 100%) and do the extra credit youll be totally fine. She really wanted her students to succeed and is very helpful!", "Nancy is awesome! She knows everything about children and will help you.", "Overall good class that will prepare you for a career in accounting. Group project can be pretty burdensome (especially if you don't get placed into a good group) so be prepared to spend a lot of time on it. ACL assignments are difficult and time consuming and worth very little of the overall grade. Take it only if you are serious about accounting.", "Every week essays, every week essays. what the heck is that. I am tired of writing her essays. I almost wrote a thick book because of her. Oh my god I can't explain my feelings.", "Is a good teacher but when it comes to speechs she is a tough grader. Everything has to be perfect for you to get an A. If you are looking for an easy A don't take this professor", "pretty easy class, some busy work, but not alot. just go to class and do what they tell ya and you'll be fine", "Nice person but perhaps on a different intellectual level at times. Lectures can be hard to understand. She will always help you if you ask and not too hard on due dates. Can grade hard at times.", "I found this professor really inspiring. Poetry is a difficult subject and she handled it beautifully.", "Julia is amazing - brilliant, a great teacher and beautiful! How DOES she do it all?", "No Comments", "Not a good program at all too much busy work", "She is really self-centered. Doesn't care about her students at all and talks negitively about them in class. She gives bad grades to people who do the work and work hard and others who don't care about the class she gives them excellent grades. DON'T TAKE HER. YOU'LL BE MAKING THE BIGGEST MISTAKE.", "It was an absolute joy...which is certainly helpful when the class is on Saturday morning at 11am. We used the book a few times, but we mostly watched videos and talked about lovemaking and lust. Midterm prod. project was fun. You will have to see 3 plays...2 school prods and a prof. production. Lots of fun, though!", "Horrible. She's mundane and teaches by reading directly off her powerpoints. Not to mention you can't understand her powerpoints. Does not care if students are interested in material, and does not try to make it interesting. Would not recommend!!!", "A giant critic. Teaches the class as if she is constantly getting high on her powers to critique and judge, rather than teaching the students to learn, she teaches the students to memorize and judges based on how well the instructions are memorized. May be describe as cool, but as far as a teacher goes, i wouldn't recommend.", "If you want to take a photo class, Kathy is the one to take it with!! She was so much fun. I learned so so much from her class. She makes everything easy to understand. And she is very creative.", "Not very helpful to students at all. Questions in the study guide do not help and you spend so much time trying to memorize what you have read for the tests, that you don't have much time to learn other things.", "She's Awesome", "Easy, easy easy. Very interesting lecturer and tests are cake. I mean really, she gives you 8-10 long answer questions to choose from, and you pick two. What more do you want??", "She feels strongly about research and her opinion behind the research. No point in arguing with her, just take in the information she shares. If you read the book in depth, the test won't be hard. The only reason she'll quizzes is if too many students are late. She gave spontaneous homework, nothing strenuous.", "To be fair, I am rating Blanck on her Interdisciplinary Research and Writing class which is a co-taught class. You will get three professors, each for 4 weeks, focusing on a different subject. The class is awful. There is so much work with little communication between the 3 professors. Unfortunately it is mandatory for American Studies majors. GL!", "all i have to say is \"eh.\" Take a class with her if you like the topic or need the credit. She's not too bad, not too good.", "Professor is very nice and is willing to help BUT: I done decent in the class. Grades weren't great - but certainly not the worst. I failed the final so she failed me for the entire semester. I have to take it again. There is nothing fair about this!", "BEST PROFESSOR EVER! She definitely expects you to work for your grade. Do the readings, do the homework, go to labs and class. Basically, be a responsible adult like you're supposed to be at this age. That's all there is to it. Go to her office hours. She will go above and beyond to help if you show the initiative. A+++++!!!", "Do NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT take this woman's class. Never in my adolescent life have I stressed so much about any academic subject but this course is absolutely abysmal. The teacher tries to be funny but often comes off as very condescending. There is very little passion in the class which makes it that much harder to sit through.", "shes super nice and her class is easy. i definitely recommend her.", "She is terrible. Just the worst teacher ever. I have had a few mediocre teachers in my life but I have never actually had a BAD teacher and she was just awful. She does not know the material she was teaching and one of the students basically taught our class because Dr. V got so much wrong. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!", "Dr. Long is the best English teacher I have ever had! I look forward to taking more of her classes. There is a lot of work involved with the course, however, if you show an effort and work hard, there is no reason you shouldn't get a good grade! Highly recommended for anyone who is serious about working hard and enjoying their English class.", "Took this class as a hybrid, then needed to drop the class a few weeks in due to some schedule changes. She is a great professor, generates good discussion, interesting, and fun. However, as far as a 2010 course goes there is a LOT of writing: Way more than other professors for 2010 Several page papers due almost every week along with assignments.", "She was one of my favorite professors (even surprised our class with pizza!). She is so sweet, caring, and enthusiastic to teach. She is very helpful when you ask questions. The class isn't extremely difficult but not easy. Her tests are a little tough, but if you study and do all of the homework you'll be fine.", "Linda is very disorganized & hard to follow. Her teaching methods leave much to be desired. She won't help students she dislikes. She openly harasses students of certain minority ethnicities, and does whatever she can to thin their ranks and keep their achievement low. Tread carefully. She nearly turned my educational experience into a nightmare.", "I withdrew from her class. She is super tough and the class average can be between the C and D range at times. A lot of writing is expected in and out of class and is super strict about grammar and MLA format, one mistake and you are done. The class went down to about 8 students from being full when I withdrew. She \"tries\" to be funny.", "I'm really glad to have taken Spanish with Estrada. She gives too many handouts, but she's great! And she's pretty funny.", "No tests are given, all you have to do is write the papers. She truly cares about her students and learns each students name. Works with you on anything you need help with. Makes class go by fast.", "People say she is biased towards Palestinians, but are you kidding me? Thank goodness, cause I don't see a lot of folks pulling for Palestine in the U.S.\r In other regards she's a valient professor who keeps and open mind towards other views.", "Ms. Serra is not the easiest teacher I have ever had, but she is obviously motivated to help every student pass the class and learn to be a more confident speaker. The other raters said she is very forgiving with absences, but I do know people who were dropped for being absent too much. After all, it's a speech class and you have to be there.", "She was a very very nice person and extremely helpful. Class was never the full time period and she gave a good amount of time for all assignments. Four papers and class work is graded. It is important to go to class. I would take her again!", "Ms. Dameron is very clear with what is expected and how she grades. She emails how-to videos regularly, provides good notes and worksheets, and offers online students to come to campus to study with that class for tests. She wants you to learn and pass. She's the best teacher I've had at TCC.", "Emily is one of the most energetic and outgoing professors I ever had, there never was a day I didn't want to not come to class I loved every minute of it, she truly is a blessing and a gifted teacher", "The class was interesting. Learned a lot about different QC faculty research interests which helped me discover my own research pursuits. She is extremely accessible by email or by meeting before or after class. A research topic that interests you is chosen and a 15 pg paper and presentation is based on that. A great intro to the world of research.", "She bases the grade on whether she likes u or not. Her tests are VERY tricky! Shes not approachable,& makes students feel stupid. She makes her grad students grade her tests, so double check ur grade! The average grade she gives is a C, So dont expect and A. She gives back all ur tests @ the end so u go an entire semester not knowing where u stand", "She is very unprofessional and admits that she is biased. I have ALWAYS Aced speeches, I competed across the state on the speech team in high school and won multiple speech contests and scholarships... and got a B- in her class. You do the math. If you have to take her, focus more on winning her over than your speeches and you'll do well.", "This woman is brain-dead. She gives no help and has admitted she doesnt know what she is teaching. If you tell her she is wrong and prove it she doesnt care. constanly late. blames you if she lost you work or if you have equip problems. MUST BE FIRED!", "She's a tough teacher but if you do the work you are fine. Don't take her if you get bored during lectures because hers tend to drag on.", "she's horrible, annoying to listen to, and picks favorites, it's VERY hard to get a good mark in her tests, even if u have asked her for help and she does, you'll still do bad...NOT recommended", "Enjoyable classes", "She is very nice, and likable as a person but her teaching style is very difficult to follow along & speaks very fast. With us she has to go by the departmental syllabus. She only shows us a few problems & its hard to ask questions. Tests have nothing to do with class work or MyMathLab. Also i think the Mastery worksheets are given too much.", "she is awsome! you shouldn't go wrong with this teacher.", "Awesome teacher! She's also my accompanist and she's just wonderful!", "Doctor Lorden was one of the most caring teachers I have ever had. She made you work for it but she knew how to get you to really learn the material. And while it was a tough class, I can actually say I walked out knowing a lot of new things. She did allow test retakes. I miss her and if you had the blessing of being her student, you were lucky.", "I really liked Kaci. She taught pretty well and I felt like I got a good grasp of the subject. I really thought she was hot so maybe that had something to do with it. I could not take my attention off her.", "This class was extremely easy. If you do the work this class should be an automatic A. In addition, Dr. Todd is great about letting you know about scholarships and other opportunities. Definitely stay on her good side.", "Amazing teacher. I loved her ! Go to your classes, spend some time reading over her past finals, and it's an A+ guaranteed.", "Super nice lady, willing to help you out. The course itself is alright. Some of it (the thoery part early on, particularly) is quite boring but I thought she did a pretty good job of mixing things up in terms of assigned readings and videos.", "She's an okay prof. She's somehow simultaneously very reasonable and hopelessly out of touch with students. She'll push back a deadline, but then not be clear what she wants from the assignment. She'll help if you ask for it, but is also harder than other 150 profs in that she assigns more work.", "Sensei is so awesome! I look forward to this class so much. Like I wanted spring break to end so I could come back to class. It's a very interactive class, and you definitely learn a lot. just make sure you COME TO CLASS and do ALL the homework.", "No Comments", "You have to know 300-400 art pieces for both the midterm and the final. As a result you won't remember much from the course, but she does give alot of extra credit and she seems to want people to enjoy the course. Her Spanish Art one course was the best because you really get to look at art from a monarch's perspective. It is easy to dote on her.", "She is very opinionated, and if you disagree with her you become her enemy. She can be rude and disrespectful in a sneaky way that doesn't bring everyone's attention to it, only to the person whom she is attacking. I received an \"A\" in the class, but I wouldn't take another class taught by her. She seems to have issues with foreigners.", "Although I'm not receiving a bad grade at the moment, I cannot deny that she is not the greatest of teachers. She skips over some things in class and her assignments occasionally will cover things she did not discuss. Make sure you go over her review guides and do the reading and the homework, otherwise you'll probably fail. Go to the tutors 1st.", "She made it difficult to ask questions. She made me feel like I was an idiot by not understanding. She seems veryyyyyy intimidating.", "No Comments", "the class has made me miserable. it has been my worst experience at eku. she needs to do something about her mood swings and i am sick of watching her drool over her picks.", "I'm a conservative grassroots activist and I expected the worst walking into a Condit class. (There are rumors.) Her class challenged me intellectually more than any other class I've had at VCU. Were this a sword battle, I would bow and compliment her on a well-fought engagement. Take Condit, especially if you're conservative.", "Don't waste your time going to class, all lectures are posted. Very boring and unclear!!!", "SHE WILL KEEP YOU BUSY BUT IT HELP YOU ON THE TEST!!!", "I enjoy Chef Anne, she is my favorite teacher her at el Centro, and I can tell she loves her students as well as baking, She is an amazing woman, and is willing to experiment new receipts with her students.", "TERRIBLE boring class. She's sort of pissy, and not cool...", "Great teacher. She is patient and laid back. I took her for Total Body Conditioning. She is sweet and teaches well.", "God, she's the best professor in the world. She;s very down to earth, do the work and you'll pass easily. If I was stuck on another planet, I'd pick her to go with me. She is nothing like other professors and she speaks her mind!", "BvB is one of the best professors at GW. She has a love for Renaissance art, which is infectious. Her lectures are fascinating and clear, and she is a pretty easy grader. She really cares about her students, so it pays to get to know her. I have taken many classes with her and hope to take more. She is everything a student could ask for.", "don't bother with the book, you won't use it. everything you need to know is given in lecture and written on the board. Very easy class, IF you take notes! easy to talk to, answers questions, willing to help you.", "The best teacher the program has to offer. Yes she was tough, but she's the ONLY professor who genuinely wants you to understand what it takes to be a nurse. The rest could care less if you get it or not.", "I learned so much in this class, at first it was overwhelmingly, but she gives you linked learning to videos and her lecture notes with examples. I found it fascinating that I not only understood about the developing child and adolescence, but about myself. I loved the inspirational messages and reminders that she included in her announcements.", "No Comments", "Ms. Baylard makes learning English enjoyable. If you're wondering what English professor to take, Baylard is the best.", "I thought Dr. Sydlik was very helpful. I had her in her first semester, and I liked her very much, she was very clear and concise. As far as treating her students like 12 year olds goes, if you are inconsiderate, she's going to let you know about it.", "Excellent teacher", "Really wonderful professor. The class projects do require a lot of time; however, as long as you pace yourself you should be fine. Class agrees to advise against taking 3040 & 3070 together because they both have time consuming projects. No textbook. Attendance req'd. You use Macs. Grade is dependent upon projects for most part.", "Took this class online. Very straight forward. At the end of each week four chapter tests were due along with four separate responses to each chapter. She allowed for the test to be taken twice keeping the highest of the two grades. The final exam could only be taken once. Commit to reading the book. She has no problem answering questions.", "Great professor. Knows her stuff - has open office hours. Very nice - brings in candy and stuff. Definitely recommended!", "Best teacher at Saint Rose yet. Tosha really knows her stuff and teaches it the way that we should teach it to young children. Very hands on and so caring! Highly reccommended!", "GIVES QUIZZES EVERY CLASS AND PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE SMALL DETAILS IN THE BOOKS.", "Shes honestly the worst teacher Ive ever had. She grades poorly, shes rude, if you dont do something its basically the end of the world for her. Im currently in the class and shes nothing but rude and disrespectful to each student. Just sat outside the classroom with a few students and we all agreed shes the worst teacher here", "prof m worked with me in 1982 and i enjoyed her approach to the above noted class.", "Thinks she is the queen and we should all bow to her. I think she needs to retire or get a personality", "Professor Comay focuses on Nietszche, Freud and Marx ONLY and you can't understand anything she says. Her tangents make it very difficult to pay attention. Lectures are brutal and not falling asleep is a chore. Good luck", "I've had her for two semesters now. Her lectures consist of showing us various definitions and examples, but not really explaining them. I had to learn most things by religiously examining the textbook and watching videos online. Going to class always felt like a waste of time., but it's required. Expect to be confused every class period.", "Worst professor ever! This class was 2 credits, but should've been 4. She gives too much homework & makes you do a group project where you interview other professors & students & she gives too many long papers for this one project, some papers not even related to our project. She is the only teacher that waits until the last day to submit grades.", "I feel this professor is not very efficient. She's a very nice lady and if you go to office hours or tutoring to ask her specific questions, one on one, she's helpful, otherwise she's not. I feel like I'll miss something if I don't attend class, yet going feels useless. The tests are nothing like the quizzes, homework or classwork.", "She makes chemistry sound easy. She teaches slowly, straight from her slides. The tests come straight from that, but be careful with math mistakes. If you have the choice of professors for this class, take her.", "In her probability and statistics class, she does not explain things well at all. She did not show us how to use statcrunch bc \"we can't use it on tests\" (it was made for online hw!) So online hw takes HOURS. She does not drop lowest grade or provide extra credit. So if you don't understand her complex teaching, you are screwed.", "It's an interesting class for sure. It's basically forensic anthropology. But it's very difficult. You have to write two 10 page papers and there are three testsquizzes that are only 10 questions long, and very detail oriented and difficult. You must study for these. Also, come to class, because you get a grade for showing up and that helps.", "She is a wonderful professor and you can tell that she is knowledgeable about history. She makes the class interesting and I ended the class with an A with flying colors. Make sure to follow her essay prompts, do the inquisitive, and have the book open for the test. She also gives bonus points so that's a plus. She's great!!", "don't ever expect Monica to cut you any slack. because its guaranteed she wont", "AMAZING PROFESSOR...SHE REALLY HELPS YOU SUCCEED AND HER CLASSES ARE VERY INTERESTING!", "READ THE MANUAL! As long as you show up to lab, you should be able to earn an A or B on the lab, but the quizzes are what will bring your grade down drastically. Make sure the read the manual carefully before class and go to the Biology Resource Center for any help. Know how to do any calculations because those are a good chunk of the quizzes.", "This was by the far the hardest class I've taken at BYU. Siegfried's expectations are extremely high, but I learned so much and am grateful I had her as a teacher, because every other class will probably seem extremely simple compared to hers. It's a lot of work, reading, writing, but she really knows her stuff and helps you whenever you need it.", "She was the most polite and helpful professor I have ever had. DEFINITELY TAKE HER!", "Class is soooooo boring, i can't keep my eyes open more then 5 minutes in there. Goes over powerpoints every class. Class only consists of 3 test (which are hard to pass and are long) a paper, and a family shield. The test are nothing like the reviews that she gives. I wouldnt take this class.", "Absolutely loved this class. The readings were fun and interesting which created great discussions in our discussion board section. Mrs. Lape was a great teacher and always seemed enthusiastic about the different writers and poets we learned about each week. The tests are pretty easy as long as you read the weeklies. She also gives 2 essays.", "Great Experience. Very know knowledgeable and helpful.", "I love Mrs. Ward! She is an incredible teacher and extremely helpful. I have her for Intro to Modern Dance, and it's a great class! Beileve it or not, it even puts you in shape!", "No Comments", "AMAZING PROF! Her course was informative and fun! She is very clear with the requirements of the course and what is expected. She incorporates videos, discussions, visuals in her lecture. Class just flew by. Just do your work, attend class, and you'll do great! She is also very helpful with the final essay. Ask her for help and she's there!", "I love this class. She grades very difficult and requires you to give explanations on EVERYTHING for the tests. She explains everything very well though and will answer any question you have about tax crystal clear.", "Very sweet lady. She is caring and wants to help you. The class itself is fun. Only thing I would change is to not have pop quizzes, but its college, so that's kind of silly.", "Oh my god this has probably been my worst experience ever as a student. She rambled on and on n on during lectures; about topics just barely related to the material. I tried to take notes, but honestly there was no point. There are wayyy too many readings to stay caught up on and they're quite lengthy. Tests are on ALL readings. Not worth it. AVOID", "Sensei Manes is very nice and funny. She is a good language teacher.", "EXCELLENT!! Now she is what an English teacher is SUPPOSED to be! I've never learned so much in that short amount of time. I gained a lot of knowledge from her class, and it will stick with me always. She's very nice, but very fair. Wonderful, wonderful...", "I would not take again she can be rude and snobby. Very opinionated and vocal about it. She gets too dramatic in her lectures, made me want to fall asleep. Her tests were so unorganized it was so frustrating. Knows a lot of information but lacks substance. Doesnt reply to emails, when she does its vague. Takes long to grade assignments.", "She really cares about our grasp of the material and tries to make us enjoy it. She may not be as rigorous as others, but she definately holds us accountable. I have really enjoyed having her as a professor, she is so knowledgable and really makes us think.", "No Comments", "Dr. Long is an amazing scholar and poet. Her classes are stimulating, but she won't hold your hand through them. If YOU don't show up for class or turn in your assignments, you probably won't be nannied, but you will fail the course. If you're self-motivated, responsible, and ready for mind-expanding feminism, sign up with Dr. Long.", "I really enjoyed learning in this class - Mima is very knowledgable and presented course topics with amazing enthusiasm. I didn't think I'd enjoy this course but I really liked the way it was taught. She is very caring and will give you the results you want, as long as you put in the effort she expects.", "Avoid at all costs. Nice person, terrible teacher. I'm going to barely pass, most of my classmates have to retake next semester. Only copies problems from the books, and gets irritated when was stopped to explain the steps. I spent a lot of time teaching myself from the book. Her grading system is very arbitrary too", "Best professor I have ever had, period. I loved coming to this class and always found myself drawn into the discussion. Gilson is incredibly intelligent and has a lot to share if you let her. Her personality is very bold, but I found that to be a good thing. You can rewrite anything and she is flexible, so you have every opportunity to do well.", "Really easy class- I got a 97 overall. Don't even buy the book. I never opened it. Make sure u go to class cuz u get quizzes and homework assignments that r not on blackboard. Those really enhance your grade. Easy class and she is a good, fun teacher.", "Please take her if you can. She made writing so much fun. She offered lots of helps on your papers.She wants everyone to succeed in her class. she often go above and beyond for her students.

While the content of her course isnt hard, the workload is demanding.", "good speakers", "DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!! She gives ridiculous amounts of work and is a VERY HARD grader!!!! She doesn't believe in giving good grades! WATCH OUT!", "These comments accurately describe the class. She does scream at the top of her lungs often, which is annoying considering my class starts at 830 am. She goes off topic way to often, talking about things that have no relevance to the class. Today we were supposed to review for the test, but we ran out of time and weren't able to.", "Now known as Patricia Farrish, Amazing professor. Laid back, understanding, makes class fun, light work load. and you actually learn. Reviews are exactly what is on the test, nothing will blind side you. Attendance is not mandatory, but I enjoy being there. This goes for ANY class she teaches. I've taken her any chance I get.", "I had Deb for several classes, and she is a good professor. She tries very hard to give her students the independence and respect they deserve as adults. She is very straight-forward and willing to help with any issues you may have.", "She is great! Very helpful and so enthusiastic about her job. She made the class very fun to be in! Has quizzes about what you talked about in the class the day before, has great study guides as well.", "A math expert with a positive attitude, very informative, and willing to stay after class to help students. Be in class everyday for her lectures because she makes the lessons simple to understand than reading over the textbook. The class can be a challenge with number of quizzes and homework to complete, but tests are the killers so study daily.", "she was so easy, its not even funny. i didnt do some essays, and she gave me A's for them. im pretty sure she was high half the semester anyway. but a really nice hippie", "No Comments", "Dr. Sydlik is the best teacher I ever had!", "great teacher! gives an easy quiz every class period that is only 2 or 3 questions and she goes over it directly before you take it. gives 2 weeks to complete hw assignments. very helpful, easy b+/a", "Test day is a nightmare. She is very concerned with making sure it is done 100% correct, which is fine, but she can come across as very rude about it. She touched my arm and lifted my sleeve to look for a watch. The tests weren't that bad honestly. The paper was more difficult for me. She is very specific about APA format, so be careful with that.", "She is super nice and helpful! The class is really interesting because Dr. Carmean created it herself. She loves her job and is always willing to help. If you do the reading and review your notes before the exams you'll be fine. She doesn't like grading so all the exams are multiple choise. She posts grades really fast too! Great Teacher!", "Cindy Herbert is a wonderful instructor. She's very concise and clear about the curriculum. If you don't show up, and stay the entire class, you aren't rewarded with attendance. Fair warning. I would definitely take her again.", "Took it online over summer. That was the first mistake, unfortunately I had no other option. Took her 1-2 days to respond to my emails & even then, they were unhelpful. McGraw-Hill based course which sucks. Not enough time for the exams and will leave you rushing to guess. Unnecessary/tedious amounts of homework which take hours of your day. BEWARE", "She is really nice, and keeps class interesting. Answers all your questions. gives you homework first day and it is all due by the end of the semester. its okay to miss class", "Although she is a very difficult teacher, she is always there to help. She is one of my favorite professors I have had. Highly recommend as long as you are prepared to attend class!", "Be vocal and participate. If she can tell you're daydreaming you're screwed.

She was my advisor too and helped me a lot.", "Very intelligent professor. Hard to understand her, shes really good about putting up test grades now. all notes are posted online. dont really need to go to class. no attendance. good for GPA if your psyc savvy.", "Yasmin is a wonderful professor and she is very down to Earth. She wants you to learn and is very understanding if you haven't had Spanish in awhile. Would recommend her for any class!", "she is awesome. lots of essays, but they are fun ones and she is great! :)", "I really enjoyed having this teacher. I LOVED doing all the homework online, the due dates are clear, extra credit is literally on most paper assignments, she's extremely nice, and has many ways to help when you're confused (Herself, office hours and e-mail, SI leader, YouTube links for help). There's a lot of work, but not redundant busy work.", "Very freindly and funny. Her notes and clear and organized which makes it easy to study for her exams", "I've had to take almost all of her classes for my major. She is the WORST. She is late for almost every class, unorganized, and rude. Her classes are boring and she knows about what she teaches from books (no personal exp.) She is also a BAD advisor!", "She was very rude and I would not recommend her. I had to switch out of her class.", "As an older student returning to college, she was so supporting and respectful. Since English is not my first language, I had anxiety to take any oral communication class, But in her class she valued my background, effort and my accent.She tought me how to be an effective speaker in the society.", "No Comments", "i have had this teacher for many classes and she is a wonderful teacher. she really helps you write in new and interesting ways. she may require some work out of you but it is well worth it.", "Everything I learned in Micro I had to learn myself.

She was never there for office hours, never availab", "Mrs. Johnson can get carried away at times and leave the students confused, but if you ask questions she will clarify things for you. She tries to read people's expressions, but no one is a mind reader. If you take her and don't understand, speak up! There were 4 tests and a final, the lowest grade is dropped.", "Yasmin is an ANGEL, hands down the best professor at Penn State. She's a delightful professor and really cares for her students. I went into this class terrified because i knew no Spanish whats so ever, she really helps you get through the class. She's helpful and humorous, her class isn't really boring at all. She's over all an outstanding person.", "Easily the smartest teacher at Denidoo.", "She is the abo****e worst teacher that I have ever had. I skipped her class for three weeks and still aced her test. All she does is highlight the textbook.", "She is very passionate about the topics but it's more like she is trying to convince you to be passionate about it rather than teaches you about the topic. She will ask you questions that no one knows the answers to because we haven't gone over it and then expects us to know the answer.", "He is a smart guy there is no doubt about that. But sometimes you have to just call it a day and realize it is tome to move on. The take home exams aren't bad but he relies way too much on the text and doesn't explain concepts well.

She's awesome!!!", "Ms. Yearwood overall a great teacher, she can be confusing with dates for assignments and projects, but overall she is very knowledgeable about the subject, if you just read the chapters you will do fine.", "For a science class, this thing rocks. learn lots about how the world works and some stuff to take home too. Like don't build your house on a floodplain:). Really pretty interesting stuff and she brings it down to everybody's level.", "Good teacher, strict, not hot at all.", "She's a bit of a tough cookie. In 2nd level she expects you to know the stuff from the intro course. That's fair. She just needs to be more explicit in her essay and test requirements. People can't get 60's for no apparent reason. Don't get me wrong, if you know your grammar, i mean KNOW it, study it, you'll be ok. I already knew it, so I passed.", "Her class is an easy A and she is a really nice lady. Sometimes she can be confusing but she is very approachable and will help you with anything you need. I would recommend her to anyone.", "Good teacher!!", "Oh my! Worst class I have ever taken. She talks all class about nothing. We received so many handouts which was such a waste of paper...her social process oviously do not represent her so told attitudes. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS!", "awful. lowered by GPA so much. do not take.", "If you want to make an A don't take her. She is to opinionated that if your answers don't agree with what she think is right she is going to mark it wrong. She doesn't know how to grade or teach.

Reading is minimal and test expectations are clear.", "Best math teacher i have ever had...very clear on every topic is willing to sit with you and help you out...i would def take her again...", "She is a great teacher! Very organized and she definately makes her expectations clear. Lectures are well organized, and she gives study guides so you know exactly what you need to study for tests. You often get out of class early especially on Fridays. She has a good sense of humor, and is very willing to help you if you need it.", "Very nice and understanding, but the only form of teaching is by talking and rambling for an hour. Says \"obviously\" at the end of every other sentence when nothing is actually obvious. Goes off topic a lot, but does get material in. She is very open to helping you with your work.", "RUDE! Not helpful at all.", "This class sort of like what you learn in high school, and nothing like 111 is. Dr. Miller is not a bad prof at all, chemistry is just naturally difficult to understand if you don't study it a lot. Homework was easy points but the tests were at the challenging level that they should be. They just need to stop making this class 8AM.", "A mistake.", "I really liked her as a teacher but a lot of the people in my class thought she was a tough grader. I did well in her class (I got an A) I think she grades easier if she likes you.", "It's been almost 20 years since my first class with her, but she still ranks as my favourite professor. Her intro course motivated me to change my minor. Wish I could take her classes again.", "Avoid this teacher! Even though her syllabus says no quizzes/pop quizzes she does them and puts them down as assignments on Blackboard. If your on her good side you might pass, but if you are on her bad side you might have to drop the class. Being late or unable to attend class isn't an option. Lots of reading, never satisfied with your work.", "No Comments", "Very hard teacher, makes you work like a dog for a good grade. Very condescending and unclear. Got nicer and easier halfway through the class, but only because one of the students nearly had a mental breakdown. Last half of the semester was fun. I learned a lot but still, I don't recommend taking a class with her unless you absolutely have to.", "if she doesnt like your writing style your doomed... i did not like her because when i asked her for help on a couple of essays, she gave me responses and then marked me down for the way she told me to correct them... shes nice but dont pick her if your writing style is unique and not to her liking", "was one of my friendliest teachers, and I learned a lot", "This class is hard when it doesn't have to be. She spends an incredible amount of time going over things like how to find mean and median and not enough going over new concepts. She does let you use notes for one test and drops your lowest grade. I got an A, but the class was much more challenging than it should have been.", "Homework is mostly ID's, gave 2 tests plus the final also 2 papers and you could rewrite the first one and two presentations, tests were not that hard she scaled both test, the papers are the most difficult but not the worst class in the world, i would really rewrite the first paper if you get a 75 or lower it's worth it", "Shes a very nice teacher and knows her material. but the class is a one credit class, and we have homework ALOT and the test are really really hard! I have a C so far and im working harder on that class than my 3 credit 300 level courses.", "She is one of the most amazing teachers you could have. Sweet, caring, and genuine. She really loves what she teaches and it shows! She makes English/Literature fun and is just a pleasure to have as a teacher!", "She is an amazing professor who goes above and beyond to make sure you understand the material . Take her over any other professor! I ended up with a B but only because i didn't study nor did i take the small quizzes important. The quizzes really add up!", "so easy. just do the work. even if u mess up on tests, she will drop the bad answers. great prof.", "EXTREMELY EASY A ONLY A DUMMY CAN FAIL HER CLASS. SHE TELLS YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL HAVE FOR MIDTERM AND FINAL I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER. I GOT AN A ON HER CLASS. DONT MISS HER CLASS SHE LITERALLY SIGNS YOU OUT AT THE END OF THE CLASS. SHE WILL LOWER YOUR GRADE AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ABSENCES OR TARDEES. SHE GIVES LOTS OF EXTRA CREDIT. TAKE HER.", "Worst professor I've ever had. One of the worst experiences of my life. She doesn't like to teach or explain anything to you if you had a question or problem with a lecture. She is completely USELESS. I think she needs to retire from teaching because I felt very alone in this process and at times helpless when I was stuck on something. NEVER AGAIN", "Changed a lot of the ways I view things. I have a learning disability and still managed to be captivated by the crispness of the information. Cold on the outside, but will engage with you with disarmingly genuine honesty when it is warranted. Tough, but fair. A force of positivity in this world.", "The made me feel bad about myself 3 times in one year, but i think that just taught me to be more confident in myself. So she helped me out in that manner. I think she has one mind set. Its her way or the high way. I dont let her bother me, but I can't say i like her, actaully i dislike her a lot.", "She's very smart, but her classes focus more on discussion than lecture. In another subject that might have been helpful, but in a Brit Lit survey class, I would have preferred to hear more of what she had to say and less of my classmates' opinions.", "Took her for Senior Seminar and she was wonderful. I learned so much from her and she is always willing to help.", "She makes attendance mandatory, when it's not at all. Also, the coursepack you need for the class, I only looked at it once or twice the whole semester. Read the books and know about the authors, you will get an A. Bring other hw to this class or else you will fall asleep!", "She is a wonderful person and I love her enthusiasm/passion. Super sweet and willing to help you in any way. The class was fairly easy. My only problem with her is that she is easily distracted and loves to ramble on.

Easy to talk to & extremely funny. Don't be discouraged by her loud voice. If you struggle in english, TAKE HER!", "thumbs down on the group project, but she wants to help.

If you do not agree with her, ask questions on assignments, or try to take notes. She will get defensive, tell you off in front of the class or just give you a bad grade for that particular assignment just because she can. This is by far the WORST prof. I've had since attending this school. BE MINDFUL of the reviews.", "Excellent teacher.

Never take her if possible.", "Challenging class. Ingrid is the best.", "Ida seems like a great nurse don't get me wrong, however, her class sucks.

The exams are all definitions of basically the same words. I hate that this class is a pre-nursing class.", "Dr. Lueck expects well-written papers. I took this in the summer and I was the only graduate student. Lots of reading and writing but passable. She had a lot of feedback on my paper but i got an A.

In sum: A great professor; you are lucky if you take Bio 230 with her.", "Dr. Spock was very good at giving lectures, but the course load is insane. I'm talking three or four assignments due every week. This was a general education course for me, but this was the class I spent the majority of my time studying and doing homework for. It is a very difficult class and you will not pass without effort. I would NOT recommend", "Her class was on Lacan, but when she tried to help us understand, it just made me more confused.", "Lecture-Lecture-Lecture it sounds boring but if you stay awake in class and read a few handouts you'll never need to open your book or STUDY!!! What you hear is what you get. So just sit there listen and get an \"A\". She likes participation and she's truly old school so show some respect and understanding for her style- and read your syllabus!!", "she totally failed me, and i was two points away from passing. plush she didnt count my extra credit assignments, which brought my grade down. DO NOT take her", "I hated her. She tells you at the beginning of the semester that you dont need to take the final if you have an A (or a B - I dont remember) Well I had whatever she asked for & she made me take the final anyway. She gives feminists a bad name. JERK!", "She is really sweet. Made it clear what she expected from students. Brought in department heads to talk to us about their research so that we could see what we would potentially be interested in. I learned alot about how to conduct research & I how to find a research mentor and start working in a lab. Final presentation & Term paper are reasonable.", "Great teacher. She's willing to help you out.", "Really exciting teacher. Very intense topics and use of knowledge, but very flexible on so many aspects of the class. The best advantage in her classes is be 100% honest and never be afraid to defend your theories.", "Had her for a night class. never went the whole time. did a lot of creative writing kind of papers. only 4 papers and have time to work on them in class. i would take her again. very help ful", "This is one professor i did not learn much from. When A student asks for help and she doesnt know how to explain it she'll say why don't you do it for homework. She also does not know what her own syllabus says. She doesn't know her own grading policy.", "She was a good english professor. There were times in her class where she loved talking about political and controversial things, which wasn't too relevant to english. But overall, she stayed on track. Her grading for papers is very fair and she gives great feedback on how you can improve. I would take her class again.", "Definitely too much work for such a simple class. She feels everyone is taking this class because tehy are interested in it, not because its a requirement. Her study guides are pretty vague but somewhat useful.The papers are about grammer and citation not content. The presentations also pose a problem since she gives no direction on them.", "She is SO politically biased, that she will demean you in front of everyone if you have a different opinion, even though SHE ASKED WHAT YOUR OPINIONS ARE. She also believes we need to get rid of math and science and focus on art. I'm trying to become a PA, what does that mean about my job?", "Personally, I didn't enjoy this class. While TAs were very helpful and kind, Professor Ho tended to go on angry rants during lecture. She's very passionate, but she would digress from the readings and run out of time educating us on the history. Tests were relatively easy if you did the readings...4 or 5 20 pages readings per week that is.", "She was very prepared, thoughtful and stimulating", "Dr. Burns may be unorganized, but she really tries to make the material interesting, and has a lot of unique knowledge about working class backgrounds. She is also very approachable and is interested in different student perspectives. The video choices of hers are also great.", "morna knows what she is talking about and has alot of knowledge in the design industry. She may not be as forceful as other teachers but she still helps out if you ever need it and will work with you outside of class which alot of other teachers don't do. I would recomend her for design 1or 2!!", "She is the nicest person ever if you have to talk to her about anything but she does get lost in her lectures sometimes. I would take her again for another class because she wasn't bad. The tests were straight forward and the papers were very reasonable. She is real strict on attendance and takes it everyday twice a day.", "She's a good teacher, but go to office hours, and ask her to help you with your paper. You learn more in her office than in class.A pretty meaty amount of reading, but not too bad.", "she is a alright professor just get u ready for the real deal so it's on how ready u think u r for college GOOD LUCK.", "Pretty good assignments, the course is laid out well. Crits are kind of unhelpful and sometimes don't make sense. She is extremely nice, however, and is very lenient with project restrictions/requirements/materials. Definitely a good introduction to 3D. Have fun, it's hard to go wrong if you put time and thought into your work.", "Hands down one of the best professors I've ever had. Very clear and concise, extremely helpful, and passionate about what she teaches. Do not hesitate to take her", "Newhart is crazy. The only woman I know that can say um and ya know forty seven time straight. Class is boring but a breeze", "Olga is there whenever to help you. Her over head notes a great and always the extra clarity thats needed is found within.", "This teacher is terrible, she makes everything into a joke.", "She's a very friendly and helpful professor. Memorizing names and dates can be a bit boring and difficult, but besides that, the class is fun, interesting, and relatively easy. Honors section is enjoyable due to the relaxed discussions we have about assorted, student-picked topics pertaining to Russia.", "Great Instructor!! Clear with directions, answers emails quickly & grades quickly as well. She gives feedback on the graded papers in the side notes which were very helpful! The papers assigned were interesting! She's a great instructor! I would definitely take again! Do the work & read the assigned readings to help w/ writing & you'll get an A/B!", "I was unsure at first but this clas tured out to be a lot of fun. The professor worked hard at making sure the class got the concepts of teach social studies. However, if you need a lot of structure and organization in your classes this one isn't for you. But, if you like to learn in a more relaxed, free flowing manner, give it a try.", "she is a really good teacher, has a nice personality. If you attend the class regularly, do your assignment, and be active, then you will get a high mark. I like her she is the best teacher in my perspective.", "The class was a very good class, and the instruction was very good. Mrs LaWald cares about her students and wants the best for you. all you have to to is be respectful. She is very kind and will help in any way she can. She is old style elegant", "Ms. Mitchell is awesome! She is so nice and willing to help if needed. She makes her classes interesting and fun. I have taken 3 of her classes and I wish I could take more! The only time I have ever looked forward to going to school is when I was in her class.", "She's a good professor, just very boring. You always seem to get sleepy and just want to sleep all throughout her classes.", "shes good. the fredrick douglas and primary documents stuff is whak though", "Dr. Parker is a very nice lady, but this was the worst class I've taken at UA. If you are a business major, do not take this class. You're much better off taking an entrepreneurship class in the business school, you'll actually learn something relative to modern day. The 2.5 hour class is all lecture from slides you could print and read yourself.", "One of the most knowledgeable professors I have ever had. Tests are very difficult, but you can study for them. Write down EVERYTHING she says because you will see it again. Don't miss a class because you will miss a lot of material. If you work hard you will do well.", "Don't take her if you have no prior experience with coding.", "An amazing teacher and a great human being. Knows a lot of the subject matter. Exams are challenging but great. Art Historians have to take al least one of her classes. You will be able to keep waht you have learned for teh rest of your life. Great Class.", "She is a mentor to me.... truly my hero Thank you Nancy Estrada I feel really connected to you.", "Hilburn was really nice, easy and simple. everything is spoon-fed elementary knowledge. I HATE history, and have therefore never retained anything from a history course till now.", "She talks a lot, and most of the time after classes you will wonder why you even went. Her class is very easy and laid back and I never got anything less than a B. Attendance is not mandatory and she cancels class a lot of the time.", "The questions for the papers are poorly defined and can lead to a lot of confusion when writing them. Fair grader. Very boring class, you have to read the book online so there is very little reason to go to her class.", "She is a sweet lady, but the most boring professor ever. Good intentions, but I would avoid her class at all costs, I fell asleep every class. I have no idea what the class was even about honestly...wish I didn't take her. It's a shame because she's a nice person, but not a very good teacher.", "Tests are impossible. Help is scarce, homework has nothing to do with tests. The notes make no sense to reread. Gives extra test on finals week along with cumulative final.", "sooooooooooooooo boring. Go to the class before the test day, get the review sheet and study that and you should be okay. She rambles in class and you have absolutely no idea what shes talking about. Nice lady but so confusing. Attendance isn't mandatory and neither is the homework and quizzes. Take her if youre good at math and can teach yourself.", "AN EASY 4.0.", "Wonderful prof. I didn't plan to continue on with spanish after I fulfilled my requirements, but she inspired me to do that. She's very helpful and is always helping plan very cool activities.", "Tests are NOTHING like the practice problems. Homework does not correlate with tests in the slightest bit. Notes don't make sense. Labs she is helpful but that's it.", "This class is an absolute joke. The class material will put you to sleep and have you wondering why you are even in the class. The teacher is rude and very annoying. It is a 100 level gen ed class and she acts like it is a 500 level class or something. Way to much pointless work, way to hard of grading work and in general just an unlikeable person", "She's brilliant and easy on the eyes.", "She's as awesome as everybody says. She truly cares for her students and goes above and beyond to further assist in learning the material. She sends reminders, listens to her students needs, and always motivates her students. As long as you do your part, you'll do great. Must take her class if you're looking into taking a child development class.", "No need to buy the book. Tests and quizzes are mostly matching and she gives you extra credit for drawing pictures on the sides of your exams. She automatically gave all of us A's on our first essay assignment as long as we handed it in-even the people who handed it in after the one week grace period, which applies to all of her assignments.", "You dont even need to come to class. I only came sometimes for the comfy seats. There is no late policy for any of her work. She doesnt believe in midterms or finals exams so thats a plus! Very easy if you put in some effort in her essays.", "Mrs. Haynie is one of my favorite teachers ever. She really makes the subject interesting, she cares about her students, and she's very helpful with students who need extra help and teaching more proficient students new skills.", "boring. weird. but kinda easy.", "Never have I felt like I've been in high school while college until I took her class. She values class room participation and daily homework completion more than any other instructor I've had.", "No Comments", "The class was easy but horribly boring. She has a background in counseling so she knows what shes talking about but she doesnt know how to teach it. she has stupid activities and an obsession with dumb discovery channel movies. she cant pronounce chromosome, and doesnt know what the hell shes talking about when it comes to genetics.Dont take her!", "This class is ridiculously easy. She goes over the readings in class so you don't really have to read. All hw, quiz dates, and essays are listed on the syllabus. She doesn't take attendance but showing up to class is the easiest way to pass. The tests are easy too -- she allows you to make them up weeks after the initial date. Everything is easy.", "I totally felt like she hated me for some reason. Everytime I walked into the classroom, I got a cold shiver and it wasn't the air conditioning. Her class was right after I got done student teaching everyday and she wasn't sympathetic at all when I came in right as class started even though I was NEVER LATE! Whatever, on the positive, she did have awesome clothes.", "This is the thing. Her class is so easy that it's boring. Also, if you are into meditating, this is your class (weird, I know). Lectures are on the internet; you take daily (EASY) quizzes, and work in teams for extra credit. The tests are the study guide (FANSTATIC), and she CARES. But she is not for people that have no patience.", "Awesome teacher. This is not an easy class where you show up and get a grade. You will have to work for it. She offers ec and study guides for the test which are essential. Show up, pay attention, take notes, work hard, complete the work, and study for the exams. Did not need the textbook, her notes and power points were detailed enough.", "Shea is easy and helpful. She clearly explains what she expects upfront and then grades according to the critera she set. Great online classes. Easy, managable and helpful.", "Ms. Weeks is French. A little hard to understand at first, but she's very helpful and a great teacher.", "I don't know a smarter person on earth, period. And this woman is an exceptional professor, wonderful person, and funny as hell. It's true, this class will kick your ass, but in a good way. You'll be thankful for it after.", "One word. NIGHTMARE", "Awesome teacher. Always comes into class fully prepared and happy to teach. She gives you weeks ahead of time so you can organize yourself early on. She has a lot of connections and experience in law so it would be wise to be friendly with her in hopes she can help you out in the future. Take this class, enjoy it, and receive an easy A.", "I am not an Art History major but I found this class to be very interesting. There is a lot of memorization required which can be time consuming. I don't think she was that hard with grading, especially if you take notes and study them before the exams since all of the questions come straight from the lecture.", "This was the worst. Her programs are long and the homework had no clarity at all from the textbook and her graders had to grade them without the answer key and grade a week after they are turned in along with getting the answer key. Her tests were long (coding part). She expects you to read alot from the book, but goes out of order.", "The class was supposed to be easy, but she's definitely changed it. Everything is graded harshly for a TRAD, and she wastes a good half hr of students time at the beginning of class then makes you stay till the very end. The sad part is she is a really nice person and open to helping you, but her class is BORING and too hard for a gened", "There is barely any interaction with Prof Iten.. the class is completely handled by the TAs. Do the pre labs, fully read and understand the lab manual, and go over the practice quizzes and you'll be fine. Not as bad as some people on here are saying it is.", "The class was interested I have to admit..learned some new things, and the professor is very passionate and energetic. I normally would not complain about the amount of reading in upper year courses, but she assignmed 100 pages + per week and almost NEVER discussed them in class. Also the poster party..honestly I felt like I was in grade 5 again.", "I learned to swim in her class & i had friends to keep me company. She just told us what to do & its fine bc i learned. there was extra credit to make up each absence & also helped to practice. A.", "tough grader!! her exams are totally off the wall! 80 questions in one hour time including an essay..however, open book..nice lady though!", "Odette is amazing. She has a lot to bring to the field and makes the information fun to learn along with making the information understandable.", "pretty easy class. she is very nice.", "Helpful teacher to any student and is easy to understand.", "Professor Pam was super sweet and always really entertaining. She kept us interested and was really relatable. Her papers were not difficult as long as you did (some of) the required readings. Plus, she brought our class 3 dozen doughnuts on our last day of class! NO FINALS IN THIS CLASS. I would take another class with her, for sure.", "I never felt the need to write a review about a professor until taking CS 140. Prof. Malaty is quite possibly the worst teacher I've ever experienced. She comes to class unprepared and is annoyed by any question being asked even if it's crucial to the lesson. I got an A after thoroughly reading the book and collaboring w/ other students. STAY AWAY!", "No Comments", "Dr. Blanck is so nice and always willing to answer any ?'s anyone ever has. You must do the readings each week for daily quizes and a final paper in which you incorporate an outside source not already used in class. Overall, very nice and loves promoting class discussion. A few chances for extra credit, but overall a good deal of work must be done.", "Susan is a fantastic teacher. I don't understand how people say she isn't, but to each their own! Yes, she talks a little fast in lecture, but has no problem repeating herself if needed. She is understanding, friendly, and approachable. Susan actually makes classes fun. I don't find her to be a hard marker whatsoever. She gives great feed back!", "I had Ms. Hampton this past spring, and I must say, it was quite a challenge. I can see why people may say that she really doesn't interact as much with the students during class...but on the other hand I have to say that she is extremely smart. She definitely knows her info. I received an A but it did not come easy. Overall, she was a fairly desce", "This class is pretty much self pace, but if you get behind it will be hard to recover. Try to complete a test a week.", "I was really excited to take this class, but it really disappointed. The worst thing that happened this semester was the online book she made us buy, but then told us not to use it after test 2 and we didn't get a refund. This class isn't attendance based, but I would really suggest going because the tests are hard.", "I Love Her Class...I Have Learned A lot!", "She is excruciatingly thorough, she explains everything in minute detail. But overall a good teacher. Tests are fair, harsh grading on easy questions and more lenient on the harder ones.", "If you want an easy class that meets GE requirements then this is for you, especially if your other classes are hard. She's nice and flexible. Often late, often cancels. Easy to impress her. Final is a fun puppet show. Sometimes tedious. The lateness got old too, but I liked the class overall.", "She is very ramdom you can take notes from her lectures because she can't stay on any one topic. Her tests are marked inconsistantly with her own personal bias for each individual favorite person. As chair person, LAZY is the only word that comes to mind, her needs are the only one the counts.", "Never though I'd be interested in a Victorian Novel class but thanks to her interesting reading list choices and informative lectures I warmed up to the subject pretty quickly. Not an easy, but rather a just marker. Do yourself a favor and come to class, then you practically don't have to study for tests.", "She's very clear and very helpful. There is no way that you will get a bad grade, or a failing grade. She makes math fun.", "Professor Chase is passionate about physics, which can be seen by her marked enthusiasm during lecture. She does a great job of explaining different concepts. As someone who has always dreaded physics since high school, Professor Chase's lectures made physics bearable, and in some cases, even fun.", "Don't get me wrong, I love Dr. Lorden to death and she's a really sweet, funny lady, but the amount of work she assigns is beyond ridiculous. Every night you have to take 1-2 quizzes, as well as around 50 pages of reading. In addition to that, there's frequent busywork assigned. The material was not that difficult though.", "This teacher seems easy at first but you should take it from all the students that she's had before....Run the other way when you hear or see her name for a class. She will leave you confused and wanting to fall asleep in the first 15 min of class, THIS TEACHER doesn't even run the experiments right, and her supplementary hour is just crap!!!!!!!", "shes nice and tried to make class fun sometimes, but pretty much didnt teach anything although she tried...she knows what shes talking about but didnt know how to teach it...we pretty much had to teach ourselves calc 2...i wouldnt recommend", "Poor teacher, not good at all, not fair and not qualified", "Taking this class right now and regret it. Was an A student and I am struggling in this class. Reviews for test but nothing you review is on the test. Makes simple things confusing,all questions are up to your interpretation and even some questions not in the book. You can know the material and still miss the questions.", "Very fun class. Probably because it was a 100 level though. Great discussions on the material and she did answer most questions students had. Tests weren't hard either. Again being 100 level class likely played a huge part in this as well.", "Love Dr. Jackson, if you need to take 301, take it with her! GREAT TEACHER!", "Dr. E is absolutely one of the best professors on campus. She knows more about Spanish than any professors I've had, and does her absolute best to help you learn everything you can. She integrates the language with the cultural experience and encourages students to expand their world, and to have fun while doing so.", "English with Greta is very laid back. She's a good teacher and likes to engage the class a lot. I wouldn't say she's a hard grader but you get what you put in. She really likes participation and gives reading assignments for homework. The reading can be boring but isn't too long. It's very possible to receive an A in her class.", "I took this class in the fall last year and I am looking forward to taking her online this fall. She is awesome! She genuinely cares about her students and is always available and willing to help!", "Comme la critique pr\u00c3\u00a9c\u00c3\u00a9dente mentionne : tr\u00c3\u00a8s souriante, ouverte aux discussions/questions. Malheureusement, le cours th\u00c3\u00a9orique ne sert qu'\u00c3\u00a0 fournir des colles pour les examens (qui ne comptent pour rien compar\u00c3\u00a9s au projet). C'est justement dans le projet que l'on apprend le plus! Un conseil : N'h\u00c3\u00a9sitez pas \u00c3\u00a0 vous investir \u00c3\u00a0 fond dans le projet!", "Oh my, I only have good things to say about her class. I was dreading comp II, but she made is soooo enjoyable...TAKE HER!! I have always HATED writing and all that kind of stuff, but she made is relatively fun for me! AND I got a good grade!", "Excellent Teacher", "had a very hard time following her when i didnt already know the subject, sticks to the sylibus and will not go over anything that she had already passed in lecture. aviod if at all possible.", "Dr. Spock is one smart lady. Not many people know as much about history as she does, especially when it comes to the Mongols and Russia. If you are a history minor or major you will benefit greatly from her class, however; if you are taking it for a gen ed then expect a lot of reading, taking notes, studying, and hard work. She grades essays hard.", "Will Take Her Class Again!", "Teaches a great foundation is art concepts and technique, takes great care that all the students understand ideas they may be unfamiliar with.", "she sucked.....really bad....i didnt get any Fing help from her at all...", "she hids behind a podium, reads from her notes the whole class, and has next to no interaction with the class. You don't have to go to her lectures as they are exactly the same notes that she posts online. As my first taste of a university level history class, i can say that i am not impressed. Anless u plan on a hst major, dont take this class.", "If you want help you have to go and ask for it. If you are interested in improving your writing she is an excellent teacher. If you just want an easy grade choose a different professor. She also uses class time very effectively. I have really enjoyed her.", "HIGHLY Recommend for research methods No text, No annoying group work, essay exams. I admit you will feel kind of lost in the class sometimes in lab but u will see in the end she is so much better than other research methods professors. If you don't understand speak up she is understanding and helps during office hours", "Very knowledgable and a pretty good teacher. VERY strict about absences and missed worked, and doesn't ever cancel class. Does a lot of partnering of students for group work and discussions. Pretty friendly outside class.", "She lectures from a piece of paper, does not write anything on the board. Most importantly she very rude and creates a hostile learning environment. she do not care about any of your other classes because she makes it very clear that her class is more important than your others. she is just very unprofessional.", "Slightly crazier then a can of dried peaches.", "Why is this women a teacher? My guesss is for the paycheck because she clearly has no interest whatsoever in helping anyone. After she stumbles in late, you will sit there for the most confusing 1hr 45min of your life.", "She's an okay teacher. Doesn't like when you disagree with her. Follow her outline and rules for speechmaking exactly. The final speech is really lame. Wasn't interested at all during the class. She is super hot though.", "funny lady, and shes hot. tests tend to be a bit lenghty however.", "Shes the worst math teacher I've ever had. I feel like she doesn't know the material, if she does she doesn't teach it at all. Her tests are not what she teaches. It's not even worth doing the 2 hours of homework every night because it's only worth 50 points anyways. She doesn't want to help or explain. She yells at you if you ask for help.", "No one here is an english major here, it seems she thinks otherwise. Take at least one letter grade off for what you think your paper should get. Every single word of a paper will be looked at with insane scrutiny. Avoid at all costs.", "If she doesn't like how your writing style, your grade will reflect that. Assumes all students are future journalists, does not have much knowledge on how to effectively teach a class, but knows a lot of real world journalism. very nice though.", "she is a easy teacher, but don't ask her to help you outside of class because she won't go out of her way!", "She is really nice and her class is pretty easy as long as you do the homework. When she teaches she can be pretty confusing but overall shes not too bad. She tries to help out her students any way that she can. I would totally take her class again.", "Such a great class! Her class lectures totally blew my mind and I learned tons of useful analytical techniques that I applied to other classes. I especially appreciated the time Professor Siegfried took to conference with every student in regards to how to improve their writing. Highly recommend!", "she is very strict and hard on students, but when the class i took with her was over i realized that i learned a lot more than i learn with easy teachers... shes also very passionate about what she teaches", "This is the worst professor! Lost my portfolio! Gave me a B in the class for no reason--I haven't had a B since my freshman year...", "This was my favorite class last semester. I think the reason it was so easy for me was because I was generally interested in what I was learning. She gave the option of using our quiz grades in place of a final, so I studied a lot for every one and got an A. I love the notes being on WebCT, too. Just an awesome class all around. She is so nice", "She is a fantastic prof. The individual who questioned her commitment to her online course has obviously never gone in during her office hours. So helpful and caring. If you are going to rate a college prof. you should probably spell check your submission so that it seems as if you actually have the intellect required to pass a college course!", "Doesn't like upper/middle class white people, I never felt like she was taking me seriously. I agree with the previous poster, she can be catty. Everything had to do with race in her class, it got old, fast. There's other literature to read other than stuff on race!", "I had Vida for one class her first year of teaching, and I can't remember what it was, but I remember that, although the class was hard, I really liked her and thought she was very accomodating to student's needs.", "I had Judy Gregg for child 112 and Psy 206 and she was great. You never had to read the book or use it. the notes are enough. her tests are also super easy and you just need your notes to study from.", "Take her class! She actually cares about her students and wants to help them as much as possible:)", "She's great!", "Awesome AWESOME TEACHER. Ms. Trish Yancey, of the Human Enviroment Studies department. She is an wonderful teacher who has gone above and beyond for her studies. She is down to earth and supports her students no matter what. She likes to say \"bad\" words in class. No Regrets in ths lady! Fav Teach!", "She is the best teacher I have ever had. She gives you a ton of control over your writing assignments and really wants you to find your own \"writing voice\". I would definitely take any class of hers. I looked forward to English class every week.", "Kate is a wonderful teacher who challenged me more than any teacher I ever had. ANY detractors are simply weak in intelligence and tolerance. Any person who is a true scholar would love her classes.", "I took Sipple spring quarter in 2009. I really really enjoyed her class so I took her again fall quarter of 2009. She is a very approachable professor. Her classes are mostly discussion, but they're almost always interesting. She's also willing to look over and give advice on students' rough drafts of their final papers before they're due.", "This teacher is highly unfair. She took off points because i rounded .306 to .31. This teacher also takes points off for not erasing something completely or having something crossed out on the page. I highly recommend that you avoid this class at all costs, definetly not worth it. Worst professor i've had so far at ccsu, i hate her!!", "NOT that easy to talk to", "The drop information says it all. As an intro class, this is nearly impossible because she can't help you even if you ask. The books that we buy are hers, and they are error filled and no as helpful as on-line sites. Although she will let you drop.", "(online) Her directions are clear as mud. She counts off for seemingly random things with no explanation or prior warning. Does not respond to questions and is very rude if she responds to anything. This course was insanely writing intensive (2 essays a week) and the tests were over unimportant details or not in the book at all. Avoid at all costs!", "Talks way too much about herself, makes unfunny side remarks,none of which have anything to do with the course which is actually, despite her, very interesting. If you want eye-candy, there are other places to look. Not hot, not funny, just... not.", "Class is difficult but very enjoyable.", "Professor Adams is a great teacher. She is very nice and very approachable. She always wants her students to learn and understand the material. You will not regret taking her class.", "She is a great proffesor. If you come to class and listen you should be able to get an A. She wears black all the time. Right before the test she will basically tell you what is on it just take good notes and you will do fine.", "Love this woman!!", "Easy class. The midterm is the hardest part, and she or her assistant give you all the answers the class before. I also took her for Human Relations. She's amusing and a great person. Easy Pass or A.", "Very passionate about Astronomy. If you have a question, she will answer it in a way that is fun, and easy to understand. 5 large homework assignments that she will guide you on how to do it. A lot of calculations but it is gone over a lot before you do it on your own. Easy exams, lots of extra credit opportunities.", "Im very happy I was able to hv Dr. Jackson-Jones as my writing professor. She is very passionate abt her work.", "Professor Shelton was one of the best teacher's I've had my entire academic career. She helps you understand the why behind the papers she gives. She is very clear on her expectations and is very enthusiastic on what she teaches.

The concepts that are taught are very abstract and I would recommend waiting until jr. or sr. year to take her classes.", "No Comments", "Mrs. Lair is the best math teacher I have ever had. She is VERY organized with her lecture notes and explains things very clearly. She is willing to help whenever a student asks a question. However, you must be prepared for the class. If you don't know the prerequisite material for the course, you are in big trouble. Be responsible!", "The worst teacher I ever had. So negative about everything, not understanding, and just plain unfair to people she doesn't favor. HIGHLY RECCOMEND TAKING THIS COURSE FROM DR.SHAW", "Nike is a real gem, and she cares very much about her students. She is sometimes a bit difficult to communicate with during classes, but she's absolutely hilarious, and a little patience goes a long a way.", "Excellent class. Good information for everyone to know. The first class is hard, but then the second half is easy with only two papers and she grades them easy as well. So don't let failing your two tests lead u to drop the class, because an A or B is attainable as long as you do the two papers.", "I was nervous about taking history in a mini but wow. No book. She gives you fill in the blank notes and her tests were so easy that you can't NOT get an A. I learned stuff too! I'm telling yall...take her!", "unrealistic expectations, snobby ivy league grad, rude, overbearing, ignorant,.... i can go on and on\r Basically she makes up her own criteria for citations and writing papers.... I HATE this class and professor. I warned you, never ever take her. Contemp sucks to begin with, but kimmelman made it HORRIBLE", "Apparently, it IS possible to make con law dull and uninspiring. My advice is to bring something interesting to read, she won't notice...oh, and get the Emanuels, it's all in there (unfortunately)", "Awesome teacher I took her for dance class. She is strict in her attendance policy and in other things but u only take 2 test that Match and she gives a lot of extra credit opport. all you do is watch videos.I really recommend her class it was an easy A", "Prof Leatham teaches in a way in which you learn or you don't. From the very beginning he makes it known you control your own grade. Lots to read but most readings are interesting. His style is relaxed, honest, invigorating, and he's most definitely a giver. Pays close attention to detail and is forgiving of fault. Hands down, def one of the best.", "her lectures are based off the book's supplied powerpoints verbatim. classes are very very boring. Tests often lose sight of the fundamentals. She is very enthusiastic outside of class, and her labs are fun. i don't really recommend her as a prof.", "Wonderful!!!", "Arghhh! What a nightmare!", "You can never appreciate Deguchi until you have someone else. She is always willing to help and the easiest theory techer here!", "Cynthia was a great teacher!

Apply yourself and you shouldn't have one problem!", "Dr. Spievak is an outstanding instructor. She is an expert in her field. As long as you put in the work and dedication, she will ensure that you do great. She genuinely cares and your work in her class can without a doubt take you far beyond the class itself.

Do not take, if you aren't willing to work for it!!!", "most fun classes ever..Julie is an awesome teacher and anyone who thinks otherwise needs their head checked...", "I only took the 6 week online course so there isn't much interaction but modules pinpoint the main concepts. She's quite responsive and course is very easy with her. Open-book MC midterms and quizzes are fair as long as you read the book and do the problems & module exercises. Very fair final (problems and MC) w/cribsheet. Gives out bonus marks.", "Her online class is horribly confusing! She is totally unhelpful and snaps at you when you ask for help, instead of answering your questions. And the assignments and readings she gives are not easy!", "I try not to think about her...I yelled at her a couple of times and she wrote that I have anger-managment issues. People that know me know it isn't true, but in her class..", "By the end of the semester, everyone loved her. Dr. Long is a great teacher. She loves her field, and she loves teaching those who also care about it. Just be respectful and you'll do fine. Also, never forget the space in \"a lot.\"", "This was by far the worst class of ALL my classes offered at KVCC. This Instructor talks way above your head.

Horrible", "Pretty easy class. She takes attendance right at the start of class. Easy grader and gives extra credit. Show up to class and take good notes and you will get a good grade. Class is very boring but she knows art very well.

She made sure all her students were up to date on assignments and her tests were fairly easy. Pay attention in class and you will do well!", "Somewhat condescending, but definitely one of the best teachers there. It might seem like she assigns a lot of work but NONE of the work she assigns is ever busy work (which is more than I can say for other professors). Do all the work and you'll get a high B or an A easy.", "She cares about students, tries to be helpful, but sometimes she gives general/unhelpful feedback. The class is lecture-heavy for a practical class (Software Engineering). The lectures are kinda boring, she often uses jargons/big words, which sometimes give the impression that she doesn't know what she's talking about or have real-life experience.", "She had a quirky personality, but in a good way. Not what I expected from her appearance or from someone so young. Don't let her looks fool you; she's very intelligent. Don't expect a good grade for mediocre work either; I advise planning your papers ahead of time. A bit monotone, but otherwise a good teacher and pretty down to earth person.", "Makes you work but is very riveting at lecture.", "I loved her class. It was very easy to get an A.If you do your h.w., class assignments and study, it wont be hard at all to get an A. There are tons of extra credit assignments.

I wasn't able to read music at all before the class but at the end of 182 I could read music pretty well. From this it shows that she is an wonderful teacher. Anyone will have a great time in her class. Just make sure you put your practice time in or she is going to know that you hadn't practiced.", "She is extremely nice.

If you can't understand her, then your crazy. She is sooo organized! & she has a wonderful smile!!!", "Rachel's class was transformative. She is real.

If you participate in discussions you will do well. She is fair and understanding and does not grade harsh. I loved her class!", "Vickie Lair is THE WORST teacher I have ever had. I would not be in her class if it wasn't the only opening left (wonder why?) She's confusing, forgetful, and very unreasonable when it comes to class.

Don't take her!!!", "No Comments", "Julia Rocks, she is so much fun top talk to! Love the Simpson quotes!", "Professor Woody seemed very passionate about the subject and I had no doubts about her knowledge level. She was enthusiastic and answered questions well during lecture.

It's a fun subject and she is organized and clear about what she requires. The midterm and final are extremely straightforward (just do the readings at some point). The research paper is work, but the fact the subject matter is interesting, so it goes by fast. I would definitely recommend this professor and class!", "McCluskey is the worst law professor ever. Avoid her at all costs. She can't complete a thought or give a straightforward rule. She never answers questions clearly. She took an interesting subject and ruined it. She makes you stand up when you speak in class, and nothing anyone says is ever good enough. I've never hated a class so much in my life.", "This class was a drag. I can't imagine anyone passing unless they took Spanish in hs. I took 121-122 and had 2-4 hours of hw EACH DAY. I even had to drop my other class just to keep up. The material bounces from one to another and it is very difficult to digest w/ her method of teaching. I highly suggest a study group. At least I got a high grade.", "good teacher. very helpful. if she herself is unclear about something she will check it out.", "Very giving of her time and knowledge.

She tries to get everyone involved and I think that is great.", "This woman is not only a brilliant academic, but a wonderful teacher.

All that, and she's ridiculously sweet and helpful, even with matters outside the course material.", "Unorganized, unclear. Expects students to read materials and memorize things verbatim for a quiz. If enough people fail, she'll give extra credit opportunities to hide her bad teaching. Weekly assignments (times two) get to be a lot.", "I didn't do well in the class, but this was a wonderful teacher. My grade was not a reflection on how well a teacher she is. Super nice, much better than the other math teachers. She knows her stuff. I hope I get to take her again!", "i hated her at first but as time passed by i began to like her. she is a good teacher and knows what she is talking about. She is open to questions. Pain in the neck about open-toed shoes in lab and attendance in both classes. she is friendly and cares for her students. I went from failing her class to getting a B+.", "I only occasionally knew what she wanted to talk about, and her syllabus lacked focus. She wanted to talk about too many different things, with the result that the course lacked coherence. Her lectures alternate between interesting and terribly boring, as she has a tendency to go off on unrelated tangents.", "Professor Borgwardt is a very good professor who gives engaged, meaningful, and insightful lectures. Personally, I can find her to be a bit verbose and can spend too much time explaining the philosophical concept behind an assignment. However, the quality of her lectures and openness during office hours more than makes up for this.", "Dr. Dunn is a great professor, really challenging! If you put forth an effort, you'll do fine. But, if you don't attend and don't study, don't expect to get any grade other than what you deserve. She's really helpful if you have any questions, but she can't help you if you don't try!", "Very unpleasant instructor. I immediately dropped her class after the third day of having to sit in her classroom. Miserable. Also the first thing she assigned was to write a biography about our personal lives and then present it orally in front of the class on the third day, awkward. Expect reading due every class and numerous essays & tests.", "Great, caring teacher! Always willing to help and actually wants you to learn the material.

DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER!!!!! She grades you wether or not you agree with what she has to say!!!! If you don't like George Bush do not take this class she is big fan and if you give a democratic speech ur gonna be in trouble!", "Easy class but she gets off subject bad. She spends most of the time taking about what to do if your going to be a teacher, which has nothing to do with the class. All the test are online but you have to look up every question because she goes over none of it in class.", "wonderful", "She knows the history very well. Overall shes an alright person but at times she comes off as tough, rude and strict. But still her class is helpfull and you will learn alot.", "You essentially need to have your book, and constantly read it in order to understand what is going on. She doesn't lecture, but has you become the teacher in the course and teach everyone else. It's difficult to understand what is happening because she constantly switches between talking about the class and hypothetical scenarios without warning.", "Requires a lot of reading. Nice old lady, who respects others comments. I highly recommend if you enjoy reading, but has limited office hours. She will do her best in class to help you with your essays. Kinda crazy lady though!", "try to stay away from this professor. rarely prepared for class. will often not lecture for a section, gives a handout covering section instead.

Friendly. Funny. Easy to talk to.", "She goes off topic a LOT. One time in class, we were discussing about literature, and then all of a sudden we were talking about Cinderella!!", "She's a good teacher, willing to help. She is CRAZY when it comes to marking, I think she forgot it was a frist year class marked way too hard would be great for a 3 or 4th year class", "Probably one of the WORST teachers you will ever have. You will have to attend tutoring or use Blackwelder's videos because this woman can't teach to save her life. Her notes are crazily disorganized so when it's time to take the practice test YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHERE TO LOOK. If you get her as a teacher..good luck", "This lady has a huge ego problem. She doesnt respond to emails when you have a question, and when she does get around to them, she treats you as if you are an idiot. I have never been treated so poorly by a teacher in my life. Honestly, don't take this class, because if you get on her bad side, she will be bias. Worst professor at NCC period.......", "I attended Eng300 and Eng302 at my high school. The homework was always interesting which made it easier to respond to. The best part about the class would have to be the discussions on the topics researched. You really get a lot out what you put into it and if you struggle, the discussion helps spark new ideas. I highly recommend this class.", "She is really passionate about what she does. She treats students like her peers, and is really open about everything. GO TO THE LECTURES. Even though they're not mandatory, if you go and pay attention, the written exams will feel like a breeze. She makes you read some stories, but you also watch movies too.", "Hardest teacher ever.", "Dr. Mallory is a great teacher. She is genuinely interested in all her students and makes it a point to learn everyone's name in the entire orgo lab.", "Very helpful and goes through the work very clearly.

Other professors are boring, trust me.", "Not an easy class - she has very high expectations, but you will learn a lot.

She's Greeeat!", "Fitzpatrick is a total valley girl that sounds like she has a 3rd grade education. Class was really boring. Watched old movies from the 70's/80's that didn't teach us anything. Had to write several papers. She's a stickler for APA format. She's overrated if you ask me.", "I took her online Principles of Management class... and wrote a LOT of papers. Basically, do what she asks by outlining the book and make sure to touch upon every point and you'll get an A. Gives out extra credit points for adding comments on discussion board, and is a lenient enough grader. Write the same paper 10x and get an A.", "sucks", "Gives very vague instruction, assigns a ton of reading you'll have to recognize specific quotations from for exams, very unorganized, wish I would have dropped the class.", "Dr. McFadden is one of the high knowledge teachers I've came across in my college career.

She rocks!", "Although this was an easy class, Prof. Pam occasionally went off topic throughout her lectures and was sometimes confusing to follow.

Last daydonuts so..", "Chase taught me absolutely nothing in her class. everything i learned was mostly through past exams.LEGIT THOUGH, find past exams cause her test will most definitely be the same exact thing. just different #s. the appendix hw are ridiculous and impossible BUT they will help you on your final if you are studious with it. FINAL was a killer !", "I do not recommend this professor to any students wishing interested in sociology, turned me off completly to the subject. too many classes were spent watching pointless videos..writing endless reading notes that were worth very little..if attendance weren't taken, i prob never would have gone to class..nice person though, not so great prof:(", "ask too much detail in her essay's and if u dnt have it she will minus every point till u have em.", "awesome! super helpful, fun class!", "Great class, great lectures.

You have to totally not care to fail this class.", "she good at keeping your attention. also helpful", "This is not your typical English class. Instead of dreary lectures we had riveting class discussions about shocking issues. In place of monotonous grammar homework, we had assignments that required opinion, thought, and action.

Great class.", "makes you interested in Botany! Excellent Prof.", "Lets see. for this online class she has made us read about 5-10 different small readings per week and then.... 60% is knowing small quotes from all the readings over the past 8 weeks.

Had her for this class and orientation to edu and I will take her any chance I get!", "Im not sure if she knows this, but not everyone who takes their class is majoring in history.

AND a school counselor advised me not to take her, so dont even", "She was very hard to understand in her lectures as far as the lessons were concerned. She read almost everything out of the book.

I enjoyed the class, we used the test and the tests came right from that. Make sure to study for exams, lots of memorization and cover a lot of material.", "Good teacher...very sweet and she honestly cares about her students. I think the bad ratings come from people who come in with a predisposition against math, and thusly take it out on her.", "Terrible professor. Learning Latin would be clearer than listening to this woman's lectures. She is all over the place and does not explain anything well. She gives paragraphs of instructions for an answer she expects to be a few sentences. Welcome to Hell", "She succeeded at getting me past my math fears where many others had failed miserably. A very warm, very motherly way about her. She's a hottie, too, but alas is very married with two kids.", "Please don't take this unless you really have to.

I wish I would have never taken her class.", "I took Spanish 1 like 4 years ago. I'm glad I chose to take Prof. Campos. She is so sweet and helpful, and tries to make everything as simple as possible. She consistently says \"this is too hard\" about examples in the book and simplifies them so the class can understand.

My writing improved greatly.", "No Comments", "Leatham spends about 90% of the time rantings mostly trashing students and the way we want to learn or are accustomed to do things.

He was a week late in submitting final grades", "Simply put: If you have an opportunity to study with Rachel Edelson, take that opportunity.

Lots of quizzes to cushion your grade. Love her!", "We were supposed to learn how to write a literature review. What the difference between a research question and a hypothesis is. How to write acedemic papers at the graduate level. Instead we wrote undergrad level papers about our feelings, no instruction from her on how to find previous research, had no idea how to write a Lit Review. Epic Fail!!", "Elizabeth takes every person as a serious actor who wishes to pursue this as a life goal. Also is very unorganized with homework. Little to no warning about work.

Please take the other teacher for this class, you'll learn more.", "No Comments", "This class was great. I loved the books we read, and the quizzes (which are taken after every assigned reading) were easy as long as you read. If you can't read then you shouldn't be in college.

Careful though, she was a much tougher grader than I expected for the big projects.", "She's a good teacher and a nice person, but the book she chose, which is about black women in the civil rights movement, is not at all my preference.

Very unwilling to help students when confused, and simply has no consideration for anyone other than attractive male students in the class. Avoid her at ALL costs!!!!", "I took this class freshman year and it was super challenging but really interesting. You have to work your ass off if you expect to have a good grade. It's hard to pin down exactly how she wants you to answer questions in the essay, but she's happy to work with you. Lovely woman!", "BVB is a lot of fun, and truly understands the hard parts of being a student (\"I won't make you do readings, I used to hate that...\") She has extensive knowledge, though I wish she would focus a little more on the art and less on the politics and royal affairs. If you take Northern, be ready to study many French chateaus and royal portraits.", "I took a class from Professor Siegfriend about a year ago, and I still find myself thinking about the thinks she taught us.

Amazing lecturer but horribly hard marker, she seems receptive to new and different ideas but even when a student has support to back up their claims if it isn't the same as hers you will do badly!

She sucks! For any of you majoring in science do not take her class, its a wate of time. She does not care and is not willing to help. To top it off she is not a morning person. So beware.. She will confuse the brains out of you and make your life a living hell in the process!", "Her teaching is elementary. She literally sat us down during one class and showed us a video of a man showing the process of how a first grader learned to draw a butterfly to a bunch of other first graders. Very rude, doesn't take the time to have conversations with students, and if you question any part of her teaching, she snaps at you.", "Professor Adams is very friendly. She likes to help her students to succedd. I very much enjoyed being in her class. Her assignments are easy as long as you stay on top of the work she gives.", "Interesting class, but not one that a student with a non-science background should take. Too much reading to complete in one quarter and nowhere near enough time for assignments.", "Mrs. Mulcahy was so easy, but the best part is I still learned in this class! Just do the assigments how she wants, have the book and the notes for the online tests, COME TO CLASS, and you will have no trouble making an A. Attendance is huge, and just try to understand what she's asking for on assignments. TURN IN EARLY WORK!! She's great!", "Fun and full of excitement. You must follow directions and listen carefully. In the beginning it may be easy but near the end of the semester she will give you projects with very simple and sometimes incomplete instructions but she expects you to do them and to make it perfect. She will also tell you due dates only once, so pay attention.", "Awful, simply awful", "Jasken's very nice, engaging, etc., but her class activities are a little too...squishy...to be relevant to the subject matter. I don't know why this was a 3000-lvl class. Also, it's teaching outdated technology -- not entirely Jasken's fault, but she clearly wasn't up on current standards.", "I really like Joan Krone as a person. She is nice and helpful. She is not very good at structuring a class, but the discussions we had were for the most part good. She's good at letting students set their own agenda and independent study types of things.", "Hays is definitely set in her ways but shes fair. Her rules are simple I dont know why its hard for people to follow them. Dont be on your phone, come to class prepared and dont disrupt class. She wants the answers on tests in a specific way but she gives you exactly what you need to study word for word so its not hard", "I had her for intro tap. She was a lot of fun to have as a teacher. I have been tapping since I was little so I knew a lot already but she had a totally different way of tapping then what I was used to. I found this experience a lot of fun and I am definitely looking forward to taking more classes with her!", "A very nice and a lenient teacher .Understands the students problems", "Very confusing. Weekly instructions reprinted from past courses with incorrect dates and misspellings. Poor instructor. She does not seem to comprehend higher level literature.", "WOW, Ms. Sailors is so hot and smart too! She showed us American Psycho in class. It was SO COOL--she's into the stuff I'm into!", "Avoid at all costs because she does NOT use Canvas and will never tell you what your grade is because she also teaches high school and uses that as an excuse.", "the best damn teacher ever!!!She makes algebra so understandable!!", "I loved professor Root! I had her for body conditioning and she was so nice and amazing. The class works you, and make you feel like you've had a good work out! Root really cares about her job, and her students. I would definitely take again.", "very helpful, she will make you love math", "She's very helpful and her class is interesting. You have to read a lot but it's a research course so you kind of have to figure that. Fun teacher though.", ".", "Very clear in objectives and expectations. Willing to help you help yourself. One too many group projects, though. If you're a fan of lectures, don't bother.", "Not a fan of math myself but she explains things in a helpful way.", "She's not very helpful. Ask her a specific question and you may or may not get an answer. Tough grader. She can also be rude. At least she likes what she does.", "I did not enjoy her really bizarre book choices at all. A ton of work to do for her class and way too much reading to do outside of class. Also, if you're shy, be weary because she really wants a lot of class participation", "She's a really easy teacher. She doesn't make it harder than it has to be, and she is very helpful when you ask for her help.", "Great professor!! Tells you to the smallest detail what she expects in her papers. As long as you try you will get a good grade.", "very smart", "She wrote this to the whole class: \"I will point out where your mistakes are, NOT what you must do to fix them. It is your responsibility as part of the learning process, to go over the lecture again. Then you should work the problems in the lecture and compare what you did with what is in the lecture.\" What is the point of a professor then", "Very tough teacher, if you have taken the pre-reqs and paid attention, you should do fine. This isn't high school people, take some responsibility for yourselves.", "Despite what other people have said, I think she's OK. Her teaching style is not particularly entertaining, but you can't always expect that. She does not suffer fools and can be a bit grumpy, but she teaches the material in a straightforeward, well-organized manner. Just make sure you think before you ask questions.", "Terrible professor. Out of 25 students only 1 actually liked her. It's tough to get all your points on her assignments. She requires students to write on the level that she does. If you're signed up for her get out immediately. First semester I had a B in English, and then I took her class second semester and got a D. Now I have to redo the class.", "I loved this class!", "Because she isn't a native English speaker, she can be confusing when she is lecturing; she mixes up the definitions of words... You have to do pointless check up homeworks for every class when, most of the time, she will lecture on that material later on. As I said, pointless. She grades your work not according to the methods but correctness.", "Well, I came into this class with a high expectation of this professor, since friends of mine really enjoyed her class. I found her extraordinarily difficult. She has you write numerous papers that have questions that are very difficult. She expects Masters level work out of a Undergraduate class. Don't take her unless you have lots of time!", "Mrs. Orella was a good teacher, you had to be in class and understand the work being asked to do, just like any other class. Her class wasn't hard at all, you had to earn a good grade, but this class did improve my writing.", "Awesome woman and teacher. Very clear about topics and what is important to understand for exams. Open to new ideas and methods, and allows for a lot of extra credit. Definitely recommended as a teacher for any class!", "She is the worst as a professor! I got a B and that's for fail just 1 test cause I was late that day, I got A in all the other test.... She confused the students all the time, and never ask cause she laughs. Btw.. She always give study test that are exactly like the test, sometimes test were even easier. Honestly I pass this class cause my boyf.", "I have taken 2 classes with Trish and she is pretty amazing. If you have taken biology or chemistry before Health class should be easy A. gives a lot of extra credit and her assignments are so fun to do.", "Yes, she is veeeery conservative but the class is not that hard choose well your topics and you'll be fine midterm and final are easy", "One of the worst teachers I've ever had. We had a different syllabus each week. She makes no sense at all. Her mood for the day determined what kind of grade you got on assignments. Definately would not recommend.", "She is a tough grader an the fact that the paper has such a significant effect on your grade doesn't make sense since the paper is on anything you want to write about. \r On the up side she does make the topic interesting and she really enjoys what she teaches. Also she is willing to work with you.", "professor stewart tells you up front what the deal is and you sign a contract and stick to it. no cell phones, no sleeping but its all in the contract and she will give you a chance to drop the course.first test for mid-term is 5 questions and the final is 10 questions and she give you extra credit. you cant fail this class unless u fill the blank", "Manatu is NOT easy, but she is fair, she cares about her students, and she is GOOD. I cannot understand how anyone could find this woman boring; her outbursts in class have cracked me up more than once. She can be harsh sometimes, but that's because she has a low tolerance for immaturity/stupidity. Do the work, be respectful, and try hard.", "Took Ms. Maleki for CNA. She's tough. If you want to be a nurse take anyone but if you want to An EXCELLENT nurse, take her. She does pick favorites and will snap on you. Just blend in and don't stand out and just learn what she has to pass on to you.", "Students actually teach the class most of the time with group presentations. Ferrante has no problem with interrupting a presentation to put in her two cents, but her comments are always helpful.

Dr. Wall is very helpful and one of the nicest teachers I've had!", "i had her last semester & this has got to be the best course i've taken during college yet! she's strict (no food, NO PHONES, & attendance is a must!), but she's also very cool and funny. there are only two exams during the entire semester, & the only work she assigns is optional/extra credit to boost your grade. this class IMPOSSIBLE to fail!!", "I heart Mills! She's the best Prof at Brock University. She's absolutely BRILLIANT.", "Best professor ever. She gets you to think on your own instead of just following what everybody else is doing. The classes are hard work but it pays off. She taught me a lot about myself along with the subject matter. I felt like she wasn't just an instructor, but a friend as well. She was very warm and open to her students and would help whenever it was needed.", "No Comments", "The class is easy if you just do the supplemental tune up homework to study for the exam as they are exact copies of each other. Norma herself has some quirky characteristics about her and lecture is like a random dimension and makes no sense. Just do the homework for the extra credit and you will get an A. The final is like the appendix though.", "The best teacher this department has. Learned SO much! A valuabe resource of information both in and outside of class. She may be tough, but you'll learn alot. Again, the best teacher in the department!", "I took her social problems class a couple about a year ago... awesome class.

It must have worked because I got an A.", "Workload was above average. Class time was a lot of lecture. Too much time spent on weekly group presentations.

Textbook needed for HW. Could share.", "worst teacher at AU", "hard marker. you can write a whole page but she will only mark some. Biased. favours many.

Can't sleep because she will catch you and make you watch.", "make 7 copies of the practice exam and continue doing it until your successful. make copies of the lessons and do along with her videos. in lab do all homework first then your quizzes.

I did it and i got an A!", "Is not clear on anything until after it is all done with; meeting with her outside of class is of little help. Did not seem to have any sort of grasp on class content. Had I known what I was in for, I would have taken a different class.", "Linda has a caustic sense of humor. Sensitive folks tend to dislike her. She speaks about highly academic subjects in irreverent ways but really knows her literature. If you get over the initial slight, and press her, she shows extreme interest in your success and learning. What more can you ask for?", "Grades papers kind of hard. Lots of group work. Such a big class & the students screwed around so much that you could never hear the lecture. At some point, you need to tell the class to quiet down. Some of us were actually there to learn.

It was ridiculously fast paced and I got lost since she is very hard to follow. I ended up relying on the videos that Blackwelder put up on her website. If you can, TAKE BLACKWELDER INSTEAD!

Easy going with students, as long as they pay attention and don't screw up. Recommended.", "--Gentlemen beware, she is out to get you-- Studied my butt off and got a low grade.

We had quizzes every Friday, which she curves. Participation helps because the class itself is very boring. She is NOT strict with dates. There were 2 tests, a midterm and final, we played Jeopardy to prepare and most people got A's. The reading is too much (50 + pages) if you're not a Theology major.", "Please please please avoid taking a class by her if at all possible.

I'm not very good at math and the material was challenging. Lectures go kinda fast but she always offers her time to help.

She's hilarious, honest, fun and intelligent. She loves to teach and wants her students to succeed. If you do the reading and answer the exam questions beforehand, you'll do great. I highly recommend taking her before you graduate from OU. Oh, and her class gets easier as the semester progresses. awesome.", "No Comments", "The class is easy, you just have to show up.

Sherry, you are the best, thanks for all the help.", "Professor Jost is awesome. This is a difficult class, but it's not hard if you apply yourself and do the work. My only criticism is that this could really be an online class. You come to class, open blackboard on projector, read powerpoint from blackboard verbatim, go home. North campus isn't the most conveniently located.", "Intro to Myths and Rituals is one of my favorite classes. Prof. Myscofski is fair, engaging and knows what she is talking about. *Spoiler Alert* We watched Star Trek in class. Whether you're interested in the topic or not, she presents the material well and the assignments are manageable.", "Dr. Wall is one of the greatest professors on campus, she's very helpful and she knows her stuff! The class is very interesting and it's very useful toward teaching-finally a class you don't feel like you waste your time taking.", "I dunno what this first guy is saying.

And yeah, she's concerned more with grammar.", "Absolutely terrible prof. Hardest marker ever and not fair at all. Watch out for definitions. You need to put down exactly what she says in class to score marks, and if you spell something wrong, your whole definition will be wrong.", "she is incredibley helpful and does not give busy work. She works around the students srengths and helps out with the weeknesses. Shes been one of my favorites.", "If you want to become misinformed about the truth's of the world take this professor. The answer for everything is War and America in this class. This is a class for narrow minded people.", "great teacher. made a really boring book interesting.", "Duma will be a good fit for you if you're good at self-teaching. Her midterms/finals are made up of difficult textbook problems and are doable even without consistent class attendance. Would recommend.", "This class is very easy. A short essay every other week and a few in class group projects. Judy is always 5-10 mins late to class and often cancels class. She is unorganized and her grammar/spelling on the board and in prompts is terrible, but if she doesn't like your wording in your paper, she will mark you an entire letter grade down.", "I dropped this class two times before because I was so scared to take Speech.

Lots of high graded HW. (I learn more by studying the material with HW as a guide, not doing hours of fill in the blanks) -A in 1 and B in 2 ( w all extra credit and it being my only class) Passionate, but needs to adjust her teaching style.

I took her for Modernism and will definitely take her for Postmodernism. She has great passion for the material that she teaches. It's a rarity to see these days. I def. recommend her for the Humanities courses. As for grade, it is whatever you want (no tricks). 4 quizzes, 4 short papers, very doable.", "The reviews about this professor below regarding what type of course work is expected during this class are accurate.

There is no textbook, but expect A LOT of reading of mini-lectures and articles. The 3 discussion posts a week take the most time to complete. But I did get a 95 on all other writing assignments because she is a pretty easy grader. I would recommend this class for an upper level gen-ed.", "This class is doable, but given another option I would have definitely taken it. It's a lot of unnecessary reading and responding.

It's entirely too much work for a gen ed course.", "If you ask her a question she'll answer it.", "Sets you up to fail", "MB was probably the best teacher I have ever had and SMC is idiotic to have let her go.

Do the work, accept criticism and improve based on that criticism.", "fun and nice", "Easiest class i have ever taken.

I had her twice in high school: for 10th grade honors english and shakespeare class.", "Professora Campos is nice and means well, but she is pretty hard to follow.

Thanks, Heather!", "I didn't think the tests were hard as long as you study! All the tests are essay, but all you have to do is study your homework questions which can be a lot.

WAY too hard for a basic math class. Lectures were SO boring and confusing, she just did problems the whole time which didn't help me.

I passed the course and her 3rd test. I did better in her part than in Prof Timme's section. Dr Fresso challenged me, she did her part and i did my part. I am proud i didnt fail test 3. I love her for the challenges of GIGU.", "Worst teacher ever. i swear every time I walked into that class my IQ dropped. The teacher is late all the time except when there' a test being given.

And don't bother asking questions. she just laughs and makes you keep guessing before telling you the answer and wastes half the class time doing so", "No Comments", "I have never had a professor who was more vague on what she wanted from us when it came to assignments. The only student who got above a C was the girl who got Dearing a fifty dollar gift-card to D&D. This teacher does not care about her students and her lectures never matched up to what we read in the text books. Avoid her at all costs.", "I love Elizabeth. Her lectures are so interesting, she keeps you on her toes. She expects your best but is understanding when you can only give her less than your best. You should def. take this class, it is awesome!!!", "Former English Teacher; More concerned with mechanics; citation style; and citation style trivia then paper content, analyses or provocative ideas", "Don't let all these bad comments scare you off. I took adolescent psychology in the summer with Dr. Zlokovich.

Her lectures are very involved, and she goes out of her way to make you want to do better. Her enthusiasm, both in person and when grading, made me nostalgic for high school days.

She is quite hilarious and tries to make the subject as painless as possible.", "I disliked. She gave you a good grade if she agreed with what you said, and not such a good grade if she didn't. Too subjective, and English teacher like. Only taught about France and nothing else. I didn't learn anything important. I would not recomend unless you area an ass kisser!", "She's funny as no other, but the feedback from her is negative. She has lots of things to teach, but she force feeds it down the throut in an unpleasant manner, exept when she relates the subject to mama's food", "She is a really great teacher and is one of the few profs i have had thats relates to students well. She is very understanding and will give you test questions on a regular basis if you go to class. I would strongly suggest her. She does a good job at making class interesting and making the material understandable.", "Karen is nice. She gives a reading quiz but then goes over what you just read the next class so it can be boring. Do the homework, memorize a bunch of stuff, and you'll be hard pressed to get less than a B.", "She's amazing. Very easy class. I was scared to take this class cuz I hate talking in front of ppl but I got A- with almost no effort and late speech. She's fair and helpful. Explains the material over and over again.", "Adele is the most amazing professor I have ever had! All these ratings stating she's a horrible professor are probably from lazy students who refuse to think out of the box!

Dr. Lape is great!", "Always late and scatterbrained. The group projects were fun. When you write papers for her she grades horribly.

She moves on even if you don't understand. doesnt follow through on her help", "Hardest grader in the BYU English department AND you have to get a 95 to get an A. Basically means that getting an A is impossible (though A- is achievable for the work of an A+ in a different English class). Learned a ton, but worked a ton for it as well. Dont regret taking the class but probably wouldnt take again.", "Without a doubt the absolute worst teacher in Neumann college. You cant understand her and she makes absolutely no sense", "Not even worth it to go to lecture. She simply does the exercises and problems from the book and does extensive, pointless proofs. I found it easier to just read the textbook and teach myself. Pray for a good TA.", "Last class she said \"sure\" 79 times. Emphasizes words to the point where you can't even stand to listen to her talk. Emphasizes S's --soo annoying.", "Great teacher. Very calm, clear, and approachable. She is very helpful and makes herself available for students who have questions. All in all a good experience.", "she is nice. take her class", "Just Amazing!", "I took her just for an arthumanities and since I like to write, I thought this was perfect. In this class we all sat in a circle, had group discussions, critiqued each other, and she gave awesome feedback. It's very open and laid back; plus she's hilarious and sweet.", "Professor Lape has been one of my favorite professors ever. I've taken two courses with her and wish I could take more. She encourages discussion of different view points and is incredibly supportive. The best part is her feedback! Every paper I turn in is returned promptly (which is rare!) with a grade and in depth feedback throughout my paper.", "Wonderful teacher! Smart, friendly, and helpful!Kinda hard at first but if you make an effort you can do great and learn a ton from her! I wish she had ENGL 1302 in the classroom. It would probably help a lot of students!!!", "She's very understanding and wants her class to pass. She explains what is being read and discusses the chapters for a better understanding.", "She is known as \"failing feth\" she doesnt care about her student's grades at all and if you ask for help she laughs at you. I disliked her.", "Professor Lindahl is easily one of CMU's best. Plenty of extra credit opportunities, and attendance is not taken, although there are weekly \"quizzes\" that you can use notes on. You have to attend 2 concerts outside of class and write a review about them but it isn't as bad as it sounds. This is a very easy class, and Susan only helps to prove it", "Dr. Hirsch your so cool! I loved your class. It was easy to understand and the tests were not only mind boggling, they were fun because they were sooo hard. I LOVE YOU for making me learn.", "I didn't take her for a class but I did attempt to be a part of her research. Had a meeting with her and she was completely rude.

Wasted 45 mins in her office.", "I took Human Female and BBD. It was somewhat interesting and the information would probably be helpful to most. There were three ten page research papers due in HF and 2 in BBD;she expects you to follow the rubrics VERY CLOSELY. The tests are are challenging and consist of labeling, fill in the blanks, and multiple choice. My best advice is to stud", "the material in this class is sooooo simple, but people will waste time with dumb questions that she just explained, I would say that the students mess this class up not the teacher.", "Worst English teacher every.

In class she only talked about strange critical theory and it mentally healthier to just zone out her lectures.", "SO ATTRACTIVE SO SMART AND SOOOOO BRITTISH WHAT MORE COULD YA ASK FOR!!!", "Dr. Jacksons 201 class is so simple. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on tests/homeworks come straight from lecture notes. 4 tests, but the first 2 are part online and part essay, and the essays she gives you to study before the exams. The other 2 exams are part take home and part essay as well and so simple. Attendance not mandatory, but points a", "Very knowledgable and pretty funny.

Class can be boring at times and never gets cancelled.", "No Comments", "She's okay. Material is really boring and she doesn't help making it any better. SHE LOVES TO TALK. Hour and fifteen minute class and she talks the whole time. She'll tell you a million times her husband is a pilot and loves to boast herself and talk about all her research but the class is pretty easy if you just study the power points.", "Theatre 375, and Joanie, is amazing. Since it is a class where we perform a play to an audience, she can get strict at times but only because it's a production so class is mandatory, like play rehearsal. She is so much fun and makes theatre fun. If you've never acted, this class is perfect for you. Joanie is vibrant and loving and extremely cool.", "She's fair and knows what she's talking about. Lectures are inconsistent; sometimes she hides behind the podium and other times she is engaged and charismatic. DON'T buy the textbook, you can get away with just going to class. I liked her and would take her again", "No Comments", "sweet", "Don't like her much. Picks her favorites and sticks with them. Such a young teacher, but acts like she's 87 years old.", "She is a very unreasonable tough grader. Attendance is mandatory although you are allowed to miss four class days she will not respond to your emails about missed work. She hardly teaches so be prepared to read and seek tutoring . If you have educational questions about a lesson she will embarrass you and ignore you as well.", "Very interesting course, although Cathy says it's the last time she'll teach it. Make sure to attend every class- attendance is a big factor. Also, keep up with readings and responses because they account for the majority of your mark. There was a lot of time for personal reflection, which was enjoyable. Good class :-)", "Take this course if you're ready to be treated like you did nothing. She's great outside of class, but it's her way or the high way.", "Russian History: TOUGH CLASS! But she will warn you of that ahead of time. However, VERY helpful to students both in class and outside of class. Russian history was very interesting though there is a LOT of writing.

So hard to understand and never stays on track with anything! Worst teacher I have every had.", "No Comments", "She was the best history teacher I've ever had in my life!

She captures your attention and if you go to class she helps you understand the essay prompts and suggests general ideas.", "Really Understanding and fair Professor. She does the job perfectly. She allows chances and make up works. She gives out extra credits for you to show your efforts to recover your mistakes. She is good at what she's teaching.", "Hands down one of the nicest professors I've had so far. She is extremely helpful and is always willing to go over the material if you were to ever have a question. She even helps you out with the homework. Study the book and the notes and do the hw and you should be fine.", "Very difficult to understand. Teaches as if we should all be experts in Economics. Mid-Term and Final exam awful.", "She is a nice lady, but she is not always the easiest person to follow. It might not have helped that her class was only 50 minutes long, but I didn't really learn much during her lectures. I had to learn and figure out things on my own. The assignments were almost all consistent of MyMathLab questions that didn't do too much. But she is nice...", "Very nice, funny and helpful teacher. Loves what she's teaching and although its an easy A class you do learn. Test are mix and matching and she reviews exactly what's on the test.

Her lectures are very interesting. The class overall was very interesting. Especiallly because shes into what she does.", "Dr. Hirsch is a nice professor. Despite hideous remarks students have made, they have not taken time to communicate with her. Thus, they R lost in the material & topics. You REALLY have 2 WORK HARD in her class 2 succeed especially when most students R planning 2 apply 2 professional school. CV & Personal Statement R required for a reason!!", "Prof P is the best! To those who said she was biased: She's only biased against people who don't care about the class/don't show up. I wouldn't recommend the class to people who aren't interested in advertising or people looking for an easy A. But if you show up, hand in decent work and participate she's a great Prof and you will do well!", "Good teacher. Easy grader.", "great class, great teacher. very clear lectures, de-emphasizes test scores and puts more weight on papers because they are clearer indications of what we actually learn.", "Dr. Allameh rambles on wild tangents. If you like that kind of thing, she's great. You can earn an A if you do all the work and if she likes you. Take an interest in what she talks about. Ask her for extra resources.", "I hated this class. It was so pointless and she often contradicted herself, and the TA gave conflicting information. The midterm was easy, but the papers are so ambiguous even with her verbose notes in the syllabus and on handouts. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.", "She is amazing professor! Her explanation is so clear and so easy for understanding so you can forget about math problems that you had before :) Moreover she has warm heart and she is very kind professor", "By far the hardest class I've ever taken. This class was SO hard. I studied all the time. Cynthia's lecture is all over the place and it makes it very hard to take good notes. She's very scatterbrained and her lecture is confusing with the powerpoint she makes. She won't help you very much in the lab. Wish I could explain some more but I ran out.", "So I heard amazing things about this prof before taking the class but she was actually not that great. I find that she was sometimes all over the place and not very organized. Also not very approachable. The exams were not representative of the material learned in class and they were brutal especially the final. Still managed to get a good grade...", "I took her for fiction writing I and she was really good. Attendance is mandatory but she is easy if you have an excuse. Very nice and helpful but dont take her if your looking to get an easy wri grade or if this isnt for your major. you do do ALOT of writing assignments & you have to read a couple short stories for every class. overall good teache", "sour and not friendly to students. i dont think she likes her job very much.", "great lady, but class is hard", "Unclear and seems to enjoy conflict.", "She is a challenging professor but is incredibly organized and one of the best professors at AU. If you have questions, you have to go to her but then she will do everything she can to help you work out the question. If you want an easy A, this isn't the class for you.

And she is incredibly helpful.", "toooooo much damn work", "Easy class. Material is interesting and easy. TA's were very helpful and friendly. Dr. Todd was MEAN though. Asked a question outside of class and she was very condescending and rude. Very discouraging since I had always heard great reviews of her.", "Sensei Manes is great!

Doesn't communicate good with students. Take someone else if you can.", "I got an A in the class, but i hated going to class. I dreaded it. When we were in class we didn't even talk about history majority of the time. You have to read four chapter books and do a book review. Those are your tests. If you don't read, you won't pass. The quiz's were a pain. She gives so much info, that it is hard to get ready for a quiz.", "She is all over the place. Quizzes time you meet. She expects that you can write a PERFECT essay in 12 minutes (these are her quizzes). Tons of reading to do along with \"participation\" essays at the end of the class, which is timed & graded as well as the quizzes. She is extremely picky when she grades. You'll get a B- if you lucky.", "I took her printmaking class. It was very fun! It is not like a highschool art class, where you just make art and it is cool - you must try to make good composition (she cares more about that than subject matter). If you can understand the way she thinks, then you can figure out what she wants and do it! She is a great teacher and knows her stuff!", "No Comments", "She's so nice! Such a fascinating class.

She is very funny but rude at time . The class is a easy grade tho . The book is not really needed buy an online book for cheap .", "She was very rude, didn't let you ask questions if you were unsure about her assignments (which was like all the time). She was absent every class after the first month of the semester, no warnings, notes, anything. It was a horrible class.", "In person (its an online class but we had a mandatory orientation for an hour), she's kind of hyper, a little intimidating. The online course is somewhat confusing, if you don't look all over the place for clues on deadlines, instructions, etc. you're gonna have problems. She is a bit unclear, and that is why I prefer to actually go to a classroom.", "she is good but gives a lot of homework", "WONDERFUL professor. Makes a tough subject easy to understand.

I had prior knowledge of ASL when I got here, but I think she'd be great even as a first-year teacher.

FYI: the classes are all in ASL because April is Deaf.", "Very hard teacher.", "no comment", "Very dedicated professor. She's great at explaining complicated theoretical texts and connecting them to the \"larger picture.\" She's a tough grader, but here's a tip: if she allows you to turn in a rough draft of any essay for her comments and suggestions beforehand: DO IT.

I had to teach myself the whole time. math ideas is theoretical math, meaning work problems, puzzles, etc. This was not for me I am more of a Algebra and geometry type.", "One of the worst teachers I have ever had,always late, doesnt know one thing about the topic and loses everything you give her and grades you on if she likes you or not she can care less about the work the student has done", "Very fair grading. You never have to read, just show up to class.", "Very nice lady; very helpful. She's almost annoyingly organized, but you can always know your grade if you send her an e-mail. The way she talks is sometimes annoying, but the class is so easy it's worth putting up with that.", "Not very interesting. Pretty easy but class drags on forever. Doesn't seem like a very empathetic person.", "This class is complicated at best. The class is seminar format with group discussions on every book. She gives insane writing assignments that make no sense. She is very nice, but the papers should be used for a creative writing class, not this. Overall though, its an easy class. 50% of the grade is simply showing up. The other 50% is essay-based.", "Marxist, feminest, arrogant... Her classes are more about her political agenda than the science of archaeology. Too bad she is the only archaeologist on the faculty at EKU.", "No Comments", "Class structure is great honestly; just do the online homework, exams, and papers. If you try to speak with her outside of office ours (even if it's before or after class) she won't talk to you and is quite rude about it. Feedback through e-mails are short and obviously rude. Lectures and PowerPoints are very non-specific and all over the place.", "I took this class, Anthropology of Humor and Laughter, and many told me it would be very hard. I took it anyway because it seemed interesting. Ewa is interesting, engaging, and her class is easy if you know how to pay attention, write, and apply topics. Easy class. Nice lady.", "Shes helpful and fun. But I wouldnt take the class again.", "Took her online. Very easy class and as long as you participate you are golden. The only problem I really had was the discussion boards because it seemed that she just gave you whatever she felt she wanted to at the time. It worked out for me though. She usually quick to respond if I had a question. Overall, I say definitely take her.", "Professor Malaty has a very poor teaching structure. From day one she expects you to know how to write a program, and she get's annoyed when your asking her for help. Only take her class as a last resort!", "she is a wonderful teacher. notes are critical. the book was never used. tests are purely from the notes and observations are done. very interesting course material.", "A great class. She makes law interesting with real-world examples.", "Professor Saunders, is very clear on what you should expect for a lit class. If you have questions ask her, If you don't understand why you got a certain grade, she will answer it, and give decent to good feed back. Also, make sure you do the work, PARTICIPATE at least three times on the discussion board, and she is very FAIR with grades as well.", "blah. this girl doesn't say a damn thing. just nods yes or no. her assignments can be really friggin coool though. but you won't retain anything from her - only from working yourself.", "She knows how to teach the Math and you will never leave her class with questions on clarity, gives Homework everyday but its only to benefit you! took her spring 13 and I learnt a lot in her class ,you wont get a better education than what she can offer her students and she cares and will always help with any subject matter you may need !", "I hate Spanish but Yasmin is great. I struggled in spanish 2 but am doing great with her. She actually cares about her students and will go out of her way to help you. Try to take her if you have the the chance.", "This lady is amazing. She's the most accommodating professor ever, sometimes to the point of being a little too easy on her students. However, at the same time, she provokes students to participate in very intellectual thought and conversation. I highly recommend her.", "hard class. quizes once a week. she is super smart when it comes to math but doesn't always know how to teach it well. wouldn't recommend if you did not have calc before", "Great class! Enthusiastic professor, she made learning fun, and I have a great transfer portfolio. She helped me get into my transfer school too. Thank you.", "Incorrectly posted a grade and didn't inform me until further communication was made. This is not a good class to take during the summer, the presence of a prof is needed for success.", "She helped me understand myself and society. I took her for 4 courses and loved every one of them. I couldn't stand to miss class because her lectures are so interesting. I love the way she has students discuss topics and reading assignments.", "Very good teacher even though she is a little into \"man-bashing.\" I would advise anyone to take her classes as she is a very fair and intellingent instructor.", "Soni is such a great teacher!

I dropped her class after 1 day because she talked in circles and had a very strict attendance policy.", "I feel bad here, but all I can say about the online class I took with her is \"third time is a charm\"....Partly my fault for not studying as much as I should have..But she wasn't all that helpful either...", "Tuff teacher but b/c she wants u to learn, if ur lazy and are not willing to study and learn the material do not take this class b/c it is hard so, do not blame teacher for ur lazyness.", "Mrs. Johnson is an all around decent professor. I am not good at math whatsoever, so I have trouble in her class. However, she is understanding. Do not miss her class if you don't have to, trust me, you will regret it.

She's a really nice lady, and helped me out a whole lot even though I'm HORRIBLE at math.", "I liked the class and the readings.", "This class was very boring, and she was trying to go over everything without any clarification. She was so focused on getting it done rather than making sure we actually learned the material.", "Dr. Wall is wonderful and explains things very clearly. She is very strict on attendance though... make sure you are in her class every day or if you do have to miss it make sure you have a good excuse. Overall this education class was wonderful and she knows her stuff! I would recommend her!", "Do not have her as a professor. She expects yout to know everything with no explanation as to why or its purpose. The papers were confusing and unclear at best. The final was impossible and pointless unless you wrote down every single word she said throught the semester. Avoid at all costs.", "She is pretty hip for her age, and is quite informative and is easy to get along with and it is an easy class to pass", "She's a great person and teacher. She might weird you out on the first day... but it's the first day. I ended up liking her a lot. Allows you to manage your working time and she'll recommend what you should have done... obviously there's a due date for the essays. Typically excepts work after deadline... but DON\"T PUSH IT!", "She misleads you. She doesn't follow through.", "Class seems easy. Attendance and Edmodo count a lot. Does not allow, food, gum, cell phones, nor drinks in the classroom, not even if its a 3hr long period. Other than that class is not that bad. her tests can be hard, but if you look over the chapter and notes, test should not be too hard. She would send out a review for the test, pretty helpful", "Mueller is a very oblivious professor. She sometimes just goes on random rants that make no sense what so ever and have relation to the topic at hand. During the start of the year I was looking forward to Sociology but now this field is ruined for me because of the experience in her class.", "Dr. Dogru always had well planned out packets to give us. However, we basically had to learn the material in groups before she would teach us how to do it. She was very sweet and was always available for office hours. She didn't put homework grades in until the end so I thought I was getting a C when I really ended up with an A-.", "I spend to much time doing the lab whcih is not co-related to the course and teaches you nothing.

She's really passionate about her field and her knowledge and research is impressive. She wants you to be as passionate about the information as she is.

I have recommended this class to some many people.", "I hated the course and the way the professor interacted with the students. I think she needs some people skills.", "She is one of the most detailed professors that I've taken. She is concerned about students and their learning, and she is willing to help in any way that she can. I've taken her 2x's and she knows her stuff.", "Stay as far away as possible. If you're on her good side, it's fine, but if she doesn't like you, it's better to withdraw early. She lets her feelings about students she doesn't like influence her grading! Also, her instructions for papers are extremely vague, and if you miss some small requirement she will penalize heavily.", "Great class- I learned A LOT! Tests are VERY comprehensive, both from the lectures and the book. A challenging class but well worth it!", "Great teacher. There may be a lot of reading...but she never asks tricky questions and the final exam is the exact same questions.

If you're there its hard to fail. Lots of the lab material along with a 30 minute video every week has to be done outside of class.", "By using a mix of humour Julie turned a terribly dry and boring subject into a fun and informing class. She is the best professor I have ever had. Im just mad she doesnt teach 2nd year!", "She is a very nice and helpful teacher although, this class is ridiculous. The test are hard because it is all memorization and you don't know what will be on the tests. I would like this class better if it wasn't so hard. Very relaxed class. You get a lot of good input from this class with cool art projects Class stunk, but good outcome.", "She has good teaching techniques, but if you have problems memorizing information this is definatley not the class for you. Granted I am doing well in the class, but its all from guessing pretty much. Alot of the material contains material from recent chapters. The art activities are great though!", "Dr. Miller is awesome! I hated chemistry in high school and after taking her class I don't hate Chem (as much). She is so nice and willing to help if you ask her! Definitely take her if u need Chem 103. The class wasn't that hard. Just make sure you stay on top of the work. Homework on D2l is due every week and test are frequent, not too hard.", "Awful teacher. Incredibly boring. Would teach lectures and no one would show up.

She is very easy to talk to in or out of class, very down to earth person.", "Very Best Professor! Dr. Woolard is a true college professor and she really cares about your grade and you!", "Monica in person outside of class she can be nice. In class another story. She is very rude, unreasonable, and she gives you the run around like she can't be bothered. If you have to take chem I suggest you take it at Camosun and transfer the credits. I have had to go over her head many times for my lab to be graded again for a proper mark.", "There are 5 essays you have to do throughout the semester. A few grammar tests. Classes finish early (woohoo!) She helps a lot during the process of writing the essay - just make sure you use her help in editing your drafts and what not. Not a tough grader, but you need to submit all essays. Grading is also very clear", "She is a very nice professor as long as you have good classroom etiquette. A lot of information is covered; you must read and study well. Expectations are clear and she will help you if you asked.

Very good learning environment she was one of my favorite teachers at UW-SP!", "Great professor! Very enthusiastic and cares about her students. She is so genuine and nice. I hate history so this class was boring for me but very easy. Her tests are easy if you go to the review. She tells you whats going to be on the test the class before the test.

Creates many opportunities for you to make extra credit.", "liked the number of graded assignments", "Shelly Hancock is one of my favorite instructors here at BCTC. She is so lively and passionate. He classes are almost never boring. Sometimes in her class, I felt as if my older sister was teaching me. She is just so friendly and fair. She gives you a hard time on essays, but that's because she cares about you. She wants you to become your best.", "Hardest but best English teacher I ever had. I whined along with everyone else when she graded us strictly but I'm so glad I took her class and I learned a ton from it", "Sherry Rising is a very good Instructor. She makes learning fun.", "I think she's a nice lady but she's not the best teacher. I took two of her courses so far and both of them were so slow and boring.", "I loved this class. Dr lape does give test but they're easy if you read the readings. I read half the readings and kept up on the weeklies she post which summarized each ready and writer. USE THE WEEKLIES FOR THE TEST!!!!! easy to pass if you can readwrite english.", "Dr. Slusher wouldn't accept a hand written love letter from Channing Tatum if it wasn't APA format. She is crazy for the rules and reads the PowerPoint word by word everyday (good luck dealing with her voice). Tests are common sense, but difficult because there are 3 right answers but you need to pick the 'best' one", "Horrible! very disorganized, all over the place. I got an A but because I learned the whole book on my own, I do not recommend her classes!!!", "Don't buy the book because she basically only grades you on what's discussed in class. Attendance isn't mandatory but in-class worksheets are random and count for a grade. I didn't like how few grades there were; the class was out of 100 points. She uses a lot of examples to make concepts clear.", "Love this professor! She's a little disorganized, but it's not too bad because she's super lenient on assignments and always very helpful. She's so passionate about the material, which really engages you. She is the type of professor you will remember years down the road when you look back at your education. Take this professor! You'll learn a lot.", "She is great it is best to take during the summer 6 weeks section and she only uses 4 weeks", "I love adele! she is great, i have had her for both research methods and senior seminar.

Always willing to sit down and have a chat, very caring individual :)", "soooooo niceeeee, take her during the summer she is a garenteed A", "I took her MASS COMM LAW class. Was it hard? Yes. It's a law class. She makes the information so acessible and loves to engage the students in discussion. It doesn't help when half of the kids in class don't pay attention then complain about their grades. We're adults. Show up and study hard! She did a great job and miss taking her class.", "She's the best professor I've had at Clark. She's very smart, passionate about what she teaches, and very approachable. I read other comments, and it's as if they had a different professor. Go figure. The one I had was absolutely wonderful.", "Very unclear about what she wants. You never know your grade until the very end. Comments on the rough drafts never make sense (she doesnt actually read them) and tries to make her students opinions fit hers in the pointless and frustrating 'class chat'.

Will answer all your questions. Easy grader.

Jackson-Jones is the professor everybody wants. She is always on point, very knowledgeable, understanding, charismatic, and interesting teacher.

RESPECT", "Bad Class, final study guide is more than 40 pages, books are dull. If you have no interest in race gender or media DONT TAKE.", "She's weird, but in a good way. You'll read a lot in her capstone, but it's a very inviting and pleasant atmosphere.

Liked the paper of my work even though it is not criminal justice. Take her", "I took her class for the SYRCE Art History class. Her class is very easy and she makes Art History kinda interesting.

I would recommend taking this class! No textbook required.", "She is clearly over her head and has no idea what she doing. She talks to hear herself be friendly, has no true industry in-site that does not come out of a book. She plays favorites, and is straight up two faced.

The class was easy, but there was a lot of assignments. As long as you do all the assignments on time and always show up to class you will pass.

I liked the class, just not her.", "These pre-nursing classes were the reason I decided nursing was not for me. Your grade is dependent almost entirely on 2 exams and a final.

You get to use a sheet of notes on the midterms& finals. Overall, not a bad professor but not a great one.", "I would recommend her. Easy class and she is very helpful. I learned a lot in this class. She offers practice quizzes and extra credit and should be an easy class to pass. It requires a SAM 2010 program disc that is $50 besides the books, also.", "she's a good professor. very engaging & her teaching style helps keep students interested. the course could have been organized better.", "Great professor. Made it easy to comprehend in class and made great use of electronic notes.", "I took Prof. Gilson because I read her Rate My Professor reviews and they seemed good. I hard a very hard time in her class, that I ended up dropping her class 8 weeks into the semester. I missed 1 class and she would not give me any notes or tell me what we discussed. She only grades based on exams and participation.", "She is really willing to work with anybody to get the grade that you want. She is the most understanding prof I have ever met. She will do anything you need to succeed in her class. Such a nice and kind human being.", "All of the gaming classes she teaches and the 3D modeling class are boring. She doesn't actually teach. You either do nothing, work on projects, or watch videos that teach. If you are working on projects it is pointless because you have plenty of out of class time to get them done.", "Has lots of experience.Very approachable. In this field we need a caring side for patients and not just Porfessor side. They both work together. She has it!", "Great professor, you can write about really whatever you want in the papers. She's very open minded.", "Excellent prof", "Make sure to go to class and write down how to do her problems!! If you go to her office hours she tries so hard to help you, even though sometimes her explanations arent the best. You can easily get a B even if you fail the final...", "No Comments", "She creates an atmosphere of awareness and motivation.", "Super sweet lady but be prepared! Her slides are not posted on blackboard, nothing is, and the slides are really the entire book put on power point. If pressured for time. She gives a study guide for the exams but its just as long as her power points. She is very mum on what to expect for exams. I feel Im going in to it exams blind.", "Amazing professor! While attendance is not mandatory, there is usually an assignment of some sort(hw, quiz etc.) that is due every class that can not be made up. Very fair. Be prepared to earn your grade.", "she sucks...she fails u on a test NOT BECAUSE THEY ANSWERS ARE WRONG but because u didnt put the equal signs in the right spot..freakin ****", "Julie was great! class was easy and she kept it interesting. Text was a waste of money though because she explains everything!", "HORRIBLE CLASS! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!", "Epic.", "Collins taught two of my core classes (Ad and Soc./Media Crit.) and was enthusiastic and extremely knowledgeable of the subject in both; some longer assignments provided a chance to document and research historical advertising materials, others included semiotic readings of various media.

Homework took HOURS with unclear directions. We spent weeks going over something that wasn't tested. The midterm, final, and homework were all different. She made her TA review the final during class time even though the TA hadn't seen the final yet. Could go on and on. AVOID!!", "She is very nice with everybody. I like her, she is understendable.", "Quite possibly one of the WORST at EKU. She shows favoritism, biasness, and her personal opinion is easily swayed in either direction by gossip and the opinion du jour. She cares little for her classes and her students. I've worked with her ESL students and watched their scores FALL as a result of her program. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES!!", "No Comments", "Definitely not my favorite prof. Learned more/better on mathlab then in class, because Im not too good at math and her teaching style wasn't good to me. if your already good youll do well but if not make sure you teach and prepare yourself and study in groups. lots of homework online before test, 4 tests and she gives lots of extra credit. STUDY!!!", "I have never had a professor care as much as Dr. Sweely. She genuinely cares about her students. You have to take her as a teacher!", "Julia is a very smart professor who knows what she's talking about. However, she doesn't know how to explain concepts properly especially for harder accounting classes (AFA). She goes really quickly through the course materials which leads you to major confusion and she doesn't really show you how to write good cases, but expects you to be good", "The information I have learned is unbelievable. I take classes and get tested and forget the information. But Mrs. B relates the theory to actual teaching practices - and I understand the picture.", "RUN AWAY!!! Even though I was warned about her horrid teaching skills I still took the class thinking I could pass by learning independently or with a tutor... I was sooo wrong! Don't take stats with Judy! Her philosophy on teaching is students read the text book three times and don't ask questions. Worst teacher I have ever had! EVER!", "She lectures. You take notes. What's in the notes is hardly ever on the test. If you don't want to have to read every single chapter, don't sign up for her class.", "great professor. quick grader ... wants all of her students to well. explains things well and makes sure all her students understand. gives out her home phone number in case you ever have questions later that night. AWESOME CLASS AND PROFESSOR", "Prof. Dearing isn't a bad teacher. Things to note about her class: 6 absences bring you down a letter grade. Being late by 10 minutes 4 times counts as an absence. The final paper isn't accepted late, not even later that day. She teaches grammar and essay structure. If you want to read poems and analyze symbolism, this isn't the class for you.", "she was a great teacher and would help anyone on her own time.", "This teacher is an attendance nazi! After 1 missed class, or 1 late arrival, or 1 early departure, you start losing 5-10 points off the final grade! She is horrible at lecturing and doesn't seem like she has much knowledge of the material, she skims the surface. Take someone else!", "love the accent....hard readings that you must do to be pepared EVERYDAY for a quiz...", "IF YOU: SLEEP IN CLASS, DONT PARTICIPATE IN CLASS DISCUSSIONS,DONT LIKE TO READ,AND LIKE TO LEAVE EARLY..PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DONT TAKE HER CLASS! BUT SHE IS GREAT!", "She is one of the best dance teachers I have ever had. Very clear and very helpful.", "I loved Dr. Grabe's telecom class. She really knows all of her stuff and I found her lectures interesting and at times very enjoyable. She uses a lot of examples and often asks for people to participate and I often felt bad because hardly anyone beyond the same few would participate. She's really cheerful and has a great sense of humor!", "Very nice, helpful and understanding teacher. Midterm was hard, but final and the overall course was easy. Highly Recommended!", "What a nice person! She is very approachable and her lecture material is clear. I would definately recommend any class with her.", "she's ok. She lets to the TA do everything, so it really depends on the TA you have as to wether you like it or not. Basically show up and you'll do ok!", "She's freaking awesome!! She's super enthusiastic, so there's never a dull moment. She seems to really care about her students. I really enjoy her class and would recommend her to anyone.", "Awesome lady, so much fun. Everyone should join!", "DON'T take Teague. Especially at 8am and it being your first college class ever. She seriously must thing that her class is the only one we have because she piles on the homework.", "Stay away from her. Neither does she knew the theory nor does she teach well. I do not recommend her class at all.", "3rd time taking this, others I made D's if you don't understand she takes time & patiently walks you through it. HW/quizzes can be retaken until you get a grade you're happy with. At the end of the semester if you aren't happy with one of your test grades, retake it, if you are happy with all grades you don't have to go to class the last few days.", "BEST TEACHER. You do not need the book (if there even is one) She gives you handouts does great examples. Study ALL of your notes and you will do find. Tests are short answer/problems. She def. Knows her stuff. Even If you failed her class you would want to take her again. She is great!!!!", "Chase is such a nice Professor. She loves Physics. There's many old Exams floating around which aids studying. Her exams are not difficult, per se, but one must prepare a lot buy keeping up w/ trying problems over and over. Chase passed me w/ a \"D\"after I averaged a 45.5% w/ the Final. Lab counts as a test grade too and I think I got 85%. Roughly a ~55% avg. got me a passing grade. I was a senior and went to talk to her though. ??", "Well prety much the content of the was was not important and was not part of a real english class.

Prof. P stands for Pathetic and Positively ghastly. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. She has no substance and you don't learn a single thing in this class.", "An informative and invested teacher.", "Great teacher. NOT a push over by far. Do her HW, attend class, do her reviews, and you WILL do well. Rare teacher that cares about her students. relays information in a clear simplistic format. AWESOME TEACHER!", "the assignments were very easy but assigned very randomly. almost no notice for our final essay! just a few days before it was due. it wasn't on the syllabus. a nice person, but very forgetful and vague. student discussion made up 90% of class content. would not take again.", "Professor Siegfried believes that her students are capable and intelligent, so she pushes your limits more than any professor I've ever had. However, the work is worth it; taking two classes from Professor Siegfried (Shakespeare and Film and Feminist Literary Theory) have challenged and changed my world view. Every ounce of work is worth it.", "Love this lady!!!! If your not a good writer ,like me, she explains everything well. It also helps you when writing papers for other classes.", "I am currently taking her class and she does rush through the material. She is late sometimes. The tests are graded strictly. She doesn't review before tests because students do not feel they can ask questions. My advice is to seek tutoring. However you can take the departmental exam to opt out repeating which is what I might due.", "No Comments", "Teacher was extremely unhelpful, awful at grading assignments, and all the quizzes were poorly done. If you can help it do not take this teacher, it will almost be next to impossible to get an A!", "She thinks she's a good professor but her lectures are utterly pointless. She's confusing and goes off on tangents that are irrelevant to the class material. I would probably look for a different professor in retrospect because, although I received an A, it was a stressful 100 level class and I learned nothing.", "Great class. All you have to do is show up and pay attention (make sure you get the right notecards). I went to a performing arts school in middle school so I already knew most of the things but she does explain things really well and she is willing to help if you dont. The class was with about 200 other kids so go to her office hours, if need be.", "Class turned out to be way better than I expected. There were tough assignments/papers but she is such a nice lady and is ALWAYS willing to help out students. I am definitely taking her again for Psyc 202!", "Very easy and fun class. It's easy to get an A in the class and she keeps things interesting like having salsa dancing lessons. One of my nicest teachers.", "Wonderful professor. Certainly cares about her students, and does anything she can to help them learn and grow- as long as they are willing to put forth the effort. This class will better you as a dancer and a performer, and you will learn more than you anticipated, I'm sure. You won't regret taking a class with Gel! She's great :)", "GREAT PROFESSOR! I love this class. She sso helpful and teaches in an interesting way. The test and quiz was challenging but it was all good! Study cause you will need to know your stuff! VEry fun class.", "She is the BEST :)", "Although she may be intimidating, I can honestly say I learned more from her than any other professor. If you're lazy then search elsewhere. Sue is a lively force, she pushes you to produce your best work, and gives you the education every student should hope for. Definitely a professor dedicated to her students and their educational well being.", "No Comments", "Great prof. Really knows what she is doing. Teaches well. If you don't do the work and mess around however, watch out. Her bad side is not cool. Gets sidetracked at times but her way of looking at life is interesting and very funny. She doesn't assign that much work so just do it when you get it. And read the txt bk.", "WoW! I recomend everyone take a class with him, for the experiance alone. Its amazing that they let this guy teach at a university. SCSU is a joke for keeping this guy. I asked a question in class and he reponded \"did you read the book 10 times\"", "Professor Douglas didn't grade assignments in a timely fashion so you were always left wondering and she didn't give comments as to why she didn't give you the full amount of points. You have to read and memorize the chapters if you want to pass the quizzes and these are 50+ page chapters! All in all I would not recommend taking her class.", "Dr. Townsend is great. She's an actual educatator. You have to read. You have to write well. You can't get away with sloppy work. She holds students to a professional standard. That's my tuition dollars at work. I'm not interested in an easy A.", "She not as bad as everyone says. She is strict, but the class isn't that hard. You have to read the book, but the lectures aren't bad. You do have to show up for class bc she gives quizzes and participation pts. Her tests aren't too bad, she just uses sophisticated wording. So as long as you can decode the wording, the test is really not bad.", "How Dr. Dogru taught was very frustrating. She was hard to understand at times due to her accent and her somewhat poor English made newly explained concepts more confusing. Got a good grade but had to spend a lot of time figuring out concepts on my own. She marks things wrong but doesnt explain why. Extremely nice lady, not a good 227 professor.", "Whip-smart and clearly an expert in her field (19th century British lit.). Doesn't take any bull. Highly respected at McGill. Go to her office hours.", "Nice lady, interesting and knowledgable, and likes her students. But VERY BAD at breaking things down so that they are clear for the students. Wanders off topic all the time. Many times will put her opinions and interpretations forward as the things we should learn, rather than discussing and focusing on the ideas from the class readings.", "No Comments", "Where do I start? Feth is awful. Grouchy. Rude. Boring. She disrespected everyone in our class and made us all feel stupid. She was completely inappropriate at times. Don't bother asking questions. Or making light conversation. Good luck if you don't understand something. I didn't use the book at all. Just notes. Hardly went b/c she was so mean.", "No Comments", "Very helpful and engaged the students. Explains topics clearly and is easy to understand.", "really cool lady. the books are all good except beloved, hated it. classes on tuesdays and thursdays, juss be aware thursdays class is just re-reading what you already read and discussing it for 75 minutes, absolute boredom if u dont like the book, like beloved. Ive taken kap b4 and would again", "HORRIBLE, worst class I have ever taken and she is no help at all! Online for a reason and expects you to come to her office hours for help when you email and show exactly the problem is and just need a better clarification of it all and nothing no help! NOT RECOMMENDED", "I had her at ACC. Really nice. Fun. Class is mandatory (3 abs. allowed), but she's understanding if you need more. She won't GIVE you an A, but it's not hard to get one. I never bought the book, I just looked up the stories online. Definitely recommend her. It's 5 essays, a final essay, and some easy journal assignments. Take her if you can!", "A very nice lady, but difficult to understand and unclear about expectations. Our syllabus/calendar was useless and there is NO class participation required (something mandatory if you actually want to learn). Let's people misbehave like children. You can definitely phone-in this class but just try to be clear about the due dates because she isn't.", "She is not easily frustrated when students ask questions, but she usually explains things really well. Homework is due on test days. Tests are not very hard. She tries to make the lessons fun and interesting. She also gives advice on how to teach lessons in the classroom.

She really wants to see her students succeed", "she is not very hot at all and she likes black boots", "No Comments", "She's the best, really nice, helpful, and attentive to every student!", "Took ACC 202 over the summer online. Totally thought I was going to fail because I failed every test but the last one but I still got a C. If you do the online homework and study the notes its possible to do better. Apparently she said she curved the grades. Good thing.", "The class is really tough due to lack of introductory material. It jumps you right into the nitty gritty. Her tests are really hard but if you do well on the assignments and projects you are sure to get at least a B", "Nice person...Soc. of everyday life was real confusing and most of the time I had no clue what she was talking about in class. Would like to have her again, she tried her best.", "Cathy rocks! She cares about her students and whats he's teaching about. She even gives us her cell number in case we need her! how cool is that! She's deffinitly the BEST @ STU!", "She is way too kind hearted and gets taken advantage of. Most people don't sleep in her class because they don't come in the first place. Those that do get to see some decent movies. Overall I liked her even though many thought she was unclear at times.", "I didn't like this class. Lots of busy work and subjective grading.", "April is an awesome teacher.", "Well I found her class difficult, she was always out sick, and she wasn't very clear, and she ran class badly.", "Very bright, very insightful, very helpful woman. A fine advisor for final year projects or graduate studies. Very, very sweet.", "The best thing to do in this class is pick the little gems of knowledge out of the rest of the mental dustcloud that gets kicked up, and never settles. Extremely nice woman, a rockstar in France, but the material's difficult to grasp and the grading mostly random. Start Wikipediaing Lacan now if you want to understand, but your grade'll survive.", "This class was SO AWESOME! If you're trying to decide between professors, I would definitely choose her. She made us work hard, but she believed in our ability so I never felt like it was impossible. Her lectures were inspiring and I always learned something. What's really cool about her class is the applications it has to other areas of life.", "Cynthia is a really nice and knowledgeable lady. She doesn't use the book so I wouldn't waste your money. She is all over the place when it comes to when things are due or whats going on in the class in general. Shes really frustrating in regard to any type of class schedule and you have to remind her of things several times.", "Very good professor! She is very nice and has a lot of interesting information to share! :D", "Professor Malitsky was helpful with homework classes during lectures, but her lectures were verbatim from the textbook. So when I attended lectures, I did not need to read from the textbook. I did the minimum work for the class and scored the highest score on the final. The material isn't hard, but the teacher is a little boring. But, she is nice.", "One of my favorite teachers,. she is fun to be in class with and is very helpful with all the questions. I would defintely have her as a teacher again", "Oh my gosh...", "I REALLY ENJOY HER CLASS FROM AN OVERALL STANDPOINT...SHE IS REAL CLEAR AND SHE GIVES A LOT OF EXAMPLES WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THINGS.", "She isn't the most sympathetic professor, but it is so easy to pass the class. She offers so much extra credit and you can take the quizzes until you get 100% on them. Show up to class though because there are little in-class responses that add up to 150 points throughout the semester. You have to attend 2 concerts and write about them. Overall OK.", "She was easy if you know what you are doing. A good review for if you already know the stuff, test are easy and quizes are too. Homework sucks but is extra credit, attendace doesn't count neither does tardiness. She is confusing though!", "Had this Prof last fall. She is an excellent lecturer, however, evil in clinicals. Does not care about her students. Read every NCLEX book you can to study. Most people fail Test 3. Don't get upset over it. Just ace Test 1 or else you're operating on a deficit. Good luck!", "terrible. can't teach. Very confusing. I droppped her class", "Nancy is great! She is one of those professors that you either love her or hate her. You have to be open to constructive criticism and take her advice when she gives it to you. Go to her for resources!!! Not only will she see your trying but you'll get good grades. Nancy knows what she's talking about so take her seriously she can be a tough cookie", "I didn't sleep well before her class- she likes to make you feel stupid.", "Jennifer was a great teacher, she relies a lot on her TA but none the less is very clear and interesting. You don't need to buy the books just go to class and almost everything on exams is right out of class.", "You would be hard pressed to find anything negative about Dr. Sinning. You will learn more in this class than in any other class. She has been teaching at WMU for over 30 years, and instead of being lazy and reaping the benefits, she has only kept improving on the quality of teaching. Amazing professor. WMU is lucky to have her! Grading VERY FAIR.", "the best professor in the art dept. willing to help you, if you ask. is a difficult \"A\" but well worth the effort. i learned a great deal in her class.", "This woman is a terrible teacher. She teaches directly off of her powerpoints, but she doesn't even know the material. The first test is material from high school and is easy, but after that, I never made higher than a 55. The final is a state exam; super easy. I don't know how, but I made an A.", "Taking writing for the web with Dr. MCT and Ms. Joyce was the best idea ever! She's such a sweetheart. Very helpful and loves to hear your ideas. :-D", "okay so this was one of the most boring classes i have ever had. She has this monotonous voice that drains the life out of you. she simply reads off her notes and looks up once in a while. yes her exams are hard, but that's not the problem. it's the unstimulating lectures that kills the fun out of english class. dreadful class. AVOID.", "The worst teacher I've ever had, hands down. She doesnt start her lessons until 2 weeks into the semester, and she grades by how much she likes you. I made all A's and B's on the assignments/tests, and somehow I ended up with a C in the class -_- Don't expect to gain anything from this class. How does this woman have a job?", "Incredible teacher of post-colonial literary criticism!", "Great professor, she will really help you out with essays if you go to her office hours", "I didn't dislike Professor Browne as a person, but as a teacher she is very difficult to follow along with. If you have trouble in math, I would not recommend taking her class. Too much lecture, without the in class practice. If for some reason you do take her, talk to her one-on-one, because she is willing to help you.", "Really Cool", "Professor Zacate is the type of professor where her instructions are pretty vague, so you need to make sure to ask as many questions as you need to, to get things cleared up. She gives out a lot of writing assignments which work towards the ten paged paper at the end of the semester for extra credit. She also doesn't explain the chapters often.", "Whoever said that she doesnt give extra credit must have been in the wrong class. I got a D on the 1st test and still got an EASY A. There was the chance for over 35 extra EASY points troughout the semester. She is hilarious, and will say just about ANYTHING. I would definitely recommend taking her.", "She was such a sweet instructor! I loved her classes! She was always so happy to see you in class! She brought out better writing skills from me. Pam was a good natured woman with a heart of gold!", "AMAZING I LOVED MY INTRO TO SOCIAL WELFARE. SHE IS AN AMAZING PROFESSOR!!! : )", "Great teacher. Do the work and you will get an A. Slack off and you will fail, just like any other class.", "Super great teacher and knows what she's talking about and super nice when it comes to asking for help. She is always is there to help when I had questions and was the nicest person to help you understand! I did take the hybrid class and yes the class went super fast and its a lot of work and studying but she goes over the whole test most it helps!", "Dr. Reynolds was a peculiar teacher that did not really lecture much at all after the first few weeks of the semester. Her essays were not too difficult but she did not really help explain how to go on about writing them. It felt like a self study course with class visits just to turn in the assignments. I ended up with a B in the class.", "No Comments", "She assumes you already know everything, therefore her teaching skills SUCK", "I loved her. I have to agree with the person below me though, she can be pretty rude at times. Class was a lot of fun!!", "Pretty easy class as long as you actually put some thought into the essays and reports. EXTREMELY nice and helpful professor. Attendance is not \"mandatory\" however she did take attendance daily. Lectures could be pretty boring, but they're helpful when you don't understand the material. All the lectures consisted of her explaining the reading.", "No Comments", "She's really funny, but we don't get much done in class. Memorize lecture notes and google keywords for essay fluffing. As a person, she feels and believes-- heart on her sleeve sort. Very approachable, sorta boyish and grumpy but she smiles.", "At first when attending class it seemed like it would be a ton of work. This turned out to be one of the best classes I've ever taken. She works with students and the students present on the theories in class. It's a great way to learn, we did activities and got to know everyone in the class. Honestly, one of the best professors I've ever had!", "This is a hybrid class, she will e-mail you within 2 days of you sending it.Tests are multiply choice and given at the beginning of class and then you will take the lab quiz. The reference materials are too numberous making it difficult to gauge what might be on the test. Absorb as much as you can or be sorry on test day.", "The best professor I have ever had! Recommend that anybody take a class with her if possible!!!", "One of the best professors I've ever had! She's definitely not easy, but you'll learn a lot if you do the work.", "Professor Espa\u00c3\u00b1a is great! Im terrible in math and passed the class with decent grade. If you participate in class she gives extra points on the tests. 4 tests 1 cumulative test if you havent done good on the others. Easy class. Highly reccomend.", "The content covered is very interesting, but the way that she tests you over it is not. Instead of testing over the themes of literature and the impact they had on history, you are expected to be able to identify direct quotes. There were only 4-5 grades for the whole semester and one of those was a group project.", "she is very very hot and every once in a while i have to tell fred to calm down if you know what i mean!!!", "Please, do yourself a favor and do not take this class. Over half the class has complained to the university, they do nothing because the man is on tenure. By far the worst professor in CT, perhaps the US. I am passing along with a few others only because we've taken acc classes before. He spends 90% of class telling stories. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!", "Dr. Chen is great. She really tries to help you understand this material. She's also available outside of class for extra help. Her tests can be complicated, but if you study, you'll be fine. She's a great prof and I'm looking forward to future classes with her.", "Was open about her own opinions so we could start off an honest class discussion as equals.

I learned more about history in one semester than in all my other years of school combined. They should talk her into teaching the presidency part of poli-sci.", "Maria was the sweetest professor I have ever had. She was super flexible and understands that life happens sometimes. Sometimes was not super clear about criteria. But was fairly assessable outside of the classroom.

Don't take her class!!", "Nodine is was she is. If you are willing to advance yourself she is willing to help you do it. She loves what she does and does what she loves.

Pretty straight forward, and you do have to do the reading if you want to do well on the the written portions of the quizzes. There is one long paper that's do by the end of the class, and I suggest you do not procrastinate on it like I did. It takes a long time.", "What a wonderful lady! VERY EXCITED to teach and be there, which is sometimes hard to find with professors these days. Cares about her students doing well and will help at any cost.", "Without a doubt the best prof I've had at University. Yes, there's a lot to read, but it's typical third year reading load, so I wouldn't complain. Her lectures were insightful, informal and a lot of fun. She's great to talk to about the course material during office hours, even if you understand it already. I wish I could take the course again.", "She a little droopy. But she is fun if you give her a chance.

The assignments can be long and overwhelming but like I said if you do the work you will get an A. The assignments can be done very loosely, just writ to fill up space, to her its quantity over quality. You can get an A easy!", "TERRIBLE! I was overjoyed to get a B since I could barely stay awake the whole semester. Class consisted of 28-slide power points since the professor liked hearing herself talk. No class discussion.

DON'T TAKE HER!!", "No Comments", "Amazing professor that she explain very well and spend whole class time that mean she don't want to waste any minute.", "She gets confused while teaching. I wish i dropped the class.", "God, I love her. Tests are very open-ended and she assigns mini tests before class to give you the main points of the reading.

Awesome grading system, easy A, very helpful.", "Very pretty.. hard to concentrate.. good teacher", "She is the worst professor that I've ever had at PCC. She can't even answer your questions. All she does is copy the textbook on the board... Her lecture is EXTREMELY BORING. Avoid her if possible.", "Ms. Maguire was great. I took Intro and she explained the material well.

Overall, a good teacher but tends to be confusing sometimes.", "I dreaded speech class and Laura made it fun.

Part of our grade is visiting her during her office hours. She said that if we don't have any ?'s that we still needed to show up to say Hi.

More papers than English class.", "Lectures are always interesting and well organized. Likes class participation but it doesn't guarantee you a good grade.

Her grading scale is tougher than most, an \"A\" is 95 % and above.", "She is wonderfully helpful. The book is def needed, although it isnt used all the time.

U have to do her HW (She dont play that) but if u do its a recipe for success. Just attend class, do HW, ask ?'s, and do her reviews and you WILL do very well in her class.

The rest of the course pretty easy, just be outgoing and fun and you'll get an A.", "Ms. Hampton is perhaps the only teacher that challenged me to my utmost ability at GPC.

She is very funny and always talks about her kids. SHe's a great professor.", "It's a lit class so there is obviously a lot of reading. Dr. Lape does a great job of explaining things. She is very easy to get along with. Participation in discussion is required but she welcomes all thoughts and does not put anybody down. She is also funny which makes literature not so boring. Would take another class by her again.", "Horrible teacher. Sucked really bad.I failed and was only two points away. She crams to much info. in at one time.

After that it becomes easy to speak in front of the rest of the class.", "Well, she's and interesting woman for sure! I took this class at the pinnacle of my first relationship. I came to love women and myself as a woman. I know I became more powerful inside myself, and I learned to love others more fully. My one qualm, the class is a little doomsday/end-of-the-world-ish. I say take it, but keep in mind, humanity is okay", "she is very engaging and caring professor. She has profound knowledge about C.elegans and embryo development.

DO NOT BE AFRAID OF STATS!!!", "Deb is just flaky, more so than other teachers. She likes poetic explanations but mostly her own, and it is tough to convince her of other ideas. One day we had a tea party for the entire morning. However, she actually does pay attention to the level of craftsmanship and will reward effort more than you think, gets REALLY pissed when kids slack off", "Nice lady. quite a bit of reading assignments and quizzes but the quizzes aren't really on the text in the book, but on the short stories that you try to skip over. she gives a lot of writing assignments and is a tough grader. you'll do fine if you go to class, read the short stories, and write your papers well before they are due!", "all around horrible experience. she's bland, boring, rude and disinterested in her students. she does not care about anything outside of her class. an 89.9 is a B, she doesnt accept late work for any reason, 10 points out of hundreds is max extra credit. she's grouchy, mean and not a good teacher! and she finds the most obscure info for tests!", "Best english professor at UCBA. Very helpful and provides good feedback with all of the papers. Total of three papers and a reflection letter.", "I'm taking her class right now and to be honest one word to describe her is UNORGANIZED!

Hands out way too many papers, and does not explain them.", "In response to a previous rating.

You pick one.", "Reaquires too much writing for a 101 class that is not even a writing intensive class.", "Convince a classmate to take notes for your and then show up for test days. You will do fine. Tedious note-giver, this class is common sense - learn the vocab and you'll do fine.", "Ms. E, as she is likely to have you call her, is a teacher that embodies what, in my opinion, is the pinnacle of teaching.

Take her only if you desire to be challenged and grow.", "She was a great lecturer and engaging, particularly considering it is a large lecture environment.", "Dr. White is an incredible professor. Two years into my PR career, I still quote things she said in my class. She's tough but fair. Despite it's appearance, PR is very difficult field. Her class is a good test on whether you'll succeed.

At first she seemed harsh but I came to see she is actually a really good professor.", "DO NOT TAKE! She is the worst professor I've ever had at RIC. Western Lit is a required Gen Ed course, and she gears it towards English Majors. Very rude, and does not care about the students at all. Requires you to buy about 14 novels, and you go through about one every week. Grading is based on her opinion of you. AWFUL!!", "THE WORST AND MOST LAZY TEACHER EVER!REPORT HER WITH THE DEAN, IT IS NOT FAIR TO HAVE TEACHERS LIKE HER.She canceled more than half of the classes,does not check drafts, classmates do.The final is really a draft that you send by email.She replies telling you something general about your mistakes,not helpful.I wonder if she really reads the essays.", "she is nice teacher. I like her treat people very equal.", "This teacher is usless if you are trying to learn. She is very smart i giver her that, but as a teacher useless. Her lectures were nothing to do with the test MOST of the time, the notes she handed out were very confusing and useless, you NEVER knew what was going to be on the test. basically she just is not \"teacher\" material.", "This professor doesn't teach how to use materials. I recommend watching youtube videos to master materials because one will not learn technique from the professor. She gives a lot of pointless lectures too.

Overall, I recommend you don't take her and just leave her class now.", "I just love her. She is SO helpful & understanding. I hate math, and she tries so hard to make sure you understand everything. She takes her time and puts math on a level that you understand. I cant say enough great things about her :) TAKE HER CLASS !!!", "WORST TEACHER", "Professor Herbert is by far my favorite professor I have ever had (online or in a classroom).

One day she is happy, and the next she is not. She seems like she does not like her job very much. She told me to come and ask for help, but then asked me to leave her office and not to come to class that day.", "YES, she is tough and requires way more work than any other teacher I have ever known but I understand why she is doing it. It doesn't mean I'm not going to keep complaining about 2 hr tests squeezed into an hr 15 min class. She is disorganized and cluttered which adds to the confusion but if you learn how she is you will depend on yourself more!", "No Comments", "Incredible teacher, has a great sense of humor, and a true sense to ensure her students are learning material.

Amazing!!", "nice, but shows favoritism", "Shaw only receives good ratings because mostly everyone taking her are ARTH majors themselves, with a real passion for the subject-- quality of professor be damned.

I wouldn't take her unless you have to.", "shes a pretty good teacher. a little boring but easy and she tries so hard to be funny...", "Mrs. Lair turned out to be a great teacher.

I got a problem wrong on my hw simply because I didnt put a dash in my z, so she argued that it was a 2!

Go to her office hours before exams, she'll use problems right from the exam to help teach you.", "The personality class was great. It's not hard if you do the work. The study guides make it so you know what's expected for the test. She's clear about what she wants. The presentations you have a lot of freedom on, which I liked, as with the final paper. It's not vague, you just have a lot of options. She's very helpful, lends books, and is nice!", "Very hard teacher. I get straight A's in my previous math courses in college but could not learn from her. VERY picky. Should have dropped earlier to get a refund but I decided to stick it out. Dropped just before first test as I knew she couldn't teach me. Only concerned with getting through material, not how well she covers or explains it.", "She loves to teach.Great teaching method and care about her students a lot. She was born to be a great teacher and I'm happy that I've taken her class once...you won't regret it :)", "Very understanding and helpful.

She made the classroom enviornment so comfortable. I have NEVER looked forward to a class before I took this one... and I HATE public speaking. The final is what lowered my grade to a B.

VERY interesting class!!", "Dr. Lorden is a great professor; this is my 2nd time taking a class from her. She assigns a great deal of homework/reading/quizzes. Sumtimes she is unclear in her explanation of material, but she will do whatever it takes to help. All tests have the option of being retaken (tests are difficult b/c of her wording. Keep the 250W book u will need it!", "Don't take her unless you can teach yourself outside of class. she's a terrible teacer plus her monotone in 8am.. sigh.. not the best teacher.", "I hate this woman. She's too arrogant for her own good. And yes, Id liketo see her academic career go down one day. I just think she's dry and boring and makes a class that involves SOIL a blah course.", "Nice, easy to approach", "Has really great enthusiasm. Isn't boring, and relates topics to your own lives. Is always willing to help... The tests are pretty easy, and a lot of quizzes deal with just showing up to class. She also offers like 25 points of extra credit...which isn't really needed for people who show up.", "Dr. Prividera is my absolute favorite professor here! I'm even smiling as I type this! She's so helpful. Attendance is a must because she doesn't place the powerpoints online. Take tedious notes and study everything and you're good! Ask questions about the study guides if unclear-- it pays off later.", "She is an amazing professor. She is so enthusiastic and really cares about her students. I loved getting up every morning and going to class. I recommend trying to go to every class because she moves quickly which is the only bad thing. If you miss one day it is possible you could be a little lost but she is extremely helpful.", "It's true she does expect you to be a newswriter at the start of class. She doesn't really teach you anything and then when you ask for help she tells you to look it up! Be prepared to write in your book and bring it everyday to class! She is nice though.", "Very easy.Love the stories.Other books are very easy.Testa are essay but isnt hard because she lets u pick questions the class before the test.Love her class.Class discussions are good but gives very very easy pop quiz if no one reads.", "Very invested in her students. Will do anything to help them succeed!", "Best professor in the Menifee campus. Very easy and fun class coming from someone who used to hate english. I took her for 92 and 101 and now I am her SI leader (class tutor). I highly recommend this class. You can get an easy A if you keep up with the work. Wonderful person.", "Great teacher. Very helpful. Genuinely wants students to succeed not only in class, but also in life.", "No Comments", "There is no question she would not do anything to help her students. But she does not know how to teach. She spends most of the class going off on her soap box about stuff that has nothing to do with the course. Than she will not allow a break and makes you do all her test in the testing center on your time. Don't take her for Chef 1305/HAMG 1321", "Very easy take this class. allows \"one week grace period\" for all assignments except the play review. lets you out a few minutes early for every class. take this class to fill your fine arts requirement. this class is a joke..", "she is very helpful and her assignments are clear. If you do your work you will have no problem.", "i've had her for a few classes, and a few portfolio reviews. she's no ****, no frills, and will tell you straight up what's good and what's crap. i think she's my favourite professor in the department thus far.", "Not a good teacher. She gives out a lot of reading assignments and they take at least 3 hours to do and at the end they are only worth 5 pts and she is always deducting pts for stupid reasons. She was also absent a lot and her CV's and personal statements are a waste of time. She is not a patient person and she is just not worth the time of day.", "Tests are extremely hard!! She knows her stuff!!", "her lecture is really boring, she use a lot of boring video, long long time ago information. she offer a lot extra credit, if you did them you will get a good grade. it is hard to learning something through her lecture.", "Be prepared to fight for mediocrity unless you are on her good side. I took this class after I took editing, so I knew a fair amount about AP Style and News, but she refuses to give good grades. If you are a comms major who likes to kiss up, you might do well. English majors beware. Would not recommend at all. No help, extra effort does not matter.", "Dr. Brown is a fantastic teacher who has a true passion for teaching. She truly cares about her students and is willing to do anything to help them succeed. Her funny and great personality makes class fun and class is never boring. Ever. It's an easy A as long as you do well on your assignments and tests and show up for class.", "This by far one of the most knowledgeable professors WMU has. Her class was tough and she makes you work for it but if you go to class and actually study the in class notes you wrote (that is exactly what is on the exam BTW), you will pass and more importantly LEARN. Probably wont get an A though. DO NO BUY THE BOOK DO NOT BUY THE BOOK!", "Good instructor for baking and dining room service classes. Clear, knowledgeable, knows the material. Always willing to help you out. Will work with each and every student.", "I will NEVER take her EVER AGAIN. you guys say no text book is a plus, but with cognitive psychology you NEEEED a textbook and also the fact that she doesn't do actual power points with notes she expects u to read a bunch of articles. but heaven help you if you miss one day of reading. i will say she tries to make it fun as possible.", "I never heard a satisfactory syllogism or argument on any topic outside of her lectures and I still doubt that her phenomenology course would score very highly in the perception class over at psychology. I haven't been able to subscribe to this proff.'s big money course in advanced tautology, which is WAY too abstract for me to handle.", "Kristine is one of the worst professors I've had. Incredibly full of herself, and teaches her opinions like they're fact. She's also technologically illiterate and wastes time trying to figure out the simplest things. Tests have confusing questions and she expects us to teach ourselves the material outside of class. Avoid!", "Best teacher ever. Made math understanding", "SNORE. Explains assignments better after you get them back covered in red ped, but is definitely willing to accept revisions.", "I loved Linda! She was so fun. Even though there was a lot of homework she made it worth it because she would help you through it. We did a lot of group assignments and group talking. I would take her class again.", "Kathy is well aware most people dislike math and as a result makes great efforts to make this class as painless as possible. No textbook purchases are required too which is a huge bonus. Highly recommended.", "Think you're good at English? Is that what your last prof led you to believe? Dr. Seldon exists to prove you wrong. That only path to an A is to mimmick her own writing as well as possible. Drop the class if you like yourself.", "Lectures were horrible. Prefer reading the text than to keep up with her. She keeps us in class way over lecture time. C'mon, we have other classes to attend!! Not Very Good...", "Dr Williams is great. I had no desire to take a film class, but needed the fa credit. It turned out to be a good class. It was a summer class and it was a lot to cover, but it was surprisingly easy. Dr Williams was very friendly, personable, and helpful. If you can take her I would highly recommend you do so.", "Dr. Rose is a nice person who loves what she does, but she is not good at teaching a large class. She goes through slides too quickly, not caring if people are still writing. The stories she chooses are strange and the assignments are unclear. I wouldn't take another class taught by her.", "She is super sweet but her class is hard. There is a nest test (book) we had to do and it was really difficult to predict what questions would be on there, so you didn't know which point of the book to really pay attention to. But over all she's great, just make sure you do all the work assigned, including the study guide,", "Joan Krone is an interesting person. This is not to say that you should take her class. If you are planning on being a CS major, and have a background in programming, she can help you out. She, however, has no ability to grasp that not every student has the same knowledge coming into class.", "Dr. P is my favorite teacher at tech. took her for both virology and med & vet ent. Shes a great teacher and the classes arent too hard. take ok-ish notes and fill out the study guides she provides you for the exams and you'll easily get a B or A. another cool things is she never requires text books for any of her classes so shes a money saver", "work was easy in class, and ridiculously hard outside of it.", "Class is not too hard, but Carnes expects you to do the work and be prepared for class, no excuses!", "Quality teaching with an upbeat attitude! She's a winner!!", "She talks relentlessly and cuts no slack for anyone. She doesn't like to answer questions or clarify what she means on assignments. Her tests are hard and she seems really excited about her material too bad she completely kills the fun out of it", "Awesome professor. Fair, honest and down to earth.", "Great instructor", "Therese is a hard professor who expects a lot from her students, but is fair and supportive. Her lectures are well organized, engaging, and intelligent. She's a brillant woman who knows what she's teaching. She gives a lot of feed back on papers with helpful comments. I urge anyone to take a class from Therese before they graduate.", "Prof. Miller is a very intelligent professor. She really knows and has a passion for what she does. She also hopes that her students will become engaged and at least somewhat enjoy what they do. She's very helpful, and although she expects A LOT from her students, we are, afterall, in college aren't we? You learn a lot from her.", "Lets just say she is boring. All she does is sit at her desk and read off her notes. The class is based off of attendance, three tests, and two papers. It was so hard not to fall asleep in the class... if you have to take this class, save yourself and do NOT take her", "Poitless class. Learned absolutley nothing. attendance is a must dont miss 1 day or you will more then likely fail. otherwise class was xtreamly boring and her teaching style is dull.", "Great teacher but makes no apologies for anything that comes out of her mouth.If you are offended easily don't take her class. I would also not piss her off. Even though she is one that you can joke with, take her seriously when she begins to warn you. The whole class will feel her rath if angered.", "Extemely awesome teacher...completely unlike your typical professor", "I loved this class and look forward to talking another course with this professor in the future. She's an incredibly nice and understanding woman.", "No Comments", "Prof.Saunders helps you with your writing if you ask her. She takes a lot of\r time with your writing problems and you can learn if you keep at it.", "This is one of the most helpful Math teachers that I have ever had for a class! She goes out of her way to help you out and usually responds very quickly to emailed questions; even over the weekend. If Math is intimidating; this is the right teacher to help you learn and understand it!", "Professor Maguire is a smart and kind person. She goes above and beyond her everyday teaching responsibilities to make sure every student is successful during the semester. But she is not a pushover.", "The class itself was hard at first, then it got easier. Did not have a good experience with the teacher. She was very rude and not encouraging either. When time came for students to drop the class, she said, if anybody wants to drop let me know so I can get forms ready. She should be encouraging us to continue and help. Not drop it.", "She uses a lot of real world connections to help apply biology to non-majors. Overall, pretty interesting class. Tests are a little difficult, though.", "No Comments", "I took her class this spring. Even though her class was not really easy, if you study hard, it won't be problem to get good grade. SHe cares about her students a lot, and helps students how to study. She is a very good prof.", "She really knows what she is talking about, involves the whole class, and does it in a way that keeps the class interesting. She is one of the nicest teachers ever!", "Keehn is a very fun teacher and she really knows what she is doing and talking about. I had her for early literacy and she's so much fun. She made the class fun and we got to act like the kids we'd be teaching. She is an awesome professor!", "I enjoyed Dr. Tenger's personality. I hate talking in class so I didn't like that aspect of her classes but that is my own problem! Lit Crit was my favorite class with her - I think I really enjoyed the structure.", "No Comments", "I would recommend considering applying to UBC instead of UVic,. Their courses are much more balanced than Uvic which is more technical .. like a trades program.", "Dr. Wall is a great teacher and she's really nice. The Education 3040 project isn't difficult but it is time consuming. She provides plenty of class time to work on the project and is always willing to help.", "sweet woman...genuinly nice", "I felt that she didn't really help us out at all online. We essentially taught ourselves from the textbook. Then on top of that, she would make 25% of the test about things that weren't covered in the textbook. How are we supposed to know these things if we are teaching ourselves.", "really worked for that A :)", "No Comments", "Great teacher... Kindda strict, but very helpful. I recomend taking her classes!", "PROFESORA FELT ROCKS! She has been one of my favorite professors since my attendance at Sonoma. She really wants her students to learn the spanish language but also the latin american culture. I would most definitely suggest to take her class.", "Best person ever. She does get off topic but the things she talks about are so interesting. Even if everything you say is bull she will still listen and relate it to the class and make you feel smart. Once I thought a paper I wrote deserved an F and I ended up getting a 97.", "You quizzes was helpfull to me, your explainations were clear and easy to understand. And the testes were hard enough to challenge students, but not too hard. It was very interested to take your course.", "You will learn a lot and see life through a different perspective. It is an interesting class but it does require an open mind and maturity. So red or green pill?", "She is SO sweet but if you get on her bad side she can be really intense. She goes fast at times, but over all she is a good teacher. She REALLYYYY cares about her job and her students. She can seem kinda crazy if you don't appreciate her humor. WARNING - NEVER LEAVE CLASS BEFORE ITS OVER unless you get permission before class to do so.", "Dr. Miller is awesome, but her class is pretty hard. You won't understand all of the material from just the lectures/hw because it's so difficult. It's worth taking a half hour every other night to read the book - it's what I did and I came out with a B. Also, take advantage of her office hours. She explains things better 1 on 1.", "Overall she is a good teacher who covers everything that are on the final exams, a lot of the need to go to class is covered by the WileyPlus test and practice although as always it is advised that you do go as she will lecture using good examples and explanations.", "I don't know how she is getting all these great ratings..I got an A, but she is the most obnoxious professor I've ever had. Sweet as can be as a person, but all over the place. She is so hyper it really gets annoying after the first few classes.PSY 250, Lit review, was the biggest waste of time of my life.you have to do a million study write ups", "CM is great, she loves her studies and it shows. Class is always lively. She is tough on grading though so make the effort in your writings.", "Not as hard if you study her notes AND take notes on any keywords and points she makes during lectures. Just pay attention. I got extra points on all of my papers and projects and most of them were done last minute. However, she's so hard on attendance that missing 4 classes last semester dropped my grade a full letter, which was very frustrating.", "she's a sweet lady, knows her stuff. but boy is she tough. spend hours and hours writing an essay, go in and ask her about it, have friends read it and get a b-. that's crap. many people dont like her class and find it boring. only a passion for the subject area can get you through the readings.", "No Comments", "This professor is very knowledgeable and her tests in J210 were cake, but she was very rude to me and other students. She promotes class conflict and makes assignments more difficult than they need to be. Her personality is very abrasive.", "Awesome professor. Intelligent, lively, funny, enthusiastic. Do the readings or you will be screwed at the end of the semester. Be active in class. Ask questions if you need help. She's a hard grader and her tests are tough- if you pay attention in class and do assignments you'll be fine. One of my fave classes at IU", "She did a good job teaching the class. The midterms and final were not at all over what she taught in class. Also, I agree with the other people who said that if she disagrees with your topic she knocks your grade down. Don't expect an unbiased grade in this class. If you work hard you should get an A though!", "Tromp is one of those professors that I encourage EVERYONE, regardless of their major, to take before they graduate. She forced us to take a seemingly simple subject and wrap our minds around it in a way most students have never considered. Her classes are fun, stimulating, and generally unbiased. Do the work with pride and you'll do fine in class.", "Best Speech teacher there could probably be if you are dreading the course in any way. She's really helpful and she honestly cares about everyone. The class should be simple for anyone comfortable with public speaking, and it'll be helpful to those who are not:)", "Teacher is wonderful!!! Very enthusiastic about Dance.", "She's a good person but her teaching skills are not the best she will help you if you stay after class. It's very boring and she can barely hear. The tests are difficult but it's easy to get your grade up I had a D and the final brought me up to B with only 55 question right it was out of over 100 questions", "tough grader, she expects too much for an introduction class, lots of homework, no extra credit", "This is by far the worst instructor I have ever had. She takes for ever to grade assignments but yet she never takes the time to correct her typos. It's like she leaves them on purpose. Her tests are really hard and most of the things she tests you over are not in the book or lectures.", "Excessive work and a waste of time. Learned more from professors at CSN than from this woman. SUA, connect homework, networking events, and not enough time for exams. She comes to class smiling, but it's a smile welcoming you to hell. Also, get ready to spend money on class materials. NOT WORTH IT.", "She's a very nice teacher and I have a lot of the same views on life and the fine arts as she does. She may be really tough at times, but it's only because she wants to make you the best you possibly can be.", "Poor grammar for an English teacher. Confusing requirements for grading. Says discussion board is due by 5pm Saturday but also says Students who wait until the last minute to post may find their comments for the week will not reach me before the Board closes resulting in a zero for that week.", "She definitely grows on you if you stick with the class.. she's challenging but very worth it.", "Had for 1 and 2 as high school junior. Easy teacher and very enjoyable. NO BOOK!", "Elizabeth one of the best professors on this campus. I highly reccomend her freshman seminar course! Acting with her will teach you a lot about yourself. she knows lots about you from the first moment you walk in... stay on top of all of your work if you don't it will bite you in the butt later.", "The class is what it says it is, research methods. The material she teaches you is invaluable throughout the rest of your time as a history major. Although she is very tough when it comes to writing, she grades fairly and will help you no matter what the problem is. I believe the class is now HIS 290.", "I had Prof. Sussman for Intro. to Media Criticism. Her classes are very interesting and she knows what she's talking about. It's really easy to get a good grade in the class as long as you listen to what she has to say. The tests are a lot of writing, but she prepares you really well.", "Unprofessional. Talks down to students. Not helpful. Rude. Lecture material is NOT a good reflection of what will be on the exams. Students and clinical patients complained about her attitude, demeanor, and overall lack of professionalism.", "Fabulous professor. Brilliant woman. Great person.", "Great teacher! If you pay attention and come to class you will do fine! She's very understanding and always there to help! She will reward those who try and comes to class. Would defiantly take again!", "A course surveying 1000 years is not going to be easy but she knows her stuff. Take lecture notes, that's what tests are based on and read. Going to classes everyday is not unheard of, this class does require effort but you will be rewarded.", "STUDY!!!! STUDY!!!! STUDY!!!!! She expects you to know EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! Mrs. Maleki is GREAT!!!! I would 100 % take her over again if she taught another class. She makes you learn and understand. She's funny and down to earth. She'll write you up even if she likes you. She treats everyone the SAME when grading and while in clinical. 100% GREAT !", "Professor Sailors is great. All of her assignments are pretty easy and you can tell she knows the subject very well. Make sure to complete the assignments and do the discussion participation. The quizzes come straight from the book. Take her if she is available.", "Great teacher, great lecturer. You can tell she lives and breathes the material, which is pretty inspiring. Loved her class. Too bad she doesn't teach Political Theory on the regular.", "Hands down one of the best instructors I've come across in a long time. She goes above and beyond to help her students. Shes extremely nice. And her lectures really help explain difficult concepts and theories. Material is difficult if very little experience with theory, but instructor provides engaging discussion to help learn and apply theory.", "No Comments", "Professor Sheryl Gifford is an average instructor. She provides you with positive feedback and truly does care about how you end the semester, yet she is not the most organized. She is constantly pushing back dates when she is supposed to hand back final drafts and does not post grades on blackboard, so you basically have to calculate your grade.", "Don't take her unless you want to fail the class. She is not a good math professor at all. I wouldn't even give her 1 point but the website doesn't allow me to give her 0 point. DON'T TAKE HER.", "Looks very young, is a grad. student teacher. Gives us notes and relatively easy tests. Rushes through material a lot and gets flustered if she runs out of time. Tends to be picky about small details. Friendly in class, but not really one on one.", "she will help you learn a lot about writing. you need to be organized and do your work.", "Best professor ever! She is willing to help. If you follow her instructions, you can do great. I love her.", "very livid about students talking during class. She seems like an ignorant person.. I would not take her if I was you.", "Nice teacher", "She's good but I sometimes get bored. The midterm and final might be a bit hard.", "Her population class is extremely easy. There is no textbook just a couple readings that are easy to understand. There is a portfolio due at the end of the semester but that is extremely easy. And the best part is that she will drop your lowest test grade including the final!! And her exams are easy", "Excellent teacher! Very helpful. Extremely nice and funny. Has the best facial expressions! I loved coming to class EVERY night and can't wait for next semester. I would highly recommend her to anyone interested in Sign. You will love her class!", "She's young and spunky, a little chatty and a tough grader! Class is fun because she's so charismatic. She has lots of activities that make you comfortable speaking in front of the class so the \"big\" speeches aren't so intimidating.", "Not a big fan \"Sarah.\" She teaches nothing in class. I spent hours with the study guide and found i had wasted my time when i took the exam.", "I have mixed feelings about this class, not so much the professor. Eisberg is good. Nice lady, helpful. I am not a science person so I thought this would be a better option then bio or chem but this class was still difficult. 5 big hw assignments, tests are short but worth a lot of points and in depth. Professor good; class so-so.", "She is very demanding for an intro class.I am an A student and received a C,with no explanation except she basically did not like my essays and that is the majority of your grade on exams and projects.I went to every class and studied.She has her favorites.not to mention she is very annoying!NOT recamended unless you like to suck up to people!", "She really contradicts herself. You have to read the book before she teaches you or else you will get confused. She rambles about her study abroad trip a good 20% of most classes.", "Social Processes and the Environment", "She is AWESOME! she's funny and makes class entertaining by telling jokes and stories that relate and help us understand the subject. She made grammar FUN! not too many tests (multiple choice done on a scantron) and a paper or two. Definitely recommend taking her! She's like a spunky, young, funny version of my grandma!", "Great proffessor... I don't know what you slackers are talking about giving her negitive remarks... there need to be more like her", "She's very popular, and I've never understood why. I found her class tedious and her style annoying. She's also quite arrogant.", "She is the best professor I have had, yet.If you can get her go for it.", "She's hard to understand at first but after being in her class a couple of days you start to translate well. She's always really helpful if you ask! She just expects you to apply yourself. Calls on people in class and laughs when answers wrong. But she's funny and a good teacher.", "She's is very rude. Focus too much on irreverent things. Doesn't even teach, she just reads off the handouts. She'll call you out if you're chewing gum or eating food, which is very childish. If there's another teacher teaching this class, TAKE IT. Horrible teacher.", "Great professor. Easy grader. Always willing to help. A's are very easy to attain.", "Fun. Educational. Caring. Hands on. goes the extra mile.", "Listen to lectures. Do the homework. Read the book. She gives good feedback and will clarify any questions asked.", "Great teacher! Her online course was to the point, and she graded very fairly. This was my first online course I have ever taken and I got an A. I enjoyed having her as a teacher.", "I love Professor Laplaca. She's like a mother to her students. Extremely pleasant and genuinely wants you to succeed. The problem is that she gives you an extremely long time to finish each project which isn't how the real world is. Also, I've seen people with bad projects still manage to get A's because she's a very easy grader.", "No Comments", "I have taken a few of her classes. I also chose her as my senior seminar coach. She was very nice and helpful. As a teacher--she is a jem. She was always excited about the content and she made us feel the same way.", "She is very kind so it is really easy to talk to her about things that are unclear, she uses areas of her work to help explain certain topics better. Although it is easy to get an A in her class its just as easy to get an F if you dont show up or do the work.", "such a cute, nice lady! knows what she's doing and makes class really enjoyable. only one paper on pretty much anything music. also gave us christmas cards at the end of the semester. i love her!", "She was very hard on grading papers, she showed favoritism, and she was never any fun!!!", "The worst professor I've ever wasted my money on. I don't think the space is enough to write on her inefficiency of teaching.", "great professor helps with everything take her great with feed back amazing all around", "Sherry is an awesome professor!! She is really funny and helpful!", "O can't stand her as a teacher! She makes the stupidest corrections on papers when nothing needs to be corrected, and if you dont agree with her your grade is screwed. Her husband is better than her", "The class discussions in general are dull, uninspired, and hard to follow. The professor tries to be helpful decoding what we are learning and is a fair grader, but the class is just unbeareable and completely unenjoyable.", "Take her if you want an easy A and HAVE to take a language course. However if you are interested in learning french truley still take her because you want an easy A anyway you can get it right? But seriously if you want to learn french in her class you must really practice and persue it on your own because she is just a little too light for a true", "One of the top professors at Loyola. Made a subject I had no interest in at all fun and interesting. Challenged me to change my way of thinking, and was pretty successful in making me see other perspectives. Outstanding!", "Horrible", "She was horribly rude and mean to everyone in the class. I hated going to her class and often went home feeling like I wanted to cry. Her dealines are all over the place and she is less then helpful when asked a question (that is when she doesnt put you down) She told my whole class that we should drop out because we are going to make bad teachers", "Really pleasant lady. The class is interesting and it actually made me look more into internal audit. But the group project is a huge pain, especially if you're stuck with a bad group. Have the initiative to ask questions because the instructions are really vague. Do yourself a favor and team up with good students or it'll be a looooong semester.", "I respect her for her intelligence and her ability to teach, not for her looks.", "Doesnt know how to communicate to her students. Degrades her students by telling them they'll never make it in the health profession. Has no professor student interaction at all and refers to the book when questions are ask. Teaches to 1 sec of class.", "Took Dr. Knight for Creative Writing and was very pleased. The woman is absolutely hilarious. She was a nurse and a police officer before she was a professor, so her stories go from 0-100 real quick. You write 4 original pieces in various genres and you're done. 10/10 would recommend.", "Basically the boss in accounting department. might intimidate you at first, then you realized she just doesn't have time for non-sense and casual talking. her slides are informative but notes are strongly recommended because I found it a bit difficult to figure it out if I missed the class. GOOD LUCK!", "By far the most interesting and engaging English class, bordering on things like sociology and psychology. The coursework is NOT structured in the sense that there are criteria that must be met, rather you make your opinions anyway you see fit. This allows for a lot of creativity and fun. Even as a science major, I thoroughly enjoyed this professor", "She is very smart, but definately arrogant. She expected a lot, but we are college students, the one problem I had with her is after she read our papers her comments were very harsh and she made me feel so judged no matter what I was writing about", "No Comments", "Most instruction takes place with videos and through practical applications. She is always quick to respond to questions and willing to help.", "Good teacher. Grades fairly and gives many opportunities to students to do well. A little quirky but overall a good instructor. She likes lots of oral discussion and writing. Show up, participate in class and complete assignments. They will help on exams.", "Overall, she is a decent teacher but there are some problems. She is unclear about what she expects from assignments. Her grading system is harsh as she grades people as though they are professionals. Also, she tends to babble quite a bit and talks endlessly. However she is very nice and approachable and is willing to help when needed.", "She's really nice and makes an effort to get to know you. Her class is definitely challenging, but the benefits are great. I had an okay time in her class, it wasn't the best time but it wasn't horrific either.", "GREAT TEACHER! Very funny too~", "It's either her way or the highway. If it's her way you're fine and can be in her club. If you have a different oppinion, you'd better invest in body armor because you will be attacked. But in her defense, I don't think she's aware that she does it. Doesn't change the fact that she does.", "Dr. Keehn is the best UTSA has to offer. You will work hard in this class but it is well worth it. I will be a better teacher because of Dr. Keehn.", "Funny! Pam Hood loves making jokes to lighten up the learning atmosphere.", "Greta was very helpful! She can come on intimidating, but has sincere care and concern for her students. She is tough for our own good. I came away from the class wtih an A and am positive, that taking the course will be my reason for many A's to come. Don't let the other comments scare you.", "I did not care for her and I feel that she did not care for me or my ideas. Some people like her, but I bet she liked them as well. I never did anything to her to deserve a C in her esy class. I turned in everything and I was nearly always there for class. Just don't wast your time.", "Very knowledgable! I learned more from her in one semester than I learned in a couple of years in high school.", "She is awful, you will not understand anything from her lectures. You will only sleep.", "Good teacher, but if she doesn't like you, she'll let you know it. Doesn't put up with any bull, so don't give her any. She will also single out students which I am completely against. Tough grader. -Chior boy", "Awesome teacher. She made algebra bearable.", "No Comments", "Everyday I left with a migraine. HORRIBLE. Her voice makes me want to cringe. I can't believe I have to take more classes with her for the ECE major.", "Okay so i am going to start with the good things because this professor isn't a terrible person just really tough. She stops for questions students have. Her grading is really tough though. On tests she deducts many points for small mistakes even for handwriting. If math isn't your thing its going to be tough. Homework is worth almost nothing.", "I suggest reading the material ahead of time from the text (if you don't have it, they have it in the library which I used because textbooks are $$). Do the extra credit ALWAYS, that means come to class or else you will miss out. 1st day she'll pick on people to participate, don't let this scare you away!! She stops after around the 2nd week:)", "Get on her good side, she is full of connections", "Love Susan. She is so friendly and so energetic. If she's hard on you it is because she has your best interest at heart. She is very approachable if you have any issue with her or her marking. Such a wonderful teacher.", "why.. why.. why... are all the teachers in the art department insisted on making an easy intro to art class so freaking difficult??? You can't miss a day or you lose 10points off your final grade. You have to buy the expensive book, have to write papers, do quizzes and take test... Are you kidding me??????", "boring, boring, boring. avoid her at all costs she is a horrible prof. not clear on what her expectations are, boring boring boring...that is all", "She is the sweetest professor, she is kind of difficult but if you listen and study you will be fine.", "Amazing professor.

While she is lenient, she is also very unorganized.", "She is at UWM. I have taken her 3 non language classes Attendance is important in her class, tho with a valid reason you can miss some, you will have an assinment every week, a quiz in some classes every week and papers and exams. Its not an easy A but if you do the work, participate, you should get an A. She's an awesome teacher", "Awful", "Feth is the worst professor I've ever had. She refuses to use Blackboard so you have to constantly hound her if you want to know about your grades. She does treat you like you're stupid. The textbook for this course is useless. She uses old activities that are copied so many times they are not even legible. She is incredibly arrogant without reason", "She is hard and stubborn... I would choose any other professor other than her", "I loved her class. I was very engaged throughout the entire semester. The class format is very straight forward and she gives some extra credit. The gives review sessions before each test which are very helpful. I highly recommend her for any class.", "This class was one of the worst experiences in my life. I usually enjoy English classes, but this changed my whole idea of what English is supposed to be. I did not like this class at all!!!!!", "Mrs. Laidlaw was an extremely resourceful teacher considering she teaches a subject more people would rather die than have to perform. Take her once a week class, she tends to cancel some of them. The final speech was optional! Also a really fun and interesting person and makes speech worth your while and money. Fair grader and gives good criticism", "I think that she is great. No, really, you do some work, but hey, she helps you and it is possible to get a good grade....like I did.", "Final grade may be 50% participation but speaking in class is really not required. I spoke about 4 times, got A's on papers and got an A- in the course. I think as long as she recognizes that you are reading the texts and you are paying attention in class, you're good in her book. If you don't mind reading, take her!", "Judy's class was easy and interesting. Her class consisted of \"showing up and enjoy the movie\" then go home and write a discussion paragraph within your group members online. We only had to write couple papers during the entire semester (just explain what you think of it)No textbooks! Judy deserves some respect from her students!(some ppl were rude", "Dr. Condit is the worst online professor I've ever had at VCU. She took on a new chair role in the poli sci department, and very obviously can't handle that and teaching. We'll go 2+ weeks without hearing from her, and NEVER has anything up on time. Ne I understand she's busy, but being MIA from her students is completely unacceptable", "Is very qualified, but sometimes lets classes drag.", "Professor Campos is the sweetest, most easy professor I've had. I was nervous to take Spanish since I hadn't since HS. She makes the content easy, and really works with you if you miss anything but make sure to tell her ahead of time. Quizzes and exams are pretty easy as well. I would love to take her for Spanish II if she ever teaches it again.", "i hate her", "Dr. Farrer is by far the greatest professor at Cal. She is organized and clear which are great attributes to model to future teachers.

If you take a special interest in learning the material, she will take a special interest in helping you succeed. I look forward to having her in future classes.", "This Class is very easy. I recommend taking it during the summer sessions if you want to avoid the boring lectures. I took it during the summer and we didnt have to attend class very often, just did the the online tests and worksheets which are very book based and(also ask very personal health questions)and you'll Ace this class no problem as I did", "Sweet lady. Very positive. Loves astronomy! Moderately difficult course, but simple if you just show up and keep up with assignments.", "Having just completed my 13th RTC course, she is by far the worst instructor I've had. I would never take another course with her.", "I thought Yasmin was a great prof. The first day she specifically tells you the class will be boring, but it wasn't. She makes it interesting and has a good sense of humor. There were 5 exams total with no final and some compositions but they were all pretty easy and straightforward. If you go to class and pay attention you should get an A.", "good prof, explains very well and uses examples from the real world. tests are very fair and I did learn alot from the class. very good course to take in spring/summer.

The class work and homework comes off as easy but the test are on a whole new level.", "She's a really nice lady. However, there is lots of homework and it gets tiring to do. What we learn about I feel is kinda irrelevant so it makes it hard to listen in class and absorb the information.", "DO NOT TAKE.I switched into her class and not only is she a hardcore feminist that only gives women a chance, she is a really tough grader. She also doesn't care about her students (again, unless you're a woman passionate about feminism). Do NOT take her. She will have you rolling your eyes as she complains about male privilege.", "It would be nice if she stopped talking about her self and teach for a little while. How many times do we have to hear about how many awards she has won?", "She's gotten better now that she has hearing aides. She's a bit scatterbrained, though. She's nice, and you make alot of puppets, but you might not learn alot. She really likes Woody Allen.", "If you attend class everyday, you do you're homework, and come to her with your questions, the class will become alot eaisier. Math isn't hard, it's just a challenge. Ms. Nelson really knows what she's doing and she never gives an excuse for why she can't explain problems. Plus, she's cheerful (most times) by nature so that helps!!", "Did not have her for clinicals. As an educator she often stresses points that will not be on exams. Her exam (#3) is very difficult, not the material but the wording of the questions and answers.DO A LOT OF NCLEX and you will be fine. Try not to take her clinical group (wednesdays).", "omg worst prof I've ever had. She literally talks in riddles and there is so much reading and theyre difficult. She pins you into going to lecture cause participation is 30% and 3 other papers plus final. I literally can never follow her at all! AVOID!!!

( its hard to get in her class b/c it get filled quikly so hurry if you want her) strongly recommend her !", "She's easily my favorite professor, she's understanding and helpful and a relatively easy marker. Intro was hard, but past that she eases up and gets to know you quickly! I love all of her jewellery!", "Professor Thompson was a great section leader. She was able to control the direction of the class with leaders dialogue; when a guiding hand was needed it was offered, but most of the time we were on our own, discussionf the great works in the corriculum. to be fair, her thucydides lecture was not one of the best of the semester and some have peg", "If this was not my last semester, I would have dropped this class from day 1. Awful - lectures are dull, slides are a mess, tests do not match what she says to study for, uses obscure things from the book never addressed during class. If you can get around taking this class and this professor, do so.", "She speaks softly and does not teach what is on her tests. One time we spent days on one chapter and there was one question on the test about it. She picks favorites with students and does not do well with questions. If you ask her a question it turns into a argument .", "definitely an easy A the tests are essay exams and she give you the 5 questions a week before the exam. do them prior to the test and you will get a good grade she is an easy grader.", "Super wonderful!

It was the most work I've had in an online class but she grades very fair and if you do the work you should at the very least get a B. I got a pretty easy A and actually learned a lot.

She is a very nice and fair teacher.", "If you want easy A, she's not an option. but she's really an enthusiastic teacher and she knows what she's doing. There are a lot of homework and you're expected to turn them in but they're really helpful. She's quite generous in giving grades too and there are many extra credit opportunities!", "she was the worst teacher i've ever had. she would have a different personality every day. and she rarely or should i say hardly ever passes anyone! so if you take her GOOD LUCK and have fun", "Professor Most is the best. She is such a wonderful person in class as well as outside of class. She genuinely cares about her students, and that isn't something you see in a Professor very often. I highly recommend World Mythology, and I'm taking Multicult. Children's Lit just cuz she's the prof", "This woman is terrible. She won't return emails and she's not easy to talk to. I dropped the class. I haven't spoken to anyone who likes her.", "Attend her class or you won't know what you're doing. The notes she posted online (posted a day before the exam at that matter) does nothing to assist your studies. She does not explain her answers through her notes so you have to be in class that day to understand anything that is going on. Also very confusing during office hour.", "Professor Dameron wants you to succeed! You must do the work and put forth the effort. If you do what she asks, you will succeed! Great class and great professor!", "She is so wonderful. She helped me so much and I owe alot of my A's to her class!", "Professor Yarmish is tough!

She won't put you on the spot. Very helpful and good overall.", "Math 108-15", "The lab portion of Chem 101 is ran by Monica, pray that you do not have her as your TA. She is unkind and very very intimidating, you can not mess up or make a mistake if she is anywhere near by. Chem labs are marked very unfairly, because not all the TA's mark the same. Chem labs are extremely time consuming and misleading. GO TO HELP HOURS!!!", "I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR!I honestly wish i can take her again.She is amazingly insightful & knowledgeable about her work and has a passion to teach.She is no nonsense however, and you must respect her class or she will set you straight!That's what i loved about her the most.I've learned so much in and will view films differently from now on.", "AWESOME teacher all you gotta to do is talk in every class talk about the book make questions etc...only thing is that there is alot of books to buy read maybe as long as you know how to talk", "I took her at NYU. The class was incredibly interesting. The hw assignments were thorough, but really helped you understand the material. She knows what she's talking about and really wants the students to learn, and will explain things until everyone gets it. She allowed us to determine exam and essay formats and we made up our own final questions", "This professor should NOT be teaching at a community college.

Whatever you do DONT take her!", "What a horrible prof. She expects everyone to be news writers and does take in consideration other majors. She is extremely condescending and passive-aggresive.

BAD BAD BAD BAD.", "A great teacher and I recommend this teacher for anyone who is going to take astronomy.", "Dr. Lape is absolutely the best instructor I have ever had. I have had the pleasure of having her for a total of three classes. She is upbeat, informative,complimentary and always gives her students positive feedback. I took English 2276 on-line, a lot of reading and writing but well worth it. She prepares you for the professional world.", "Considering I'm terrible at public speaking, she was great at making me feel comfortable and giving me ideas on how to improve. More work= more practice= better knowledge of public speaking.", "Hard Class. Lots of reading!!! BORING LIT TOO!!!

I highly recommend her!", "gives a lot of tedious homework. pretty good otherwise", "Her class is hard, you must do homework, & show-up for class. But she is very helpful & knows what she's talking about. I would say her class is for self-starters who need little guidance. Tests are good if you did H.W. & asked questions when needed.

Also knows how to pick good TAs! Awesome prof, awesome class :D", "Linda is awesome! This is the most interesting, most fun, and most relevant grammar class I've ever taken.

Take this class!", "Please avoid this professor at all costs. I took this class online and every week I had written 6-10 pages of research work just to pass.

Peg sets her students up for success. She is very helpful and wants her students to really learn about the subject material.", "This professor is incredible.

If you have the opportunity to take her writing class, do it!", "It was VERY difficult to earn a good grade. She will write on the board notes that are verbatim to the book and won't explain it well at all (if she can, she sometimes refers to students for answers). The programs had me sitting in tutoring for hours on end. The review guides given are decent but very vague, overall avoid this prof if possible.", "Best Prof ever. Hands down.", "She's a good professor and she makes the topics interesting. She teaches from power point a lot but it works for her.

Take her.", "Helped me improve my writting skills.", "As im sure she loves what she does, her teaching method was not for me. If you are a self learner then you will be bored in this class.

Loads of Extra Credit, Its impossible to not want to try. I'm a C student, If I can get an A in this class, anyone reading this should be able to do the same. Take here class, Trust: No Regrets. PCC's Best teacher Hands down. PS: She is SUPER NICE!!!!!!", "I loved her energy! Personally, I loved using creativity in journaling. She was approachable and great!", "Science Fiction and Fantasy Lit is a great class, both because of the subject matter and because of Prof. Jackson.

Do the reading and you'll ace the quizzes, plus she's more than willing to review papers and offer useful suggestions.", "Fun class. She has a lot of energy and a lot to say.

I interviewed her for a project in another class and she spend several hours chatting with me about her feminist views, which really helped me out and had nothing to do with her own class.", "Dr. Untereiner is passionate about what she teaches, which helps stimulate interest.

Nice lady but VERYYYYY tough grader and gives you an F even if you do the work.

May be a nice person, but prob the worst prof on campus...not even exaggerating", "She is one of the rudest professors I have ever taken. She will not let you eat or drink in class unless it's from a water bottle. No sodas or coffee. She goes over activities in class, but her tests are NOTHING like what she goes over. She will call you out if you're caught on your phone or you're talking while she is talking. Beware of her!!", "She is good intentioned, but she has pretty unclear assignments and doesn't grade easily. She is smart but the in class discussions are boring. I wouldn't recommend her for ENGL 14.", "GREAT PROFESSOR!!! Everyone who does well in her class loves her. If you understand her style of teaching you should do well.

I learned so much in her class and didn't miss a day or wish to miss a day ever! Teachers and classes like hers is what college is all about.

She is in a bad mood at least 3 times a week and if you need clarification on an assignment she seems to careless and is bothered that you would ask. If your that tired, perhapes it is time to retire.", "She is nice and easy going. Actually she does not trick you with the midterm/exam and its pretty obvious on what you will be tested on.

She has great guest speakers from the professional world and has wonderful contacts in the Entertainment Industry. The most fantastic bonus is that she is so HOT!! You aren't going to find a better looking Professor :-)", "She is extreamly nice, she will help you out as much as you need it. if you are failing the class or falling behind it is because you dont pay attention in class or do the homework. she is a great teacher and i'm doing well in the class and i'm not that great at math.", "So disappointing. I honestly feel like any of the girls in our class could do a better job of TEACHING this course than her.

My boyfriend is in the Navy, and when i asked for a week off she told me; \"This class is all about relationships, enjoy your week with your boyfriend.\" My favorite teacher BY FAR!

And she is making it GREAT. Other reviews are old so listen to me. This lady is a real sweetheart, slightly intimidating at first but that vanishes. Quizzes on Fridays are straightforward. Two short, simple papers as well. Has a sense of humor and is a little cutie. I'd take her again.", "Dr. Spock is an incredibly nice person and seems to genuinely care about her students succeeding. That said, the class is harder than you would expect. Its a lot of dense reading and she lectures the full class (sometimes a couple minutes after) but the tests aren't impassable. If you're a history major take her, but if not find someone easier.", "Professor Eisberg is OBVIOUSLY in love with astronomy & is very passionate about teaching it, she loves sharing her knowledge.

One of the funniest teachers I've ever had. Assigns a lot of reading, but not an overwhelming amount. Definately try to take her class.", "What I don't understand is how she is the chair of the department and still be the worst professor? Students have been saying she is horrible for years and she still has her job. I don't understand that. I guess the college and division don't care how bad she is at teaching. Someone else should be evaluating her besides her dept.", "Best professor by far. She is one of the few that truly cares about the well-being of her students.

Many students mirror these sentiments, but some do not truly realize how much she has helped them until later down the ro", "Very helpful and educated.", "No Comments", "Impossible to not like her. Good: Doesn't talk down to students! Bad: Unfortunately, now I want her to teach all my classes.

She was a sexy woman and could make a 3hr math class very entertaining. I am absolutely crushed she is retired.", "Very scattered...epitomizes the absent minded professor.

I worry about the number of grad students being turned out with poor grammar and writing skills barely comparable to h", "This course is a self-discovery course, so you would imagine for it to involve some degree of creativity. She claims to encourage creativity, but the truth is that she puts countless restrictions to what you can do in your work. During lecture, she says the same thing about ten times over, and she leaves little room for actual artistic work. So ugh", "she is really helpful if you ask for it. very interested in what you write about and is great when it comes to editing a rough draft so you can improve. she has helped me to improve my writing skills so much! she expects a lot out of her student so dont slack off. but she doesnt expect something of you unless she believes it can be done.", "Super easy class.

I would recommend her for sure!!!!", "No Comments", "She is not a bad teacher but she does things that really annoy the students.She is that teacher who wants to keep you until the last second of class and loves to hear herself talk.

She is a really cool teacher and is fun and easy to get along with. You are definately entertained in this class everyday. I totally recommend taking this class with her! You will be happy you did, plus we got out early almost everyday!", "She has never once lectured or taught any material the entire class. Stupid reading quizzes every weekend. All you do is show up to class she gives you a group presentation to prepare in 20 minutes and you teach the class yourself. She requires you too write ridiculous long papers for certain assignments. A horrible 100 level class.", "Great teacher, extremely supportive, made me excited to become a teacher.", "She was a delight! I loved this class so much and she offered so much help.

Fun, down to earth and approachable.", "This is the second class I've taken with Dr. P, and she never disappoints.

If you do the reading (there's a lot), you'll learn so much. Highly recommend.", "She will make you wait outside the classroom if you are late for even a minute. If the assignment is 2 pages she wants 2 FULL pages.....no more and no less???

She inspired and still inspires me to Go Deeper. Novels, articles, & other forms of research were our textbooks.", "Amazing teacher. Very knowledgable about the industry.

Classisnothard, she is!", "YOU ROCK!!!", "She's a very nice lady, but this class is extremely boring. She makes you do five papers throughout the semester on the in-class exercises, which aren't hard to do. She's a very fair and easy grader.

Tests are clear and she prepares you well. Great at explaining things gives great examples.", "Very frustrating teacher. Had a hybrid with her, and she doesn't respond to e-mail, no phone calls back.

She does not respond to phone calls or email. Takes several weeks to grade assignments.", "I thought to myself upon entering her class.....wow, she is a die-hard liberal, and I am NOT going to be happy. However, I would recommend her to everyone considering Poli Sci. She will open your mind to things you previously have never thought of. I can truly say she is brilliant; a little scattered, which hurt the class....but brilliant.", "Carla is a crazy little lady. She definitely keeps the class entertained.

The class is interesting but she makes it even more fun (that is, if you like math). She is truly an amazing teacher, she made my first semester much easier.", "Super super easy class!!! There is hardly any homework in this class. Basically what you don't finish in class is your homework. She makes the assignments pretty short and easy. She doesn't grade hard at all. Just show up and do the assignments and group work (worth 20 points but super easy) then you will pass easily!", "Better study because there are 4 tests and one paper. That's it. That's the whole class. Lectures are pointless, she reads off the PowerPoint (which btw are bright blue in lime green writing. Hard to read) and I only went for attendance.", "I made an A in the class but I had some med. term. experience before I took this class.

She does show favoritism, especially to those in her classes from the summer programs.", "This was one of my favorite classes that I have taken, she is a great lady and let's the class not only learn from her and the book, but from eachother and life experiences.

Prepares you for the real world.", "She is very passionate however hard to pay attention to. She does not like differing opinions but she will not give you a bad mark based on disagreement. You can expect to do a lot of work in her class. 2 essays, A LOT of readings for each class and a closing assignment. She might be better in the morning than she is in the evening.

Extremely poor communicator. Class requirements very clear. Tests extremely long-too much material per test-should break down test to be more manageable. Do extra credit. Do publisher's online study until you receive 100% on ea. Do study guides. MEMORIZE. I earned A but not without extreme effort! Not many earn A I'm told", "She's alright, a little intimidating, and she plays favorites, but over all she's not bad. She's very into multi-media, and if you're not then you better learn to love it. I dont think I ever had one plain drawing, everything had to have paint, pastels, washes, whatever. She likes what she likes. Attendance is crucial.", "Hard grader for no obvious reason. Missed one class and did all the papers which I thought were good (with good comments)and she ended up giving me a B+. There was no clear way to get an A and she ruined my 4.0 gpa.

Go to class if you need to, do the homework and her practice exams, and you will do well.", "Are you an art major? If you are not, I would avoid this class.

She also goes off on tangents to rant about her personal life even though it has nothing to do with the class content.", "She is a good teacher to get for Eng 101.

Glad she's gone - her book is a joke.", "She is nice and professional. I would recommend her", "Nice lady, cute lasy. Really easy class... has little to no info about computer graphics, although she is extremely experienced and knowledgable. If you want to learn something, don't take it.

She'll let you down -- she never showed up for any meetings that were scheduled.", "Great teacher, motivator, talker, advice giver, just all around greatness. I had her for all of my sports modules and I enjoyed every single minute and every single class. She's a very competitive teacher and I know many people that didn't like that about her.

One of the most caring and inspirational professors I've had!", "I enjoyed this class, even though 3-D is not my forte. We had some fun projects ( teapots, egg beating project, sled.)

Easy to talk to, very understanding lady. Plenty of energy but fun.", "She is passionate, but style of instruction and evaluation is not reasonable. No PPT, substantial readings. MCQ can be ridiculously tricky, and the ambiguous wording remind me of SAT. In discussion, you have to talk to get the points. The evaluation of paper totally depends on your TA, which could be subjective. Remember you have other GE options!", "She is very passionate about what she teaches, which is admirable. Rarely gets through the entire lectures but is nice enough to post all of them online. The papers and tests are really hard but she grades the papers easily. The class is definitely not a blow off but it is not impossible to get an A. You also watch a ton of movies.", "She's a really nice, smart, and polite person. She is strict on attendance but the textbook is rarely used since all exams are based on her lecture. There are three 50 question texts and 2 research papers that aren't too difficult. Other than that, there isn't any homework. Take good notes and you'll do fine.", "Oh my God! I made a C on 1301 with Shelton and an A in her class 1302, she got me interested in history, awsome teacher the best. Too bad she will no longer teach at San Jac. srping08 was her last sem to teach..", "Professor Dilek is a great professor. She is very caring and always ready to help.

You won't regret taking her.", "Reynolds does not lecture and give clear lessons about how to write effectively or interpret the literature she assigns.

Very hard grader; learned little about writing in this class. AVOID!", "She is good teacher and very kind individual. I introduce her to my son, and he said, Ms Adams is the nicest in PCC.

All I can say to anyone who takes her is: \"Good luck to you!\"", "She was a hard grader but she always explained what was deficient clearly. The homework was not extremely long, except on a few instances. She had trouble with a new book this quarter, but she graded us less harshly where she knew we would have troubles. Her lecture often differed from the book, but her lectures were in-depth and explanatory.", "Priverida has strong teaching skills, but she is a hard grader---not bad to look at either.", "she is horrible...talks to students like the are in fifth grade. take dr. shaw", "I actually loved Spanish prior to taking her class back in 2006. I actually had one of my majors in Spanish. After her course, I dropped it faster than you can say arriba. Not kidding. I dreaded going to her class once a week for THREE hours. It was torture.

Great at answering questions. Very knowledgeable.", "In my experience taking this class I noticed that Laidlaw wanted every one in the class to succeed and helped us every step of the way. Relatively easy and interesting class.", "What a great professor Joan is. Vibrant personality, humorous, and makes you feel very comfortable. Relaxing class, and all material is split up perfectly for lecture. McAfee is not a pushover. You need the book. The grade you get in this class is EXACTLY what you put into it. I am going to miss this class, it was my favorite one this semester.", "Awesome Professor! She is incredible. She demands alot from you but she takes you through it step by step and helps you every bit along the way. She is so interested in your growth as a pre-service teacher. As long as you do the work and make an effort you will do good in the class. BE PROFESSIONAL!! :)", "The tests are ridiculous! All questions are out of the book and over stuff that she didn't cover in class. It's good to go to class, though, because the in class points add up and can help make up for points lost on tests.", "Best English class i ever took", "She is a nice enough individual but absolutely NO help for the subject. The only \"teaching\" that she does is hand out print outs of how to use stat crunch and most of the time what she gives you is unclear and the examples are not helpful at all. I would only recommend taking this class if you want to teach yourself how to do statistics.", "Great interest Great professor 2", "She is amazing. She really knows her subject matter, which can make or break a language class. Dont take any other teacher! Use the book all the time, get tutor if needed LSS.

She cares about her students. You will have to do 3 speeches. If you pick topics that are compelling that no one else in the class would even think about doing then you will pass her class with a good grade. It's not easy A though, you will have to work for it!", "She is old-fashioned in her approach to teaching the subject matter. She is definitely not a political scientist and is probably best suited for a different discipline altogether. I found her courses to be poor preparation for graduate school.", "She is understanding and interesting. Just pay attention to her. She knows her stuff.", "Ok I change my mind! I thought she was cool, but NO!! She is only friendly with her favorite students. I never got the TA job even with my super high GPA. Very rude, cold and unapproachable.

I've had", "Interesting subject matter- good grasp of subject, but during discussions she does squint at you as though she thinks you're the s****of the earth. Not sure whether I buy that it's her \"thinking\" face. Grading seems random- people who don't read do well, people who do read fail. Laughs at her own jokes...also, wipes spit a lot. Kind of annoying", "one of my fav all time classes!", "Professor O'Shea is very smart and she knows what she's talking. Shes also very passionate about history, so her lectures are very detailed.

So easy, so clear on presentations. You could basically have never taken high school Spanish and you would be completely fine. Homework is easy and tests are straightforward. It would be harder to fail the class than to pass it. TAKE HER!!", "She is a really nice teacher, she is very devoted and explains everything clearly", "I took the online course. Lots of reading/writing essays or answering questions, but not a difficult course. Professor is understanding, helpful, and she gives credit for whatever work you submit.

You'll do well in this course as long as you atleast try.", "Very friendly, helpful and responds to questions outside of class quickly. Complete assignments and speeches the exact way she lays out, she is sort of \"my way or the highway\" but lays out the requirements clearly. Do exactly what she says and you'll get an A or B no problem. She grades attendance and missing class causes major points off.", "I had to drop this evil woman's class.

I never had trouble with advanced Physics, and have a 3.52 average, so beware,Avoid at all costs!", "No Comments", "Super inspirational! Loved this class, though she tends to ramble on about the same things for the first half hour of every class.

She expected way too much, had no mercy, and her comments were harsh. She seemed to be intelligent, but to the point of arrogance. And I hardly ever understand what she was talking about in class. Glad that class is over.", "She's a really smart prof and willing to help out. But the notes she provides are worse than bad, and there's not much to add during lectures. The readings were interesting but it was hard to apply them to the paper and final. I wish she relied more on her own teaching than on outside literature. Leaves much to be desired.", "This class was very easy. If you missed class its fine because she records the class. She goes straight to the point which I loved because I never stayed the whole time she usually finishes in about 30 minutes then you can do whatever you want.(which also means leave) Some class periods we did stay long on some of the more challenging topics", "knows her stuff makes you work funny cares about humor in the class lots of speakers and videos real life applications", "This was the worst teacher i ever had, people would sleep during her lecture. I recommend to not take this teacher cause a lot of people would fail.", "Hard but fair. Like the discussions. Eye opening.", "very clear and tells students all expectations. She offers office hours,extra credit, extra worksheets, ungraded practice homework, and even sends links for websites and youtube videos. She's the most clear professor ever.

Tests were rare and not very hard.", "She's awesome! Sweet lady. Her class is laid back. You have 3 papers. You have a peer revision on all 3.

On top of all of that, she's a wonderful person, too!", "Awsome teacher. And her class is a complete waste of time as far as learning is concerned.

I recommend her highly", "Feth was the absolute worst professor I have ever come across at CSCC. She is boring, rude, and has a dry sense of humor.

My advice is drop Feth instantly if you see her as your instructor.", "A Kindergarten teacher with a profesor's badge", "No Comments", "Worked with her on contract and found her to be extremely knowledgable.

She is a wonderful woman and a joy to work with.", "The best teacher I've had in years... Keep it up please.", "The course itself uses no textbook, so she has her own slides she posts. The midterm/final comes directly from these slides. She is not a easy marker but a fair marker. If you write a B grade answer expect that grade. Read those slides and expect an B+ or higher. Also she adjusts deadlines and grades if need be. Overall very kind professor.", "I gave you a hot pepper, too. I don't know why it didn't show up on here...here, have another.", "i thought this would be an fun class, but she's quite a hard ass.

Weak as far as covering different sides of an argument, but does use a broad arrangement of texts.", "TAKE HER!!!! I dont even like History and her class was a breeze.

I got A's on all of the tests!!If she were to teach other classes that I needed I would take her again!", "Dr. Long is hard and she has no tolerance for fools at all. But if your willing to work, you can learn a lot from her. She actually made me a better writer, which is something 12 years of public school and 3 previous english professors failed to do. She's also kinda sexy, especially when she smiles after making a off-color joke.", "Professor Feth is one of my favorite teachers ever. She teaches well and doesn't take any**** from immature students.", "I honestly think this class was pretty hard. Definitely go to all classes if you are not a history person even though attendance doesn't matter. Lectures are kind of all over the place and I felt like some of the info didnt flow well.", "difficult readings, alot of discussion, has alot of sense of humor, is willing to help and laugh with you in all situations and all problems. I love Wendy! she's awesome! a great teacher!", "I have trouble understanding why all of the other reviews are so positive. She was an easy grader, but we had to do excessive research for oral presentations. Also, she made many political comments that were unrelated to the course, regarding feminism, the ACA, the Iraqi war, etc. Her comments were unprofessional at best. Do not recommend.", "Dr. Hirsch is a busy professor. She gives LOTS of homework but READ & STUDY! Its possible 2 get an A in her class. Do ALL the hmwk & keep track of ALL your grades.

She doesnt expect you to be a rocket scientist ... just want you to live a healthy lifestyle.", "She comes to class late, and lot of cancel classes. Got B's on all her assignments and got an A in the class. Not really helpful outside of class. Attendent is helpful because she changes the assigment all the time", "Makes terms more easy.

You will have to work for your grade in her class. She wants us to succeed but she's not just going to give you what you don't earn. Her lectures are long & sometimes they make you want to sleep.

Shes a great person and i like her as a person, but as a professor; no thank you.", "If you will take this class you will feel as you are in the militery.", "The class information was overall easy, but it is an entry level psych course; however, there is a semester long research project that her class has to do, it lasts all semester and is extremely annoying, if you don't want the semester project than take the class with someone else. There was no tests, but points everyday in class.", "Sweet lady. Lots of videos and some art stuff. Mostly reading from the text and lectures with some group work. She assigns a few short, easy papers. She's good for GE.", "Her class was a three hour lecture where she talked nonstop. Pretty impressive really. She definitely knows her stuff.

I feel like I'm in the fourth grade. I don't know whether that's a product of good teaching or what. She's a very nice person though, and the Honors section is a little more interesting and challenging.", "Dr. Duma is one of the best lecturers in math. She explains in a way that makes it very clear what we need to know and what we don't. Her examples in class reflect directly what is going to be on the assignments/midterms and finals.

I would take her again!", "i really learnes tons from her even though she might think otherwise, but it was in her classes that I learned what I remember most about college, one of the most talented person i've met.", "This is honestly the worst prof I've taken in university by far. The world's laziest and irresponsible prof award goes to her. Minutes before the final exam she told the class things that were never on the online modules OR the textbook. The modules and textbook were NOT consistent at all. Trust,I can go on. AVOID THIS PROF FOR YOUR GPA'S SAKE!!!!", "Dr. White is one of the best professors I have ever had.

She is very opiniated, but she can defend every single one of her views with facts, statistics, etc. Also, if you have a different view, she will let you share with the class because she encourages debate. She will not treat you any differently if you have a different opinion. Do your readings and you will pass", "I really like Professor Newhart.

You do have to write a lot in class and she always gives you good feedback on your papers. I liked her!", "She is a great professor that will go out of her way to help you. Class is interesting, however, there are some concepts that are hard to grasp. There really isn't much homework at all, other than reading the chapters from the book.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!", "You have to GIVE UP to not pass.She is very willing to help you unless you are always absent & act like you could care less.She WILL answer your Q's & sometimes right before the tests students could write a problem on the board from the study guide. I got a B b/c I never did word problems.Also,HW isn't too important,it's more about your test grade.", "This is the only class that I have ever dropped.", "Professor McAfee was a very kind woman who reminded me of my kindergarten teacher. She made the assignments easy and clear. I'd recommend her again for sure.", "Very wild and hyperactive. Goes pretty quick. Nice lady, but certainly not the best bio teacher out there.", "She's a stickler about everything. She's not the one teaching, but she does drop in regularly. WATCH YOUR VIDEOS ! She quizes on them, and also make sure you go pick up your previous quizes, she reuses material.", "If you want an easy A because you took high school Spanish, DON'T take her. If you want to learn how to speak Spanish, please take her. Cristina (no H in the first name)knows her stuff. She does assign a lot of homework. All homework is required to be turned in to receive a grade. She's tough, but she gives many extra credit opportunities.", "Glenda's class was not that rough. It was mainly outside of class work and small projects. If you're okay with attendance mattering then you will do fine in this class.", "Great professor and amazing lecturer. Class consisted mainly of quizzes and papers. TA's do most of the grading.", "SHE IS THE MOST EASIEST TEACHER EVER. Seriously, if you have to take ENG 095, take her. Everything is easy, the papers only have to be a page long, very nice. I absolutely recommend her. She is a bit crazy and most immature people can't tolerate her, but if you want an easy A, here you go.", "This is the easiest class! Ms. Lewald really cares about her students. She is always willing to help if you need it. Take her if you can.", "Deb was great! She gave us fun assignments and was always enthusiastic. Sometimes her expectations were not always clear. But she knows when effort is put into a project and she takes note of it. The final Project was a blast too. Just remember to make the pojects your own.", "Professor Giampetro is a great professor! She has real life experience she brings to the classroom combined with respect for her students as individuals. She is cognizant and flexible when it comes to the work/life/school balance and work-load is reasonable yet challenging.", "Every person should take her women's studies course....it's easy, fun, and informative. She is really passionate about it. You'll be surprised how much you learn. TAKE IT!", "I loved Dr. Spock! Her class is probably one of the harder ones that I'm currently taking, but she gives LOTS of extra credit and is always ready to help. You will do more writing than you might like, but she gives good feedback. Lots of reading, lots of class participation. It's a tough class for a gen ed, but I would definitely take her again", "Great teacher. Truly willing to help. Really cares about students. Very hard class and the workload is heavy, but if you have to take this class, definitely take her.", "Basically this teacher is useless. Her midterm/exam included things we never learned and she makes the questions as confusing as possible. When I try to get ask questions, she can never explain it clearly. The class average was 60%, so don't believe what was written below. AVOID! (from a high GPA student)", "Andrea Woody is one of the best professors I've had. Super knowledgeable and teaches effectively. Even if you're intimidated by the sciences, this class will give you interesting insights. Best of all, she really cares about her students and philosophy of science. Go to office hours, she is also a great mentor!", "She's been an incredible mentor for not only me, but many others. She keeps her students in mind and updates on possible internshipsjobeducational opportunities. She has your back if you put the effort in--grades on development. LISTEN to her advice, and always ask questions. Don't be afraid to speak up. Hands-down, the best professor at OU.", "Prof. Adams has the students best in mind when she teaches this class. She gives you ample chances to get your work done and is very fair. I would highly recommend you take her class.", "Amazing amazing amazing teacher AND dean. She goes out of her way to please all her students! Take her if you can!", "this professor's class is easy. She explains computer assignments using a program known as spss in easy to follow steps. Good attendance is a must cause a lot of the lecture material as well as class readings ends up on essay exams. If you take the optional final your lowest grade is dropped. Your lowest computer hw grade is dropped.", "Yup, was a real bore this one.", "I thought bio was going to be very boring, but she managed to make it so much fun to the point that i was looking forward to her class & lab. She gives easy hw, she will tell you everything that's on the tests, & will have little reviews. She's willing to stay after class to help out. She's super sweet & her lectures are awesome! would take again!", "I took this class online over the summer.Have not received my grade but I am sure it will be an A.There is a lot of work but Cindy is super helpful if you are stuck on a project.She will call you if you need her to and she responds very promptly to questions.Happy I took this class online in the summer.Hard work, easy A if you do the work.", "Therese is the best! I highly recommend her to everyone. As far as her being \"biased\" towards Palestinians, she presents a balanced view of middle eastern issues often exploring elements our traditional media ignores. She is not the easiest, but you will learn alot from her if you open your mind and think critically about the material presented.", "She allows you to use notes on the tests but her questions on the tests are so out of the blue. She has you read and write down questions regarding the text before almost every class and if you're thorough, it could take around two hours. Her lectures are not posted online and they mostly consist of confusing charts or pointless stock photos. WORST", "She really is great. Very clear, helpful and she'll work with you until however long you need it. She grades kind of tough, and has a lot of comments on your work, but after you get to know her style it's cake.", "She may be a little unclear but if you as for help, she will help you. She does lecture a lot and can get a little redundant but I like her. Just work hard and she will notice.", "There is no textbook, she passes out sheets or just reads a sheet out to you everyday, not too much reading aloud. She seems unorganized and teaches to students who already know spanish well, if you don't she tells you to go study on your time. I learned more spanish in high school.", "This professor was THE best instructor as a teacher and intellectual who I have encountered since beginning community college and receiving my M.A. degree.", "If you attend class and do homework all comes easy except the final. That was hard.", "oh felt. i just love her. she is supper sweet and definitely wants her students to do well. sentence translations on tests, but she gives practice ones ahead of time. not a lot of HW, just a workbook that comes with an answer key. 3 or 4 oral presentations, but they're pretty easy and she isn't a hard grader. take it with her if you can.", "She is the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. She marked me wrong if i did my math vertically instead of horizontally(ex. multiplication),or if my fratcion lines were diagonal instead of horizontal...im not joking. She wont allow you to have scrap paper, and then takes points off if there are scribble marks on your paper. SUCKS!!!!!!", "Poor Judy. She really is a nice lady. But nice doesn't help you understand math. She reaaaally sucks at explaining anything. She fills in class time with calculator work and random stories about her travels. I am taking stats from her, which is like a foreign language to begin with. She avoids your questions, too. Dodge her class if you can.", "Hysterical, very clear, will repeat fingerspelling as many times as needed for people to understand. just wish she enforced \"voice off\" a bit more.", "Best professor ever!! Made class interesting and really enjoys teaching.", "Fun and nice lady. Helpful and understanding. Papers were easy, mostly opinion and personal stuff or interviews so it didn't require time consuming research. Class did kind of drag on sometimes, but it was an 3hr night class, so that happens. I would recommend!", "Great prof, and one of the best I ever took class with", "Avoid this class and professor at all costs. Lectures are a long convoluted mess that do little to further your knowledge. Ewa is one of those unapproachable, apparently infallible, professors whose exams will straight up fail an entire class. After which she will spend a good chunk of the next class making demeaning remarks to you and your peers.", "Professor Himmelbaum is an experienced, kind, and valuable teacher. Do not be discouraged. I love her!", "This class is NOT recommended... She expects so much from her students but teaches so little prior to the work you're supposed to do... take the class if you already know how to program but beware! for she takes points off if you don't program the way she does...", "About this class: turned out to be really interesting, although readings are long, they're interesting to read. Not a hard class, reasonable amount of work, do consider if you're in need of W credit. About Woody: It's easy to see how passionate she is. Although she is slow at explaining concepts, she is indeed knowledgeable. Her TA's are amazing", "I took the online spring course and it was easy. Yes, you will have to read the whole book, but it's interesting information. The test and quizzes were simple and easy if you read the chapters. She answered all my questions in a timely manner. She uses a point system instead of grades, which I actually liked. I would take her again.", "Very good teacher, extremely knowledgeable. Always willing to help", "Horrid experience. Not a fan of reading, and we did a decent amount.. Not the easiest grader. Participation is important, but all that seems to happen is random rants completely off-topic. Pretty boring class.", "I took Professor Jackson-Jones in 1991-92. She is an outstanding instructor! The skills that she has bestowed upon me has helped me with term papers, essay, etc. I am so thankful for her!", "Great professor she help me a lot , my other English classes were A, THANK YOU", "Even though she gave me an A-, I cannot, in good conscience, give her a good review. She is a horrible teacher. Even though I have a great grade, I have learned next to nothing. I just hope I will be prepared for Fre 102.", "Loved this class! I felt that this class should be deemed necessary for all people who ever plan to/will procreate...AS it may be seen as a guidebook through early childhood. Don't buy book, not necessary. Test based on lectures, but she is amazing.", "No Comments", "Took Shelly for 101 and 102. She is a great teacher and willing to work with and help her students. Highly advise you to take her classes!", "Was in college 10 years ago. Tina helped shape my future and was one of the best professor's I had. Gave great advice for career and life and made class fun.Pretty hot too :)", "I enjoyed her group assignments. We learned a lot in group. Her tests are very reasonable.", "Dr. Brown is one of the most passionate professors I have ever had. She loves modernism and postmodernism and it shows! I learned so much and was able to apply what I learned in other courses. It was a fun, easy class and I would highly recommend taking a course with Dr. Brown.", "there are not words to explain that she is a wonderful skilled teacher. she knows the material and she is willing to help you any time. you have to remember she is clear and direct in her instruction. her projects are straigh foward as long as you follow each step in her instructions.", "Prof. Pluss is sweet and upbeat. Her \"quizzes\" are about 40 questions. However she does drop the lowest of the 4. There is a group project and a final project. Easy A if you study for the quizzes.", "Therese is the best professor I've had at Evergreen. She is very knowledgeable and well-read, but not arrogant. She is great at running Seminars, which is so important at TESC. I hope I can take more credits from her in the future.", "personal favorite", "Easy marker. The beginning material is pretty simple so there's not much to discuss there. She does a pretty good job when the topics get a bit more complex, but since the course isn't proof-based there is quite a bit of handwaving when it comes to theoretical rigour (a necessary evil)", "Worst handwriting ever looks like a child scribbled on the board. No very helpful. Major Bi...", "Took the night class with Prof Yasmin. Really HATED Spanish and struggled with it, but had to take Spanish 3 to fulfill requirements. Take the night class with Yasmin. She's absolutely great. Free points for going to class. Grades compositions easy. Awesome.", "Very fun but challenging class! If you're open minded, by the end of the semester you'll know how to tap. Gel is one of my favorite professors. She's hard, straight to the point, and a great teacher.", "One of the finest profs Brock has - not an easy prof but passionate, committed and dedicated. You will learn so much from this woman. I would take another course from her in a heartbeat.", "Julia is absolutely wonderful person.She has the greatest big smile. She reminds me of the actress Gina Davis. She is so inspiring!", "Expect to read 4 novels during this course. No textbook, but she puts all relevant readings online for students. Expect to have to read an article and answer questions as homework for every class. Most of your grade comes from the extremely important book reports. Most class periods are spent gathering in a large circle and discussing as a class.", "Makes it easy to understand the systems behind the grammar. Could do more work with vocabulary, but that's something you can get at home. Has a wonderful German accent that makes her kinda hot.", "Has missed 2 classes; wastes my time. Doesn't keep office hours. Loses homework. BAD, BAD professor.", "NOT THAT GOOD AT ALL. AMATEUR HOUR", "horrible", "She is very enthusiastic and has a love for teaching that reminds us of why college offers just a lot more than grade school. She reinforces the importance of using the words \"I\" and \"feel\" which help re-establish the individuality of a writer. She was a thrill to have, and her advice, as well as wisdom serve as an added bonus on her resume.", "By far the best professor, dean and person at St. Johns. I've never learned so much in a class. She keeps it real with you and gives you whats expected in the real world. For once in my life I would be upset when class was canceled! Please take her for 1008 or 101. And easy A none the less!", "Having our text books seemed pointless after awhile, but our projects and classwork was always easy and interesting. An easy A and an awesome teacher! I love Dr. Todd!", "Fabulous professor. Be prepared.", "Her grading system totally sucks for tests and homework. The only reason I went to class was because she was so strict about attendence.", "Great teacher one of my favorites and shes hot too", "On the first day of class, she stated she was not a statistician. She literally only writes definitions on the board and nothing else. she likes to repeat how much she doesnt know about stats and that she only knows math. not really worth taking the class, unless you dont want to learn how to calculate the actual stats.", "I highly recommend this professor! She is intelligent and cares about her students very much. I loved her class the most out of all of my political science courses so far. Be prepared to read everything though, and to work for your grade. The tests aren't too bad if you read all of the material and keep up with your assignments.", "Good teacher but personally I like Ms Muroski at Hazleton better.", "Okay so you're all being way too hard on her. Yeah she assigns a lot of reading but this is college. We're supposed to be learning, not getting grades for nothing. She has intriguing class discussions, grades fairly, gives helpful feedback, and she really knows her stuff.", "She is so crazy. She will ask a question at the beginning of class then go down the roster until she finds the answer shes lookin for. Avoid the crazy stare and beware!", "Useful online course that explains some of the basics of personal financial planning. Joan was fair and clearly defined all expectations for this course. Quizzes, Mid-Term, and Final Examination were not overly difficult. Read the text, do the chapter problems, and review all of the modules before a test and you will be fine.", "Good lookin smart girl.", "she is vert good at what she does and extremely helpful", "No Comments", "No Comments", "if it wasn't for the fact that she took attendance i might not have made it - considering it should be an intro class in a subject i normally love. her lectures are the readings and as for grades, she gives you what you probably deserve minus one letter point. when discussion happens, she doesn't lead and it quickly becomes repetitive.", "woo !", "she is so sweet and easy", "Very easy class. She curves her tests so receiving a B is easy. The powerpoints and study guides don't help much with tests. I never read the textbook and still received an A. I have a 101% in the clas.", "This professor was amazing at explaining how to derive the equations she was teaching us. She not only explained why we needed to learn the material but applied it to real life. If you've ever had officer hours with her, you'll find she truly wants you to learn the material and will help you in any way she can.", "Unless your a native spanish speaker, avoid her. She seems unsure of her own language. She's confusing too- you never know what's for homework or on an exam. And, she likes essays VERY VERY clearly outlined, thesis, support etc. Otherwise she can't understand it. She doesn't directly answer quesiotns either.", "Course is listed as online but should be shown as hybrid because you have to go to campus for tests. Have to email her multiple times before receiving a response and by that point it is too late. Uninterested in helping students in anyway. Horrible at clarifying what needs to be done. If you take her course you will regret it.", "I took her for orientation, which she'd never taught before. We had a ton of attendance/paper requirements at campus events, and I had to miss another class for one. Also, she only teaches to business students, she doesn't really worry about anyone else, so if you aren't a business major, it kinda sucks.", "Great class!!! I made a B but i could have made an A if i would have put forth a little more effort!! Shes fun!", "*shudders", "My favorite profesora in college so far!!!", "She makes math so fun and interesting...She go's out of her way to make you understand. she is a wonderful professor take her and you will be fine...If you don't take her you will be a dum ass...", "She is amazing! If you come to class and take the notes the three tests will not be a problem! She does a great job of making this class interesting, she seems very passionate about what she teaches which is a huge plus. You don't wanna listen to professor who doesn't care about what they teach right???", "Because of her behaviors, I changed the major. She is very tough grader proferrsor, during my first year in the university I faced lots of probelms and these probelms because of her. I emailed her for asking the questions about lab, she told me that I need to study by myself and she was not a high school teacher. I was so dejected.", "Best professor I've ever had. I want to be her when I grow up.", "You can tell by the way the person above spelled extremely.. They just may not be that smart her class was fine. You just need to go", "Great professor! She is very smart and very nice. Class lectures and discussions make sometimes difficult readings much more understandable.", "Started out easy then turned on full blast! So not a good class!! Teaches like you are in 1st grade. Helps only certain \"english Major\" students. Avoid this class!!!!", "She is not horrible like everyone says. She is very nice. Very intelligent and passionate about her field. Her tests are harder than usual, because they are like the license exam. But I quickly got the hang of them and did pretty well. Her project is long, but not that hard when you get the hang of it. You learn alot!", "She explains everything in GREAT detail until everyone understands what it is they need to!!!", "Very real professor who gives no BS. She tells you the way it is and what the history really was like. She gives her opinion (which tend to be very strong), but hears other peoples opinions and respects them. Learned so many great things from this class and professor; highly recommend!", "Another fine instructor who also somehow seems to keep the kitchen running. Great knowledge of the industry and the people who run it. And a nice person as well.", "Awesome teacher, very willing to help, but has her favorites", "No Comments", "DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! she made things so much harder then they needed to be. She makes you show work for every tiny detail (simple adding and subtracting) I didn't listen to a review I read and took the course, listen to this one and DONT!", "Kaci is a great teacher. True, you dont have the time to complete projects out of class (all are done in class), but she helps you and has no problems getting back to you with any questions.", "I'm a business major and even though I got an A in this introductory internet-based business course, I did not have much fun. Sure it was nice doing work on my own time and learning about business as a whole, but there was little emotion or passion from Prof. Goodman. When we did have to meet in class it seemed pointless. But the class was easy.", "lazy prof, not helpful to tend to students' questions. Not consistent with what she said would be covered on midterm/exam.", "She's at times difficult to understand with her accent, but after a while you get used to it and her accent's not too big of a problem. All she does is read the book word for word. She rushes through the problems as if we should understand them already. She does help with homework once a week, which is helpful.", "I'll never take her class never...!!!", "WOW!! class is sooo easy! If you want an A take her!!! No book needed & she does reviws w/ class b4 test. (which are basically the answers). 50 mult. chice no essays! Taking as summer class now!", "A wonderful professor! She provides a clear outline of the course, and sticks to it! There are in-class readings and discussions for participation points. No exams, BUT a few pop quizzes - just read what she says to read! Research paper is 30% of your grade, but she lets you submit 2 drafts and she is there every step of the way if you need her!", "Dean Willis wants people to get to know each other because it is important to know your students.

There is alot of work but its so much fun & u will b so happy w/ the final project @ the end. She is so helpful & she prepares u 4 the 2 tests she gives in class. Show up 4 class & u'll get over 100%!!! I loved this class & her!", "One of the best dance professors in RI. The class was very fun but probably the most challenging. If you're willing to learn she will help. Recommended professor.", "Class was filled with fill in the blank notes and that's all you needed to study and fill out the study guides with. Tests go along with the study guide and there's even a review in class for extra credit. She's helpful but a little sassy. Online homework was super easy too, it didn't take long at all.", "Excellent instructor, take the class !!!", "Best Class Ever! She made us learn the material and design.", "Fantastic teacher! Supportive and great at getting her point across. Thought provoking and very passionate about her field. It's contageous, and what she teaches changes your views on children forever. Teachers don't get better than this!", "Great class! Expect to work you ass off though! One of the only class you prob wont fall asleep in, she has a lot of energy. DONT BRING YOUR CELL! But great class!", "Everyone should take Shelly's classes, she is a wonderful teacher who works hard with you. Hilarious as well.", "No Comments", "suggest to take a different prof. you will learn in the class however, there are quizes everyday and the readings are about a hundred pages. no midterm just paper and final but the quizes are the majority of your grade so you can't mess up and you will get a 0 if you miss a class. not easy. no spark notes", "She is great! She makes YOU personally responsible. She tells you how life really is. She does not tolerate immaturity, ghetto, BS, goofing off. She worked very hard to get her PhD. She expects you to work hard in her class and in life. You may hate speech, but you will come out of her class one step closer to being a real woman or man.", "she's a great teacher and she really gets inside of your head...i loved the class", "Long boring lectures and exams that don't accurately represent what was taught in the homework, as well as in lecture. However, the exams are heavily curved.", "I took her 7 week course, and to be honest, I was scared out of my mind on my first day with her. She's tough but she definitely knows what she's talking about. This was my second time in the course. The first time I withdrawled because I was failing, and the second time around I got an A! I recommend her for sure.", "bad news", "she's so passionate about the course and it really shows which definitely helped me stop being bitter about having to take this to graduate. the paper really isn't that hard and the weekly quizzes make it easy to know where you stand in the course. I highly recommend her.", "Amazing professor. Very thorough. I would love to take more classes from her", "I really liked her! She was very respectful to students and understood that not everyone would learn at the same pace. Very organized!!!! Loved the online quizzes that you could take until you reached 100%. Lots of Extra Credit opportunities. She really cared about music and teaching music to students who probably have never studied it yet.", "Either very smart or a very good actor, but lacks the ability to answer questions or present the issues to allow first-year law students to comprehend. Way too much irrelevant reading!! Perhaps she would be better for upper-level students. To answer her questions it is necessary to read her mind. Run!!", "I wish I would have had her for the classroom part, because I enjoyed her lab so much. If you come to class, do your work, and maybe crack a book every once in a while, you will pass. She was also very helpful.", "Have to study for the tests, but the class is very easy. She tells you exactly what you need to know for the test and even gives a study guide.", "Ms. Benavides is very clear and easy to understand. She makes the class fun to be in. She genuenly cares about her student and what they are learning. Take her if you get the chance. GO MS B.", "Dr. Estrada is an extremely helpful teacher.

Petty, mean spirited, unforgiving, rude, difficult, stingy with time and praise, unwilling to deal respectfully with young students.", "No Comments", "Une des meilleurs profs de poly sans contre-dit. elle a une bonne energie positive qu'elle resussie a transmettre a ses etudiant. Jamais de mauvaise humeur, elle a tjr le temps pour ses etudiant, ce qui est franchement pas le cas pour les autres profs de poly.", "Awful professor who was biased against the guys in the class. Made 7 of the 8 guys redo their papers even though (in my best opinion) we did well. I do not recommend her... EVER.", "If you want to get an A in this class you have to really analyze the films. Take a lot of notes and participate. I got an A- by working my ASS off. Two in class essays and one final paper. The films are pretty good too.", "Terrible at explaining. Gets highly confused over any questions. Most disorganized teacher I've ever had. Wastes most of the time in the course. Doesn't actually teach, just grades. Would have dropped this class after first class if I listened to my instincts. She should be fired. I love art and wanted to learn more, too bad I had to teach myself.", "I thought Public health would be really interesting. Her tough grading is making me regret taking this class. I've worked very hard on all of my homework assignments but there always seems to be a problem. When she tells me to fix something and I do then something else is wrong.", "This class was awful, the book was so confusing and difficult to use (she wrote the book). The lectures were mildly interesting, but didn't seem to have any continuity. I would not recommend this class.", "Great teacher and she makes history extremely interesting. Everyone in the class really liked her.", "Prof. Sue is the best professor I have ever had. She is so willing to go out of her way to help students and make sure they succeed. You have to write 250 word papers each class, but they become pretty routine and are simple. She is very knowledge, but you have to come to class ready to discuss and listen. I would definitely recommend her!!", "I believe she has changed her teaching style since these last comments. She's very into the class , but its just too much for a 110 course. Had to curve the mid-term and final because the averages were 70s. She would be great for a higher level course, but you can definitely take an easier professor for this class.", "Such a great teacher...if your not good in math do her extra credit it helps!!!", "Her lectures are absolutely pointless the only real reason Ito go is for the handouts she would give. She claims cares for critical thinking yet the midterm and final are multiple choice. The amount or reading is absolutely ridiculous! The amount of reading is absolutely ridiculous! Trust me and please save your self don't take this class!", "Loved Mrs. Perry! At the beginning of the semester, she said the class would be hard. But as long as you read the text and pay attention to her lectures, you should pass with flying colors. She applies some of her life stories to her lectures, which makes it very easy to understand. Lot's of extra credit opportunities as well!", "Ida... you can tell she is an amazing nurse and an even better woman. You can tell outside of class she is very nice... but in class is different. During exams she puts tissues in your face, takes your jacket, and once made me move my arm because I guess I could be cheating??? The class is hard, dont get me wrong, but it is definitely doable. STUDY", "If you have not taken a Condit class you are crazy! She is an amazing person. Helpful and understanding. However, her class is not structed by any means. Very inconsistent with due dates and assignments. Class discussions are great and will always keep you interested, she really makes you think! Oh, be prepared for a group project...", "Didn't teach the class, instead the students ran the class. Means well but doesn't seem knowledgable", "I would not take her again. She taught the online portion for the hybrid class, but not the lab. This makes it difficult because it's like 2 different classes! She never responds to emails and doesnt answer her phone. You never know what is going to be on the test, so you have to study everything since you cannot get ahold of her to find out.", "I truly recommend taking this class. I have never learned so much!! Her classes are very difficult, but definitely manageable. Her lectures are interesting and funny, and she is also very understanding.", "Not a good professor, she makes the easiest problems harder than they already look. Also, she deducts way too many points from homework and tests for a simple mistake. Take her at your own risk!", "Anyone seriously interested in political theory should take Dr. Condit. Her class intellectually challenged me more than any other. I do wish however, that she had been more clear about which readings we would be tested on. Both the reading scheduled AND study guides she posted would have assigned readings that just wouldn't show up on the tests.", "She is awesome. She will bend over backwards to help you. Great teacher.", "Very hard to follow, slide presentations are unlabeled, making images difficult to identify (crucial for exams). Tough grader, but the tests are doable. The case study was a nightmare. While Morna was willing to help through email and meeings, her criticism was never constructive or helpful. Make sure you use the TA!", "Very nice lady. Tends to not describe all topics very clearly and tends to go off on tangents about feminism. She is very opinionated and she wants it known. Chances are you will probably disagree with her at some point, but she does make you learn. She is also kind of flexible on grading, I certainly did better than I thought I would.", "good teacher", "The best chemistry teacher I have ever had!!!!

In class assignments are easy. Homework should be easy but she expects essays to be written like an 8th grader. I am an A English student and I got Cs on some of the essays I turned into her. However, she allows you to rewrite papers for a higher grade. Final was super easy! She comes off as rude sometimes.", "Easily the best ISOM professor. I too have had her for 4 semesters straight, and her classes have been extremely rewarding. She's serious in course work, so expect to work hard for your grade while building useful skills for your first job. She goes out of her way to make sure you succeed; put forth the effort and she'll return it tenfold.", "This Professor is you advisor (unfortunately) for env. majors and she is no exception in the \"I am useless\" bandwagon. Thats right, her lectures and exams are total different ball games, so dont expect anything better by attending her class regularly. She is a plain \"I dont make sense\" professor. Avoid her. NIU has the worst geology dept.", "Be careful..she has her favorites & not-so-favorites...moody..tests are unfair. If she makes a grading error on your exam you must challenge it in writing!! Even though it was her mistake! Stay away from her at all costs!", "No Comments", "eh it was ok", "This class is a must for everyone. It is wonderful and eye opening. She is a hard grader on papers...so make sure you work on them ahead of time and have her check them for you. However..she is very passionate about the topic, and teaches well", "Deb's not a very good teacher, but I enjoyed her assignments, at least. Use the assignments as opportunities to push yourself, show good craftmanship, and you should enjoy the class and do well.", "Only grades in the class are 3 exams. Tests are easy if you take notes and study. Tests are 35 multiple choice. Gives a few extra credit points if you go to class. She shows several movies and has several guest speakers. Great class and great professor. Would absolutely take again! Attendance not mandatory and textbook not needed", "easy, easy, easy. tests are online and you can retake them as many times as you need. If you need an elective. take this class.", "School is for learning and she makes it a horrible experience. Yells at you, humilates you, and makes you feel unconfident for no reason. She said that she became a nurse for the money and it shows beacause she has no compassion at all. I left the school due to the way she treated me and the lack of professionalism she displayed. It was pure abuse", "Great professor for learning, but needs to be more lenient for a 100 level course. Grades a little too hard on speeches and assigns way too many other assignments and papers besides the speech itself.", "Writing this mostly as a rebuttal to the last comment posted. I worked on the final by myself & received an A on it, as well as for the final course grade. Granted, it took me around 5 hours to complete. Attend class, take notes, pay attention, & ask questions if you're unsure of something. Dr. Carmean is a good professor.", "She is the bomb. Great teacher and competitor. Fun classes.", "Anita is a nice person, but she generally has no idea what she is talking about and is usually completely unprepared for her lessons. The book actually tries to show you the content of the course, I have doubts if she has ever read it.

She is very helpful and cancels class A LOT!!! When she does have class you mostly sit around and talk because she is very laid back.", "I took her class in 1975 or 1976 just because she was so hot! Back then she had a great attitude and was great to look at.", "ms nelson is one of the best teacher. she deal with the problem and visit desk to desk until the student is not clear .she is very helpful and she makes the course very easir so i will not be able to find any teacher better than her.i am planning to take the same teacher in the next calculus class but its my unfortunate that she is not going to tak", "This professor is a joke. Aced all my tests, did every single homework assignment, but was given a 2.8 due to not being in class ever single day. If you want to take a class that reminds you of high school, then take her classes.", "Judy is generally a few minutes late to class, but she always gives an overview of what to expect in class that day. She's helpful if you have questions. The plays and movies watched/read are fun if you involve yourself otherwise you might drift off. The essays are easy if you just sit down and do them, otherwise they pile up quick. Super nice lady", "great class", "No Comments", "Gives a lot of homework, its pretty easy and is worth it. Very nice and just wants her students to do well.", "Best English teacher I have hever had! Really made me open my mind and think in new ways.", "Pluss is hysterical and made COMM Research Methods bearable. There are no surprises here and the final is just the four quizzes she gave throughout the semester. Of those four, she drops the lowest one. There were 5 assignments, 5 quizzes (including the final). The material can be dry but that's not on her. she made a boring class fun, take her.", "Took her special topics class...she is a BRILLIANT woman and very excited about the material...as others said her class will be your life for the semester and she is tough but you will learn a lot...DO NOT take for an easy A or if you just want to skate by, if you're willing to work hard you will learn TONS", "She calls herself a feminist, but that's just her justification for despising men. Had her for Sociology of Linguistics and she doesn't know a single thing about linguistics. The worst thing is that when she doesn't know something, she just makes it up. The studies she had us read were bogus, too.", "First things first. I am not a lazy student and I do all my work. However, this professor is something else. He belittles you if you ask a question. He's very rude and curses all the time. He doesn't even teach all he does is show videos and talk about irrelevant things in class. Would never take again or would not recommend!", "okay prof. i really didnt like her too much.. she loves to hear herself talk and doesn't take into consideration others ideas and point of views. She wants you to notice what she notices, basically nothing is open to interpretation (and that's the whole point of taking a film class). 2 in class exams and a paper..not bad. want an A..good luck", "She is sweet love her class and care about her student, easy to get an A", "Didn't know anything about theatre before this class. Easy, no acting. Fun. Learned alot. Work but easy. Highly recomend for a global perspective :)", "Dr. Keehn is the best prof. I've ever taken. She leads her class by modeling instead of standing up there and lecturing to us what we should do as teachers. She shows a personal interest and gets to know everyone of her students by name. Something few profs care to do anymore.", "Laura is one of the worst english professors on campus. She is moody, aggressive, and tries so hard to be liked by her students that she comes off very annoying. I took her for EWRT 2A on campus and she was very unorganized and confusing. She didn't have a set calendar and her canvas page was a mess and she was very rude if you asked for clarity.", "SHE IS AWSOME, A GREAT ENGLISH TEACHER", "outstanding. she may be tough but i think she helped me figure out why i wanted to teach phys ed.all you have to do is pay attention,speek upin class, pass the test and just show that you care about this major and you will be fine.she is tough but its to help you get ready for the real world", "You have a LOT of readings every week. The midterms, final, and papers (2) are based on these readings! She repeats what is important in lecture so you can't miss it! Participation in discussion is a must for points. GO TO THE TA for help on the 2 papers! It makes a huge difference. I went from a C+ (1st paper) to B+ (2nd) after meeting w/ the TA.", "Very helpful, tries to make sure all students understand the material. Very willing to spend extra time and effort for extra help. Just go to class and try to participate.", "Nice lady but clueless. Announcing that she was single and available didn't help. Begged for us to give her fives....I thought that was inappropriate.", "Dr. Z is a very sophisticated professor. Her lectures are pretty good and interesting but her tests have nothing to do with her notes so you have to read the book very well! Also a lot of points are based on attendence!", "Honestly, this lady would be better off teaching middle school English. Work is very childish and not challenging at all. She is a very nice lady, but very disorganized. Assigns a lot of work, but very unclear when it is due. Easy A, but would have actually like to have learned something... anything actually.", "Do yourself a favor and do not take her class. Only take her if you are really good in math otherwise you'll have a really hard time struggling. She's very difficult to understand and not that helpful. Her lectures are tedious. I usually don't write reviews but I felt obligated to for this professor because she the worst professor i've had at PCC.", "No Comments", "She is one of the best professors I've had at WMU. She really knows her lectures and is extremely knowledgeable of her subject. She is helpful and very respectful. Her tests are difficult so you will need to study a lot. You can buy the book for practice problems, but not mandatory. I got an A and never bought the book.", "This class is aweful!! i was told it was so easy, but it definitey is not. You must earn your grades, and the essays are graded sooo hard! She knows what she is talking about, but she is so uninteresting. Russian empire/federation is boring and i hate coming to this class! attendance quizzes are frequent, and they suck! i hate this class!", "Outstanding instructor. She is just a delight. Brings a wealth of knowledge and a spirit of genuine helpfulness to the class. She is one of MU's stars!!!", "EXTREMELY EASY! My friends told me it was easy, but I was not prepared for the simplicity of this teacher and class. She explains things VERY clearly, almost to the point of condescension. Lets you out early a lot and if you read aloud in class when she asks, you usually don't have to go to class on Friday. Highly recommended...", "Ms. Jost wasn't helpful at all. As a matter of fact-- still waiting on grades promised earlier. Stay away.", "She is nice.", "Professor espana honestly tries to help everyone, she gives a lot of opportunities of extra credit and she cares about her students! Take her, it will be the best thing you've ever done.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably gained more from her classes than from any other. Her enthusiasm about teaching was present in every single class.

I only wish all of my professors cared as much as she did.", "Mrs. Hays is a very sweet lady. She seems to genuinely care about everyone, and wants you to do well.

You will receive an easy A!", "Great prof and probably the best prof I had this year. Assignments were easy and her instructions were easy to follow. Her lectures are always interesting and insightful. The best feature of this course is the ROM assignment!", "Great teacher! Organized, well prepared class structure, and extremely helpful. You will not fail if you follow the pattern- Monday: Notes, Wednesday: Homework help, Friday: Quiz. Kind of kooky, but well worth your time.", "This class is not meant for the 21st century. I feel, like I already know more about computers than this professor does. She doe not speak English well and is mad boring. The class is a joke. One of her classes got cancelled, because noone wants to register for her class. She does not seem like a computer expert. Extremelly boring!", "Dr. Koene is awesome. Her class is very interesting and there are many opportunities to work on conversation skills. She is kind and fair and has a lot of experience; she is a Spanish guru.", "loved the professor extra credit helps", "I have taken several classes from Kate and she's fabulous. She's controversial, unapologetic, and constantly challenges her students to *really* think instead of regurgitating information.", "No Comments", "She is nice and whenever you have a test and mess something up she will go through it with you until you get it right, so it's hard to make a bad grade in there. She likes it when you practice so be sure to do that. It isn't a hard class for me.", "TAKE DR. KEEHN. She is tough, but worth it. You will learn a tremedous amount of useful knowledge in her class. We love you, Dr. Keehn!", "The reading for my class was out of control!! And she didn't give very good feedback on papers so i didn't feel like i got that much out of the class.", "Ms Ablarde is the most kindhearted, hilarios and helpful teacher I have ever had. She has made school very interesting and makes me want to go. Her refrences to the Simpsons have made class more livly and fun. Ms Ablarde helps her students even on her own time if they are having troble understanding the matirial. I think she is awesome!!! :D", "I regret not dropping this class from the start. There is just so much reading for this class it's almost unbelievable. She's a really nice lady but I physically cannot keep up with the readings. Stay away if possible", "I took an online course from Dr. Farrer. I learned a lot and she is very helpful. I am working on a Master's and would definitely recommend this program to my friends.", "Probably one of the nicest professors you'll ever have. She's so helpful, really organized and her classes are almost NEVER the full time. Her study guide is almost the exact same thing as the test. Overall a really good teacher and nice lady", "I took Mrs Allen Fall of 2011.Two thngs you need to know: (1)because she gets off topic a lot you HAVE to read the material before class, and (2)class participation is a MUST!She can be a little sarcastic but she means no harm. Laugh at her jokes, be on time to class & read the material = easy A.", "Forget what the other bad reviews told you, I just took her (Fall 2013) and she is really chill and funny. If you take this class you will pass as long as you don't skip a lot of classes.", "Eisberg is AMAZING. Very enthusiastic and easy going professor and is always available to help. She tends to ramble though, she'll spend 20 minutes answering a yes or no question but I'd take her again. As long as you go to class and do the homework and online quizzes you'll pass and there's a few extra credit opportunities.", "If you want to turn in a 3 page paper every week then take her class. Her grading is very hard. Lectures were so boring so plan on getting a lap top to pass time. She never looks at the students when she lectures just at the ceiling or at the wall behind us. Don't take her if you have a choice.", "She is a great teacher. She is also a veru nice person and very friendly. I learned a lot from her.", "The money I spent for this class should have gone to charity instead of her.", "Online version. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to take after you finished FIN300 (many similar mathematical concepts). The tests are simple if you do your readings (all open book). The exam was ridiculously easier than I thought. Just do the easy practice questions in the textbook and online modules. When I met her in person, she was extremely friendly.", "Professor Von Barghahn-Calvetti, or 'BVB' as she prefers, is easy to like because she clearly enjoys her work. Lectures are extremely well-researched. If you're looking for an easy A with little work, go elsewhere. She expects a lot of research for papers & presentations. Still, she is always available for feedback & is generous with grading.", "took her for sociology. she's not hard at all but she will get off topic, A LOT. Read the book to pass because she speaks of things in the book prob. 40% of the class.", "Prof. Kaplowitz is an amazing professor, she makes you read a lot though. If you don't like to read don't bother taking her class. Quizzes are done either before every class or every other class. I hated reading, God knows I still do but she makes you read interesting novels that will have you wanting to know what's next. Do the work, guaranteed A.", "Wonderful prof! Always got out of class early. Simple take home exams. And was allowed to use notes on final in class. Easy A!", "Her class is a lot of work, but it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Show up, start assignments/projects early, study for tests, and ask questions if you need to. There are 11 pop quizzes, but they're only 2 points each, you get to take them with your group, and she checks them over before accepting them. No reason not to get full credit.", "she is a great grader. if you hand in a paper shell correct it and hand it back then you fix it and give it to her youll pass. she only uses your top 4 paper and test grades, and gets rid of the other ones.", "She is an ok teacher, but I think she should act more professional and keep her personal life personal", "Great professor! Very interested in all sports, very competitive. Just dont be a primadona and show up and you are pretty much guaranteed an A. Class is also very fun and interesting! P.S. she loves to talk about the soccer league she is in so beware!", "Her assignments were lame and she barely held our interest. Also, she got highly frustrated if any of us tried to enjoy being in studio for eight hours. The sled project was tons of fun, but she just threw it at us without any introduction to woodworking and expected us to make fine quality sleds.", "Please save yourself!!", "I really learned a lot in her class", "She is the worst professor that I took because she is not helpful at all.", "Normally I hate my comm studies classes, but Kristine is funny, understanding, helpful, and smart. She truly cares about her students and the material she teaches. I wouldn't say her class is either easy or hard, but she challenges you in a way that makes you want to do well. I took her \"advanced topics in comm studies\" and it's a great class!", "She is a very good teacher. Easy, if you do the work. She isn't harsh on grading and responds to emails quickly. Don't take her super early in the morning; her voice will put you to sleep. Her attempts at being funny are appreciated.", "shes aweful and has no priblem trying to embarasse you or make you feel stupid", "She's a very nice person. She keeps you awake and helps you understand the content and she's pretty funny as well. Just do well on the exams, turn in all assignments and participate and you're golden.", "Boring instructor. All she did was lecture from the book and test. What I learned was strictly from reading. Questions are not welcome.", "i dont like her as a professor. she favors students within the environmental facet of geology over the rest of us. you never get any tests or assignments back and are never given a rheubric to begin with. her powerpoints are boring and the required book is useless. i hated her half of 330.", "Lots of experiance", "Dr. Fressola is one of the best instructors at Bergen. She has high expectations for her students, but makes it clear what is expected. She is one of the few professors that truly lives up to her doctorate in education. One of the only instructors that has the guts to review the exam in front of the entire class. The exams are difficult but fair.", "Very easy professor. Lenient grader, lets you resubmit two of the essays, not a lot of work, had to read three very interesting novels, gives you ample time for assignments. One essay per month. Learned a lot form this professor. Do take her!!", "Horrible Prof. Never knows what she will do each day. Very unorganized. Never hasmarks back until months later. Learned nothing from her...", "Worst Professor Ever! Do NOT TAKE HER CLASS! I repeat do not take her class! Even if you are good in math do not take her class.", "very helpful just hard to understand sometimes. Good teacher just over explains things sometimes. Drops the worst test grade and some homework and quizzes.", "Two things: heavy reading and group projects. Though all of this in preparation for upcoming tests. Again, the course mainly consists of heavy reading, group projects, tests, and observation projects at the NVC Child Development center. Smyle is very lively and is understanding. She is willing to help if you are confused with any of the readings.", "This should have been a fun and interesting class, but Therese Lueck more or less had me think I couldn't write anymore. Fortunately I've regained my confidence and continue writing. Do not take this class.", "Easy class. Just show up and do the work.

Just take notes in class and you don't even need to read the book.", "I think she is a great teacher, but I really felt I shouldnt have placed in 111 in the first place. Total waste of time.

Definitely knows her stuff about advertising and increased my knowledge and interest in the subject. But she is a tough grader.", "O'Shea is an amazing teacher. Really gets into her lectures and captures your interest. It's as if she is telling you a story in class. Four essays. Need the textbook to have successful papers. Tests are easy. Attendance isn't mandatory but go to the review sessions before the test. She basically tells you whats going to be on them. Great class.", "Pretty good prof, midterms are based on the homework&textbook, she doesn't make you do more than that, it's easy to tell what she'll test you on...gives a lot of practical advise but rushes through the class sometimes - she won't kill your GPA I would suggest taking her, don't skip class", "She changed my life.", "Brandie has the highest expectations of any prof I've had at BYU. She makes you earn every single point on tests, papers, and participation. Getting an A from her is a real challenge. BUT she's the best prof I've had. I learned SO MUCH from her and will take every class I can from her in the future. If you really care about your edu, take Brandie", "I took professor Usyk this summer for statistics and honestly can say that I grew and learned a lot during my time in her class. Her lectures are easy to follow and she explains things clearly. She is straightforward with her expectations. Yes, she expects a lot from her students but she also is willing to help if you put in the neccessary effort.", "She was awesome! Doesn't take attendance, but does in class responses randomly. Easy A if you have the notes. Exams you can use a notecard, so it isn't too bad. Plenty of opportunities for extra credit! Would definitely take her again.", "Easily the worst classroom experience I've ever had. She is condescending and rude and seems not to like male students.", "condescending, willing to help at a certain point. Her lectures are very clear and straight forward that is about the only redeeming charactersisitcs, favors certain students over others", "Oh man. I don't know how she got such good ratings.

Highly recommend her", "If you're thinking about taking this professor save yourself a headache and don't! She makes sure that it's impossible you get an A. She lectures EVERY single class, rambles the ENTIRE time. She expects you to talk in discussion to get your participation/attendance grade. Assigns 3-4 ch. plus other readings to do EVERY night. INSANE work for gen ed", "For me, she is introverted professor but she is very warm hearted. So far, I really like to go in her class (because I study, she explains well and the works are always done on time). Her teaching skill is professional. She knows what students need to pass this course. Participate in class, ask to clear sth u dont know and kill the quizes and exam", "I took her telecourse. One of the most difficult classes I've ever taken, the lecture tests were not easy but that wasnt the hard part of it. u had to figure things out on ur own, making an A in her class is not easy, the only class (except for the nursing classes)that I didnt make an A in.", "She sucks, answers all questions with \"read the book\". Subject is boring as hell already and she makes biology worse (didn't think that was possible)!", "If everyone is quiet when she asks questions, there will be a surprise quiz. Read even if you don't understand because, if you ask questions, she will keep explaining in differnet ways until you get it. Do not skip the review day before a test. If you don't do well, go to office hours and ask questions. She's nice if she sees you trying.", "She is an extremely hard grader. She gives out the syllabus at the beginning of the semester and sticks to it pretty well. She doesn't remind you when things are due, just expects you to know. Her classes are fun and interesting if you like acting and theatre. Don't take her class if you are not a serious actor.", "I love love love this teacher. She is very laid back yet she knows her material. She doesn't try 2 sugar coat it she states the facts. There are 2 test they're multiple choice and she your notes are your study guide. This class is very easy if you come and do your notes and simply participate", "Best professor I've ever had!!!!!", "Worst professor I've ever had. Refused to read my paper or answer my questions when I went to office hours and instead sent me to her TA. Absolutely thinks she's GOD and takes herself way too seriously.

Not too bad!", "Very nice and a supportive teacher.", "She is a really nice person, and very responsible.

She's actually a easy marker, but I didn't get the mark I expected, don't know why.", "Lady Sparky is a remarkable professor.\r Her lectures were incredibly lively and informative. Tabby is a brilliant academic whose body of knowledge is quite impressive. Be sure to participate and arrive on time. This is the minium respect you can pay to a lovely lady who has the stunning beauty of Lady Audley and the sharp wit of Sherlock Holmes.", "I'm not even sure if easy is the word for her class. As long as you turn in every assignment and look at the book/notes during the online tests you are basically gaurenteed an A. Also make sure to attend as much as possible that is part of your participation grade. I did everything the day it was due in her class so I'm not joking.", "I took Kathy's photography class in 2000/2001. She was excellent at motivating individuals with photographic art.

She was excellent - Thanks Kathy", "She is patient with me even though my hands fly about on the piano as if unattached from my body.

Provide extra credit and want to pass students", "This teacher offers colleagues and classmates to take time to discuss their literary preferences and campus activity. gREAT writ and teacher. I recommend.", "She is a very easy teacher. The class maybe boring but very imformative. She knows how to teach writing. She is also very understanding if you miss a class. Just don't interupt her class with a cell phone!!!", "Extremely harsh and arbitrary grader. She DOES lie (in this case, about grades)and provides little to no help, despite student requests. Unclear about grading and assignment requirements despite seemingly clear assignment descriptions & syllabus etc.", "No!!! If you are not good in math, don't take her. That's one of those professors who expect you to know everything before you came to class.", "I don't think she was gender-discriminate, but rather had favorites. Class was fine, though she was extremely critical. Best advice--take her lower levels first to get some favoritism before this class. Otherwise, its an uphill battle from the start.", "Professor Malitsky is an excellent teacher for trigonometry. The way she teaches is easy to follow and is and I am able to follow up with the lecture easily in the textbook. She does not take short cuts in demonstrating problems, which I like, because the little math errors are easy to miss with shortcuts.", "Great online class! Prof. Saunders was really nice and super helpful when I had questions. I really recommend taking her class.", "In a history of math classes I've taken Ive never actually received A's of any of my test. She even gave us candy ,DO the extra credit trust me it helps!", "This class is pretty challenging. Consists of 1 group project completed in class, 2 tests, and many homework assignments. Chen is a great professor but the topic is hard to grasp. You must put effort and time in this class to do well. Show up to class, read chapters, and ask questions and you should do okay. Confusing class but it is manageable.", "Idk what everyone is talking about. She's great. Always gave me back all my papers and replied to my emails. If you're leaving a negative comment then that probably means you got a bad grade. Which is obviously your own fault. I got a 98% ;)And it was easy", "Professor Malitsky's lectures are read straight out of the textbook but she doesn't cover everything in the required textbook so, if you go to class, you don't need to read the textbook. I would suggest going to class because she does help with the online homework assignments. Not a bad professor, but her Polish accent takes a while to get used to.", "I love Carla! She emphasizes discussion in class; if you have something to say, she listens. Compassionate grader, and excellent professor who obviously enjoys teaching. Take her class if you can!", "The modules due each week take at least an hour or more to complete, we have online group work in which she expected us to email each other our work back and forth, there is a 9-11 page term paper at the end which is essentially your final, and oh yeah she wrote the book so if you don't word for word repeat the book, your answer wrong.", "I remember reading all the postings before the semester started and promised myself I would not let her scare me off after the 1st day. What everyone is saying is right... SHE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT BYU. I've never been pushed this hard academically (i usually average low B's, high C's). I just got a B on the midterm. If I can do it anyone can!", "great prof! she's energetic and imaginative, i think she could make any lecture bearable if not outright enjoyable.", "Dr. Hall is a professor that you should avoid. I went to her for help and constantly wanted to improve in her class but she didn't care and didn't help me. She is very smart but not so good at getting the info across. Take someone else. Trust me.", "She's a great teacher if you know how to take what she's offering. She picks great stories to read and discusses them more intelligently than any other English professor. She's a little ball of joy and when you talk to her it always rubs off on you.", "She doesnt like getting up early thats for sure but ive never met anyone with as much energy as her in the morning. Hilarious teacher, a must have for your morning wake up computer class.", "Ive never met anyone who UNDERSTANDS acting the way Elizabeth does. She just KNOWS how to make you better at public speaking, acting-related stuff in particular. I really like her emphasis on differentiating between actor and script. She made me feel welcome among a bunch of hostile theater majors even though I was not as talented/important.", "Not open to students opinions, very defensive when spoken against.", "Really awesome teacher. Excellent class, nice model system, basically, everything you'd ever want in a bio class--in one bio class. Now She's my advisor, so the bias is just what it says on the label.", "its 4th grade work that we did but her grading system is terrible. you get points off because youre not putting all the equal signs the way she wants it, or your work is messy, or overly erased, or not placed under the original example, when you should get 100 you end up getting like a 80 because of all the extra points she takes off. yack.", "Avoid her if you want to pass or get a good grade. Her tests are extremely hard and you don't have enough time to deal with them...BTW..she's out there to trick you everytime on the exams and her project is impossible", "Professor Pam is a riot. She is energetic in her lectures, providing thorough explanations to make an interesting topic much more interesting. I didn't go to class the last two months and still got an A. Easy easy A, you can learn a lot if you push yourself and do the expected work. If you don't, you'll still get an A.", "While nice, her class was extremely boring and she mostly read off the Powerpoint. Often times her sentences droned on to nowhere. Not very impressed considering it was a grad school level class.", "Extremely difficult...two major research papers to do in this class, and she won't explain how to do it until after it's done, at which point you've already received a bad grade.", "If you find out that you have her as a professor for either design or drawing you need to immediately request changing classes. She should have retired 20 years ago", "COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN DONT TAKE HER YOULL BE IN A DAZE", "Biochem 2 isn't very difficult. The material isn't hard to grasp and understand (at least to me). If it is for you go to lecture: Saffran's explanations will make this child's play. What makes this course challenging is memorizing reactions. Put the time in and youll also have an A and still be able to recall almost all the reactions a year later.", "She's amazing! I took an express 3 week course for M2 that I was nervous about since math isn't one of my strong suites. But prof Yarmish goes slow and makes everything crystal clear. Very patient and she truly wants all her students not just to pass, but to understand the material for future math courses you may need to take.", "A real Hottie! She may only be here for a few semesters. Languages are hard, she makes it harder.", "Barb is a great prof who is always willing to help you out and answer questions. Let's hope the admin doesn't force her to go the way of a certain OB prof for being \"too lax!\"", "One of the best instructors at Western. Very professional.", "Very nice woman. Projects are fun and easy to complete (IMO). Always there for students, but sometimes to the extent of being a pushover re: due dates and quality like most of Mercer's art courses, critiques are too lax and the quality of work is severely overrated. She is also the advisor for the Graphic Design Club.", "Absolutely the most honest, straight-forward prof I've ever had. Understands the whole work/life balance thing for adult learners. Great prof. You'll love her.", "sarah is a very enthusiastic teacher, and she does let you get your thoughts out, but she really has issues with getting off topic. i get really frustrated with how little we actually end up covering in one class period. i feel that if she could only get her style of teaching more disciplined, she could be great.", "She is the best professor I had to finally help me understand math. I love her teaching style. she doesn't just tell you how to do the problem but explains why something is for what it is. the thing with math is there are sometimes more than one way to do a problem but she tells you her way and explains it well.", "Kate doesn't care what anyone thinks and it's awesome. She a feminist and Buddhist with very strong political opinions she won't see for herself. Class discussions are always fun, If you have a problem with other people's opinions don't take her classes.", "I see most other students were just as unhappy with this instructor as I was. I ended up really sick and emailed this instructor that I needed her to work with me re assignments, etc. after ABSOLUTELY NO REPLY, I dropped the class via web. Not sure if there system glitch, the class didnt drop, she gave me an F and I never even turned anything in!", "I just love her! What a great professor!", "Don't take Early Childhood Education Diploma at Langara College. She is the worst and terrible instructor in the world.", "Gel is very nice. When coming to class make sure you dress appropriately. She tries to make class fun and pushes you to do your best. Work out and stretches along with combinations of jazz. A few handouts at first that you have to read and respond to but after that you just dance. Hard but worth it.=] Good class. you will definetly learn new things", "Assigns a ton of homework, said i'd be able to do my work on my mac if i purchased Office365, which didnt come with 12 the required software for class. her lack of knowledge of current computer software and stubbornness caused me a lot of stress, i ended with a 79.1% getting a C, she did not round up even knowing the extra time i put into class", "I would not recommend Professor Lape to people looking to take an online English course. I'm not sure how she is in a classroom, but online she was confusing, unorganized, late giving back graded assignments, and she did not respond to emails. Better off to just take her in an actual classroom or not at all.", "She's nice but her way of teaching is blah. Everything she does is by the math department. Her answer to everything is literally \"It's on the syllabus.\" If you want to pass and actually understand take another professor.", "Dr. Brown is quite an interesting individual and her class was quite disorganized, with the formatting clarifications and changing of rooms. Fortunately, Dr. Brown's humor and execution made up for it and she is one of the sweetest instructors on the OCC campus. I took her Postmodernism, since a class of mine got cancelled, but I hold no regrets.", "Very easy class. You watch dance films throughout the semester. Her tests are mix and match. She reviews before the test. Don't miss too many classes and definitely don't miss the day of the review. Easy A, lots of extra credit,if you get less than an A in her class, than you have issues. Take her for the new class(Exotic dance-Stripping)in Fall.", "she's great. wants you to succeed. will help you if you ask for extra credit. very good lectures and good study guides. I've followed her for my bio major prereqs. she likes you to be involved in discussion on the topics on the subjects of the day. love the team group testing gives the chance to build up grade. She's best teach ever for psych.", "Not a bad class. The field report took a LOT of time, but the in class assignments helped prepare for it. Each exam covers half the semester. Do the assignments well and turn in on time and you should be gravy. Also the group presentation is a little nerve racking, but not horrible.", "Dr. Rita Sowell is the best teacher I've ever had. I took Calc II and Diff Eq. from her and absolutely loved it...which is saying a lot about her. While she expects you to work hard, she does everything in her power to help you, and sincerely cares about her students. I'm almost sorry for this semester to be over just cause I won't have her again.", "If you want to pass math, under no circumstances take the course with this professor.", "No Comments", "For starters, if you have a heavy classload do not take this class. Between her lab and lecture it was more than the other 3 classes I had combined. BUT if you don't care to do the work and want to learn she is a good one to teach you", "Mrs. Cumpton is the best! She's elegant & classy, extremely competent, & has the sweetest disposition. She's so open to questions & help. I love English, so I loved the class and found it easy, but she challenges you for better writing; brings out your best, & keeps things interesting. She's the reason I love F.Scott Fitzgerald. You'll love her!", "The best in the world. Easy A++++", "OMG Professor Laplaca is the BEST professor at Mercer. Honestly i wish i could take all my adv classes with her. She makes class interesting and involves all the students in activities, class discussions and critiques. I love the class and her as the Professor.", "She was much better than i expected. you must do the reading and study hard, but it will pay off. it is not a class you can slack off in and still get a good grade. but if you do the work you will get a good one AND actually learn a lot. Much happier with this class than anticipated", "VERY LAX IN EXPLAINING WHAT SHE EXPECTED. NO WRITTEN SYLLABUS. SHOWED FAVORITISM. NO TEXT.", "This is the best professor I have ever had! She is extremely knowledgeable and does everything to give that knowledge to her students. Information I learned there has lasted throughout my entire college career. She is a great friend and cares about the lives of her students both in and out of the classroom. Take her class. It will impact your life.", "that was 1 easy class, and she is definitely a fun person and a good teacher - perhaps not perfectly organized... It would have been even more fun if the majority of the class hadn't been such idiots not paying attention, not doing homework or reading the book and then whining about their grade! this is college and it's time to grow up!", "yasmin is sooooo sweet. she actually cares to help AND a day i was sick, i asked a classmate to inform her i couldnt make it, and she actually took time out to email me to say she hopes i get better!! you couldn't ask for a nicer woman.", "She is an amazing instructor, who has much knowledge.", "I went into this class excited because I'm one of those losers that actually likes architectural history. Mourna is the worst professor, if you think you study hard you're wrong. I've never had a class that was as awful as this one and I cried a lot. If you want to talk to the professor she has a pretty interesting life but don't take the class", "Dr. Blanck is a nice teacher but her class is difficult. There is a lot of work and reading for senior seminar. She wants you to learn and cares about her students. She will help you in any way possible to assist you in succeeding", "she's Nice.", "Professor Cardozo is super helpful, and one of the best in English/American Studies to incorporate issues of politics and identity into her coursework. She's super smart, and really sweet. Definitely take a class from her.", "She's deffinatly my favorite ISOM professor. She gets students engaged in class and connects with you one-on-one. Available for help and if you don't understand something, ask and she'll clear things up and bring it to a level thats relatable to you. You have to work for a good grade. Loved the class though.", "No Comments", "She is the sweetest woman who really understands her students and gets that not everyone is interested in sociology but has to take it to graduate. She's easy going and she will work with you as long as you communicate with her. She knows her stuff and she explains it well. She has her own ideas but genuinely hears her students out. Take her!", "I really like Dr. Lorden as a person...however, her class was SO hard! I agree with the fact that she really only wanted to help the people who were doing really well...There were three of us that always studied together, and I would do the worst on the tests, but she would help the other girls more than me?!...Go figure?! But, she is a fun lady!", "No Comments", "She was very caring and enjoyable to be around. You'll be doing class time partially online each week through the series of videos she provides. Some are pretty silly, you'll for sure crack a smile. Each project is challenging in its own way but be wary of going too big with your ideas, it's all very time sensitive.", "She is the best professor I ever had in my life! Great personality and very knowledgeable! Very respectful, professional and helpful. Even if you were not perfect but were working hard she will give you great grade! She is my favorite professor and absolutely recommend her class!!!", "No Comments", "Professor Eisberg is a great professor. She's sweet, nice, and a little quirky. She's genuinly interested in astronomy, which got me interested in it. If you need a class with a lab this is a great one to take.", "Mrs. Gregg is very nice, very thorough. She writes detailed notes on the board to accompany her lectures. I recommend the buying the book, as there is some info on the tests that she doesn't put in the notes. Her tests are bit tricky - multiple choice but still tricky (i.e. one option will be: A & B only, another will be: all of the above)", "She was brilliantly insightful and went out of her way to make her students feel valuable. A difficult class, yes, but untimely useful for future classes.", "The class was too easy and very poor by college standards. I transferred to a better school after being disappointed by how juvenile the course is. The professor, while friendly, comes off too self-centered at times and not very knowledgeable.", "Simply, the best you're gonna get", "Shes very helpful and commited to the subject. Very knowledgeable. Keep up with the readings and your bound to get a good grade. Simple T/F quizzes to keep your grade up, and 2-3 papers during the course. I would recommend this teacher to anyone looking for a fun, interesting history class.", "I took this class online. I loved the program it was in Snap. I knew exactly what was expected of me every week. I do not like the fact that the weeks are locked until current. Sometimes I want to work ahead and cannot. She is totally responsive and very encouraging. She grades fast and is fair. I recommend this class for sure.", "Very useful information learned during class.", "She is the best. She is easy and funny. It s really easy to get an A in this class. There are 2 homework in this class and one project they r easy to do. There r 2 tests and she gives u the study guide for them. I highly recommend her", "Very flamboyant, fun, and direct personality, which I loved. She is very serious about you taking the time to learn, but learning a language is hard and she is preparing you to talk, write, and even sing in Spanish. Attendance is extremely important and I would also recommend doing the extra credit which will help you towards the end to get an A.", "I am in this class now and was dreading taking Eng.Lit. because I don't like to read. The class is run as a discussion group and we are required to write a paragraph or two about what we read and bring one to each class. She lets you know what's expected first class. She is funny and makes class go by fast. I would absolutely reccommend her!", "She has to be the worst professor that I had since I've been here at DeVry. She is definitely a poor excuse for a professor. She is extremely lazy and unreliable, and should not be representing DeVry University. She should be fired!!!! She serve no purpose here besides making students life a living", "Morna's a really sweet old lady but if you don't have a TA in the class then you'll have no idea what's going on or what to expect out of projects. Our TA basically translated everything to us individually after she tried explaining it as a whole. She really is pretty knowledgable about design but she doesn't realize that we don't know anything yet", "Very bouncy,annoying and very demanding.I only lasted one day.For each speech,the student has to decorate a table,a poster and dress the part.It can get expensive.She called to see why I wasn't in class and yelled and lectured me when I told her I dropped it.", "Ugh. I didn't like her. She was confusing and her tests had stuff that she had only brushed over and never explained how to find, only said that it existed. She was a nice person, but even asking her questions in office hours was confusing.", "Sometimes unorganized and boring but seems to be passionate about education.", "She is the BEST professor and one of the most lovely human beings I have ever met.", "I simple adore this prof! She is very easy to reach out of class and is helpful if you get stuck during an exam. Very funny and has study guides for the tests in the coursepack.

If you don't agree with her, you are wrong and will suffer the consequences.", "Tests are easy as long as you study a bit for them. Very helpful. Is funny when she talks to herself in spanish. 'Hola! como estan?' haha", "Great Teacher!!", "No Comments", "She cares about students but I wasn't fond of her teaching. She tended to misinterpret students questions so you'd get a long winded answer to a question you didn't ask. She took attendance but I didn't think lecture was necessary. Homework isn't graded, but preps you for quizzes.", "I had her and loved her. She was so nice and helpful that it made the class interesting. It's a lot of common sense, but you still have to do all the work and study to do well. Just stay on top of things and you should come out of Chen's class with an A!", "Very nice prof, she is very reachable and helpful, very good class notes all online. Both courses were interesting. She is one of the hard working prof", "I was disappointed. She is very sweet, but the quality of her teaching leaves much to be desired. Her lectures were boring and monotonous, rife with historical and geographical errors, yet she was critical and condescending to the students for not being more interested. It's as though she's lost her motivation. She could do better. (I made an A.)", "Sarah is one of the most excited and positive professors i have encountered. Though her classes seem a bit disorganized, she is always willing to see students point of view. Shes a great person to work with outside of class-very helpful. So nice.", "In order to be successful you have to be able to do the work on your own. Her test material come from all over the place and are unpredictable. Her study guides are useless because she do not test what is on them. She is hard to get a hold of and never returns calls or emails. Hybrid course tests are in testing center outside of classtime.", "No Comments", "Dr. Tandy is a sweet lady. This will not safe you however when it comes to passing this class if you don't work for it. Tests are very tough and there is really no time to study since the semester is full of incredibly long HWs, assignments, SUA, outside of class events and activities.

Although she was quite demanding, she was very helpful and interesting, and usually very clear in her asignments and grading.", "Awesome job this past semester. I didn't think I would have fun playing Golf, doing track and field and Archery but I had a blast. Very nice to give us cool T-shirts at the end too. Tests were fair and easy.", "she never responds to emails. its incredibly annoying and frustrating especially when she is grading your papers and is taking her merry time doing it.", "buon giorno sabrina! solid prof. clever style and even better smile...", "her notes are impossible to follow. she writes all over the bored and never finishes a thought. whenever you ask a question regarding an answer on a test, she sayd she'll consider it for next semester. i would not recommend her", "Class was on-line, a 5 week summer session. Not very helpful, responds to emails at her convince. I had to wait a week to review a test, as she was on vacation. 90 min. is not enough time for tests, with depth of work on questions. Better to take the class during a regular semester with a professor who wants you to succeed. Not sure she does.", "This class is really easy does require access code for hw", "She gives you a grade based on your effort. Craftsmanship is first, then design, and materials play some part too, which is bad for you because the cost of materials link to the \"quality\". She buys some supplies so if you're frugal you can get away with spending < $50. She tries to help and talks a lot, with demos, but it ends up boring students.", "She grades on the Final, Midterm, 1 short paper, 1 5 min speech, and attendance. The paper & speech are easy but the tests are tough. She gives study guides but they cover a lot of material. Answers Emails very quickly.", "Very outgoing and makes her classes fun and interesting. Wants all her students to do well.", "When the semester started, I was really put off by Dr. Condit, but my opinion changed. Yes, she's very liberal and yes she can be too vocal about that. However, she has excellent insight into general concepts of politics, and the discussions are valuable. She's also probably the only professor I've had at VCU who really CARES about her students.", "I love Dr. Tenger. She is so funny in class. I don't enjoy literary criticism, but she makes it as interesting as possible. She's also a very lenient grader, and this is one of the easier English courses in the major.", "worst professors in Devry.She lacks teaching skills.There is pretty much no sense in attending the class cause the power presentation handouts is all the teaching that is done.She's always late and stumbles in like she was drinking the whole night before", "This class was pretty boring, and that's hard to do because it was a subject i found very interesting. some days were more interesting, but overall it got pretty mind numbing. at least 50 slides of notes most days, tons of writing... the 10 page paper was hard. not just long, but nothing to write about. i didn't love or hate this class", "It's obvious she has a passion for the material--even if her students do not. She is a good lecturer and really takes an interest in seeing that her students do well--just as long as you make the effort to take advantage of her helpfulness.", "great", "I love this professor!!!!! She is awesome. Definitly take her.", "relates to what you need to know in the real world.", "For the first 2 weeks of class I wondered why I'd read so many negative comments about Fres. However, after that point she showed her true colors. She was frequently aggressive and argumentative when students asked questions. Rather than help in cliinical she demeaned everyone. Unprofessional all around. I got a B+, but give her an F+ for attitude", "Dr Slusher is passionate about her work and nursing as a profession. I have personally enjoyed learning a about h e r experiences. She provides examples pertinent to content she is teaching and encourages class participation enhancing optimal learning. She sets high expectations for student success and accountability which I admire and applaud.", "Without the textbook i would have learned nothing. She does't teach you, she expects you to look everything up. She is a sweet lady, but not a good teacher at all. If you take her, use the textbook to study for tests...not the notes in class...i stopped taking notes cause they're worthless", "She is very unorganized, forgets what she is teaching sometimes & looks confused. I really dont like her teaching style, because she doenst \"teach\". She expects a whole lot, that is expected. a 200-level class she is out of her mind. she really shouldn't be a teacher, she is nice, but doesnt teach well at all. dont take her!!!", "A lot of work for the class. Do not recommend if you're not a THE student already.", "Her projects are very time consuming and she gives a midterm and final paper. This is an art class for God's sake! Just because she was once an english major does'nt mean we need to suffer. Take her class if yiu want a pain up your ass!", "I am now in the \"real world\" of journalism, and I credit her for helping me build the right skills and encouraging me to see that I can be successful in a tough business (I say this 3 yrs later). She is tough, but it's worth it. I'm not sure how she is in telecom, but if it's similar at all, take the class!", "Radhika is awesome. She is one of my favorite profs at the j school. Definately take Race Gender and the Media. It should be required.", "Memorization & regurgitation seem to be paramount. No powerpoints made available. Unrealistic in her expectations. Confusing lecturer.", "American Literature after 1865 is the second of two classes I took with Professor Lape this summer. I greatly enjoyed this class because she helped me grow as a writer. I especially like how she lets students pick the topics of their essays (related to the assigned readings and approved by her). I would reccomend that anyone take a class with her.", "Caring instructor", "Sarah is a great person, and a very easy grader but that doesn't make her a good teacher. Although she did know what she was talking about, she never really passed that knowledge on to the majority of the class. Everything I learned was through my PLA in sections. There was also a huge amount of difficult reading.", "Cynthia expects you to already know the material in class before learning it,and when you ask questions she makes you feel stupid and says you should already know the answer and tells you to ask class members for the answer. very scatterbrained jumps from topic to topic. i learned absolutely nothing from her, i learned more by teaching myself.", "I took Studies in Writing as a required course for English Ed, but this is a creative writing course. Wrote 3 creative papers, which I had never done before. She grades easily and pities you if you aren't a creative writing major. Does not do much during class time besides talk about the books but there are no testsquizzes. Sweet lady.", "Dont listen to the person who said she was bad. Dr. Wall is an excellent teacher who does everything in her power to make you understand what she is talking about.If I could take Dr. Wall for every class I would be very happy. The class is awesome and its fun to boot. Take Dr. Wall, she rocks.", "I never met a teacher that truly cares for their students as much as her. She is always asking for feedback on how she is teaching and if she needs to go over something again. She teachers better than any teacher at Truman and she knows what she is talking about. People fail because they don't put in the work and don't tell her when they need help.", "Gilson is hands down one of the best professors I have taken at OU so far and this class wasn't even for my major/minor. She is so inspirational, hilarious, and down right fantastic. Expect to write (duh) but have tons of fun while doing it! She legitimately made me think I chose the wrong major for myself just because of how interested I became.", "Very ill prepared and scattered professor. Very often goes off on tangents that don't relate to the class. She does not explain even basic concepts in a way that everyone can understand, and instead writes definitions followed by a poor example. If you don't understand after that you're sol. First test had various students with grades below a 10%", "I had Reid for S121 and freshman seminar. Reid was a very understanding and amazing professor. She knew that people got jitters speaking in front of crowds and wouldn't penalize you for it. She could tell who put work into their speech and she would grade accordingly. Always asked questions about your topic and was interested. Great Professor.", "me very hard working student & I take things very serious. She is 2 cold and her way is right way. Her thread discussion is plain useless & WASTE of time 4 every1. I would NOT recommend anyone 2 take her.

I never came to class, never did homework, and I swear she gave me an A for a test I never took. The nicest, quirkiest, funniest old lady you will ever meet. Do not take her if you want to make less than an A. If you do not make an A you need a CAT scan.", "Great professor! Must rent textbook to receive participation points on the online discussions b/c participation grade weighs a lot. She likes to know you are reading the assignments and quoting from the actual book. She does offer extra credit via essay. Only need to write 2 essays for online class APA style. Great at replying back to emails", "Tip: Write down EVERYTHING she says, except for those topics that she repeats over and over (just put a star beside it). I know its a little geeky, but you probably should reread your notes and rewrite them to fully understand. HARD MARKER! You'll be sucessful if you agree wuth her.", "Dr. S is awesome.", "I loved the course I took with Beverly. I definitely got some practical information I could actually use.", "No Comments", "online course had lots of quizes. had to read the book, but teacher was helpful", "Gel is incredible. You will learn life lessons as well as everything about dance. Other professors should take teaching lessons from her. She is one in a million! Love you Gel!", "At first, I thought she was interesting and painfully intelligent. Then I saw the final essay topic (8 of 11 dry, dense theorists into one 10 pg paper) and was no longer a fan. Once I wrote the paper, I realized the point behind the class and the exercise and loved her again. It's not easy, she makes you work and think, but Sparks is a great prof!", "She's kind of annoying with the way she teaches and assigns- it's a little juvenile. But you come out of it really knowing the material, and she really does want to help you.", "She was very strict when it came to class attendance. She made us write a lot of papers. The course material was not interesting. We read long uninteresting articles rather than novels. The articles were in depth and complex. She'll make you work hard, but isn't that hard a grader.", "Definately not the best at NYU, but she knows her material. Yet, she is so nerdy and laughs so much at her own dull jokes that her class is not really what you would call fun. Her quick facts are cool though.", "Don't take this professor.", "It is a huge discredit to CCSU and to Dr. Craine that this woman is allowed to continue teaching. She is horrid both as a teacher and as a person. What goes around comes around and this woman is surrounded by bad karma!", "I don't know what you all are talking about. Rebecca was awesome. I never wanted to take this class but she was so fun and easy going I never wanted to miss a class! She is so down to earth and laid back. I love her!", "Maybe she is different on campus than online. I took 1410 & 1420 online. She did not seem to care or be helpful at all. So far, she is the teacher I am most dissatisfied with. I had a great GPA and made mostly A's before making my first C in her classes. She doesn't seem to have any care that some people work full time.", "She doesnt teach to the whole class, only to about 10 people, she never repeats anything, if you miss it, too bad! You cannot ask a question of the related material, her reply is,\"it's in the book!\". She writes small and God help you if you nee", "WONDERFUL TEACHER.

Great class to take even if never tried acting before. Variety of work assignments.", "unfair and manipulative", "Had to take College Algebra, havent had any Algebra in 7 years.

She even gives you partial credit on the tests for your work, very fair with grading... just dont miss class or you WILL get lost!", "DO NOT TAKE HER FOR AN ONLINE COURSE. I can't speak to her teaching in class, but she is possibly the rudest, inconsiderate online teachers at FIT. Just tells you you're wrong, but not how to fix it. Has no regard or interest in teaching our class WHATSOEVER.", "cant teach", "Rebecca Comay is eloquent and brilliant. Her instruction in the Hegel course got me far beyond my expectation. The bitterness towards her coherence must be from some combination of a reluctance to read and a small vocabulary.", "Feminist teacher, impossible tests, half the class failed...only D that I ever received (and I have a 3.7 GPA!!!!)", "Ms. Nelson is an excellent teacher. I am taking her for an online and her teaching and instructions are very comprehensive. I would have her as a math teacher over anyone else. She has great character and that says alot about a person.", "You could give the best examples of film interpretation in this class, and you grade may hinge above a B. That's if you're a genius. Although the class is easy, and there are 3 essays, aim for a B to B+ because n one gets higher than that.", "Took her voodoo class, that was an experience. She assigns several 3-5 page essays throughout the course an a research paper for a final. She is nice, but a little crazy, she gets very excited about slavery without taking into account the ethnicity of her students. Lectures make an interesting subject incredibly boring. Not my major but got an A.", "good professor~ very helpfull", "okay, true this was a very demanding class. she gives a lot work for you to complished in the semester. I felt very overwhelmed sometimes but she is truly just trying to teach us a lot of material in one semester. she is a very nice lady and keeps you on your toes in class. Im glad I took her but I am also glad that I never have to take her again!", "Amazing teacher, made the subject very interesting and kept everyone awake at 8am!", "I think that she is a very good teacher for speech. I am not sure that some of her views that she might express align correctly with the foundemental beliefs of bryn athyn college. But she did not generally express these views in speech.", "I think one of the pitfalls reviewers of Lair fell into was not going to see her or staying a few minutes after class to ask questions. She looked scary & set tough rules, but when talked to, she relaxed many of the rules & was very helpful. Her class is par for the course, its math & requires work out side of class to pass, o look for it.", "She is an awesome! She is so dedicated to music! She enjoys directing the chorale and that makes the class that much better and that much more interesting! My musical skills became so much better after I began taking her class!", "Very good prof. Explains the material very well.", "This class was really easy. The workload wasn't high AT ALL. I think some people are just too lazy to do a 10 minute assignment before class. She's a very easy grader, and even gives you opportunities to miss assignments without a penalty. You teach the class twice with a group and it's also easy. It doesn't take much planning at all! EASY!!!", "She's weird but she's not hard. I can't say that her class was interesting or I learned a lot, but I can say that her class was definitely not difficult. She's really weird but she can sometimes be interesting. I think some people are judging her too hard on here.", "A lot of reading involved in this class. Essays are kind of long toward the end of the semester, but she is willing to help! Would take again.", "She did not put any grades in the system the ENTIRE semester. I couldn't see how I was doing until the final grade went in, and even then I couldn't see what I did wrong.", "Very long winded lectures. Seemed angry when asked questions. Claimed tests would not be too hard, but required absurd amounts of information memorized.", "This lady has to be one of the worst teachers at DeAnza. You have to be an accomplished writer to get an A. she doesn't teach you anything about writing. and yes you have to think like her and agree with everything that comes out of her mouth.", "online class. work was consistent but not over bearing. i am taking her now for college algebra. good teacher and most of the times understanding about late work and having it extended to complete it", "I took this class during the summer, and it was a breeze! There are three tests and a cumulative final. Dr. Williams is funny, enthusiastic, and always has a smile on her face. She gave us fifteen minute breaks between lecture and film presentations and allowed us to eat during the films. If you're looking to knock out a fine arts credit take her!!", "Beverly was extremely helpful and had a lot of practical advice. I will actually use what I learned in her class, which certainly isn't the case with all RTC courses.", "ugh, shes a smart lady but arrogant. She talks to you like you're dumb when you ask a question. She contradicts the textbook on the tests. Cancels classes and you pretty much have to teach yourself everything, but you'll still be wrong. DONT take if it's an elective. You'll most likely be stuck with her, so good luck.", "Ms. Everage is the most helpful, sweet woman. I had to take college algebra and i am not a math person so the material was so difficult for me to grasp. I went to her office hours so many times and she was so determined for me to pass the class. GREAT teacher and person in general. You are lucky if you get her as a teacher.", "If you are at all serious about learning health and sanitation, Yearwood is the gal for you.

DON'T: Take this class if you just need to pass because you must work very hard.", "Dr Fressola was tough but a great clinical instructor. She didn't make it easy but she respected that we were students and would tell us if we were making mistakes. She was very good about being professional when telling you about mistakes. She always had you step off the floor for comments. I learned a lot from her and I am very thankful.", "Very nice professor that offers LOTS of extra credit, even free points on tests (ie. \"just mark A\"). If you're struggling, which shouldn't happen much, she is very accessible for office hours and gets back to you frequently on emails. Topics are also interesting and easy to learn also it's just music and learning to appreciate it. Fantastic class", "Dr. Williams is awesome and made this class very fun and worthwhile. I was required to take this class and wasn't very interested in it, but Dr. Williams made it a great experience.", "She teaches straight from the book but she will go over it in class before you attempt it just in case the book was not clear enough. the actual class and material were easy and she simplified it even more. Great Teacher.", "Dr. Long is one of the most engaging professors at Fairmont State. She always has a smile on her face and knows how to enjoy a laugh. But on the serious side, I honestly believe that she should be in the public school system to catch some people before they slip through the cracks or before they get to college. I can't think of a better role model.", "Best Senior Course out there. There is a lot required of you (reading, watching films, etc.) but none of it is wasted time. The midterm and final projects are difficult, but nothing you wouldn't expect. She is open and willing to help you with your writing, and you'll become a better writer from taking her class. AMAZING professor. Beautiful class!", "Her guidelines for assignments don't match how she marks papers. Doesn't have any powerpoint presentations because all she does is talk. WE GO TO AN ART SCHOOL.

Very easy, and very easygoing.", "Mrs. Martin is approachable and supportive if you are struggling or challenged by utilizing computer systems.", "Therese deals in the study of marginalized voices--the views and experiences NOT heard in popular education.

She is awesome.", "Easy A. So easy I didn't learn much. Participate and get an A.", "Digital photo 7. Great professor! She explains everything crystal clear for you. Exams are easy if you do your work. Show up, do your work, and you will get a good grade.", "Very dynamic teacher!", "Boring class. Ease up on the grading too. I put 715 B.C. and got points off cause it was 710 B.C.", "Dr. Dunn is an AMAZING professor! She wont give you the class on a silver platter, but when all is said and done you will be very grateful. Heres a hint: she emails the slideshows to you, so take notes on what she says, not whats on the slide. Also, make sure you ask questions! It will help you remember! I promise", "i loved the class i took with her and i thought she was a great teacher.", "Great teacher. Her lectures can be long but she is very clear about the subject. you dont have to buy the book, she explains all the concepts that you are expected to know in class. She made the class quite interesting. Recommended.", "She's knows her stuff but I did not enjoy having her as my professor. She is rude. I could have made a better grade if I had known how to study. The questions in the back of the Fundamentals of Nursing book were helpful but you do best by studying the powerpoints. 1st test was mainly over the syllabus... Be sure to study.", "This woman is so strange. She missed so many classes that it was ridiculous. We spent the entire semester studying Lacan, but I don't remember a bit of it. Somehow I pulled an A and a B+ on my papers, even though I had absolutely no idea what I was talking about.", "she's very cool. very funny. and will always help you when you need it. the class is boring for me, since all we do is talk about the books we're reading, but she's still very interesting to listen to at times. she's a funny old lady. :)", "I had to dance the nutcracker in front of the whole class. If I didn't she was going to take away points!! We had to take selfies with strangers in public! Basically we did a ton of stupid stuff that had no relation to psychology. She said we won't need a book, then test time comes and she says, \"Read your chapters!\" She never taught us anything.", "She is absolutely the best math teacher i've ever had. I have always struggled with math. And with her help i passed the class.", "Very good teacher, fun class to take.", "I agree she is a wack job. When I had her she made us have study buddies and thats what we had to do for the beginning of every class. We got in trouble is we werent studying. However her grading is very easy as long as you follow intrusctions", "BEST CLASS EVER! Tests are easy if you study your ass off, but it's worth it. Be prepared to start studying a week before the midterm and final. Other than that Shaw makes this class fun, interesting, and worthwhile. Attendance is necessary, but class is so interesting that you will want to be there.", "She is a bitter professor. Not happy with anything you do, but does not give you enough help to do good.", "Worst professor I ever had. She clearly needs to re-think her teaching methods, but she wont, because she is stubborn. Iftode, if you are reading this, consider your rating compared to other professors on this site, and re-think your teaching methods, because they don't work.", "I don't know why people are so bitter towards this prof, she's actually great. Gave out 3% in free bonus marks to basically everyone. The midterm on the syllabus said chapters 1-7, she made it easier by only covering chapters 2,3,4, and 7. I studied total 12 hrs for midterm and got an A. Content on tests were directly from textbook and lectures.", "I LOVED this class. No, it is not an A handed to you, yes, you do have to work, and wake up, its COLLEGE!\r \r Professor Murphy-Lee is always enthusiastic about her subject. Sometimes it gets boring, because the class moves too slowly for people who know history already.\r \r Easy if you do the work. Honors section easy as all get out! Do it for cr", "No Comments", "I took the class because I am going into a research based career. It is very informative and helpful toward that goal, but the professor doesn't respond to emails. It sort of frustrating as you start to do the 15 page paper at the end of the class.", "Gel is a wonderful teacher. She knows a lot about dance and the theater world and she is always telling stories about famous people she knows. She may come across as mean at first but once you get to working with her she is actually very nice and a great teacher. I recommend taking a dance class with her!", "Liberal feminist teaching in one of the most Conservative places in the country. She is interesting and if you OPEN YOUR MIND you will leave enlightened and changed. Unapologetic, and sometimes frightening. She is serious but has a good sense of humor. Class consists of powerpoints, lecture and note taking. Easy class IF you pay attention.", "While the content she lectures on is very interesting and done well. You will struggle to meet seemingly arbitrary expectations on the essay tests. Then as a added bonus, your class will receive a lecture in broken English on how bad your English skills are. The novelty of these occurrences fades quickly. I would not recommend this course.", "Iftode is a good teacher as long as you have some sort of background in genetics. If you have a solid background, I would recommend taking this class. If not, go elsewhere. Her blackboard is confusing and due dates are never really clear. She is really nice and when you ask her for help she is very helpful.", "odabashian gave me a B; she sucks", "Pro. Hilton was SO interesting in her lectures, when i transfered my english teacher was lame compaired to her.

She is very helpful,nice,fun", "Very nice and extremely funny show for class and ask questions will give you a easy A on participation, and take notes very helpful on exams don't buy all the book needed some of the stories are online so you can just print them and exams a pretty easy if you pay attention in class, which you will cause she is so much fun!!!", "I thought this class was REALLY easy. Yes, the essays can be graded hard depending on your TA. She is too perky for me, but at least she knows what she's talking about. Just go to class and you'll do fine.", "Professor Giampetro is the one of the top two professors at Loyola! She makes the class fun to learn, and makes the entire class excited for each and every class. She also has an understanding that most graduate students are busy outside of the classroom. Also great feedback!", "Great lady but puts a lot of your grade on attendance, the class is super easy and fun", "Dr. Lenczewski is one of my favorite professors. She gives power point lectures in class that are fun and very easy to understand. 3 exams with an optional final.

She keeps class super interesting and has lots of extra credit opportunities.", "****!!!!!!", "SHE IS NEVER SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING SHE WANTS THE IN CLASS ESSAYS TO BE PERFECT, IF SHE WANTS IT TO PERFECT MIGHT AS WELL GIVE THEM IN HOME ESSAYS.

Didn't hear her belittling anyone, answered all the questions, test are absolutely doable. She has a terrific work ethic and taught me to think as a nurse - priceless - worth some of the stress", "expects students to have learned the material before she teaches it...she does not spoon feed but she also does not explain it herself...not very effective for most poeple. a majority of the classwork(online, quizes, work)is doen by yourself and at home or online...", "Alison is a great teacher. I would recommend her for any baking/pastry class. She is a real Chef with real experience.", "Listen in class, it really helps!", "Hard class if you hate theory.

If you need this class and want to succeed - take her as your teacher.", "I loved Dr. Huntley's classes. I always looked for the classes she taught because I knew they would be interesting and easy as long as I applied myself. I highly recommend.", "TERRIBLE class. Everyone I knew made a C or lower. It's by far the most boring clas you will ever go to. I LOVE art, but after this class, I rethought my art major.", "This class was pretty difficult and Dr. Hall was not much help. The text book is impossible to understand. Dr. Hall is very smart but doesn't have any people skills at all.

She will also tell us to not be scared to ask her questions but when you ask her questions she will explode and no answer your question.", "Dr. Mcfadden is an excellent professor. She goes out of her way to ensure students learn the material. The cases in this class helps with real world application. There is a team research paper that further enhances your learning. There are 2 tests and one non-cumulative final. An \"A\" is attainable but you must work for it. Overall A+ Professor", "The first half of the semester is on book material and the second half is doing a confusing as hell group project - it did not help that she missed so many days of class. The tests are somewhat difficult but if you read the book you should be good to go. Make sure to ask her questions outside of class because her instructions are often vague.", "The MOST unprofessional professor I've ever had the misfortune to encounter!", "Definitely take her class for ENG 095. As long as you attend class, do your work and polite to her, she will love you. Papers are only a page long and your final is a group project. Easy A", "I have anxiety issues, and I was afraid of online classes. Ms. Sailors gave me her phone number and let me text/call with issues during regular workday hours.

I believe i learned a great deal in this class.", "OLGA WAS A WICKED AWESOME TEACHER!! I WAS BLESSED TO BE TAUGHT BY HER!! SHE IS JUST SO INTELLIGENT!!!", "Very clear lectures, she is amazing!!!!", "perfect teaching", "Hmm, I'm not really sure how I felt about this teacher. Some days I liked her and others I didn't. She requires you to buy like 10 books for her class and you go through one a week. Class is just a discussion on what you read. If you like reading and talking out loud take this class. However I did not say a single word and still passed with a C", "Excellent", "She is easy, but grades harder than you think. She is old and rather slow, but makes the class fun. I enjoyed her class but expected a better grade than what I got.", "unclear, moody, should be teaching grade school. tries to mold students opinions to fit hers. site is completly unorganized. tons of pointless work. this is an analytical class but you'll be writing informational papers and learning elementary grammar. i've never disliked a class so much: awful. :(", "Moore is a pretty decent teacher, she helps and gives a lot of example during class if you're confused. Her test are a bit of a struggle and the homework and quizzes are all online. She does five of a ton of extra credit but make sure you don't wait till the last minute. All in all she wasn't too bad, I'm horrible at math and she helped me pass.", "Really good teacher, always tries her best to help and takes all her time to do so. Unlike several other teachers, she explains elaborately and her notes are so beneficial. Would take another class with her if I can.

She makes very effort to ensure that you enjoy her classes!", "Glenda Williams is an adviser for the TCF department. She is not in on mondays and fridays, which is terrible! Even during registration she will be out of her office on those days. TCF department is severely slacking with this!", "Uses intimidation to control students.

There are much better teachers at the school.", "No Comments", "Lots of book reading but not much else.", "Some don't like her style. I'm one of those people who thought her class was great.

To", "For the sake of your sanity, do not take this class unless you have a painful passion for memorizing 600 paintings (and their artists) for 3 in-class exams. Extra credit is generous but staying awake in lectures is grueling. As a Finance major, there was nothing interesting about the class and I don't recommend it for analytical people.", "Mrs. Johnson is a wonderful teacher, one of the best I have ever had. She genuinely cares about the success of her students and wants them to do good. She is more than willing to help when a student needs extra help. She tries to teach each lesson several different ways because everyone learns differently. HIGHLY recommend this teacher!", "Her lectures are excellent, among the best I've ever attended as they are very clear. However, she is something of a brutal marker, and her final exam requires coverage of large amounts of course material in a very limited space. She is also rather cold in person, as if she has no time for you. This discourages you from asking for help.", "She was a terrible teacher. If you call her Mrs. instead of Dr. she chews you out. She would post our questions online only 2 hours before class. She was not willing to help anyone with anything. I would avoid her if at all possible.", "I can't say whether Prof Mitchell knows her stuff or not; she just posted the same cookie-cutter material used in every gen psych class. But do NOT expect her to work with you in an emergency, and do not expect any kind of feedback. At all.", "Mrs. Haynie is probably one of my favorite professors in life. She is still, to this day, a good friend and a mentor to me. I love her and her classes were awesome.", "yikes!", "Kathy Haddad is one of the best professors at Chaffey College. She is so sweet and truly cares for her students. This class is not hard, just do your weekly readings in the textbook (usually about 20 pages) and take the quizzes every week. Two short research papers- very easy and some discussion forums, which were very minimal. 10/10 recommend!!", "Really is not a process oriented teacher at all.

All work was clear, lots of films and group projects . Never boring!", "Lets TA's do all the work. Not very helpful to students.", "One of the coolest professors I've ever seen. PHIL is not my thing but I took her PHIL101 for GE purposes. Her class does NOT have any exam including final. There are about 3-4 essays that are fairly easy. They have deadlines but u can turn in anytime u want without getting any penalty. She grades not hard too. 100% recommend to her class.", "This is the best math professor I've ever had. I had to take this class because I failed mat1033 three times, that's how bad I was doing at math. Now I got an A on her class.

She made class interesting and always let us leave early as long as we finished the assignments given", "Lectures are really clear, but she is a horrible marker.

My advice choose another professor!!!", "Wonderful teacher! Def the best at Vol State. Very helpful and amazingly nice to everyone", "She's the sweetest, most caring professor you'll encounter. Her passion for the material is infectious and she always tries to make tutorials interesting. Readings are mandatory in this class; in fact the tutorials are more important than lecture. She's clear on expectations but not an easy ride. Mima is a gold standard professor.", "I think making us go to the cemetery and \"observe\" froze my ass off, not to mention creeped me out. I spent hours on her assignments when I could have taken a much easier course.

She's obnoxious and loud, which can be cool but only in moderation. Sitting through an hour and a half class twice a week was a bit too much of Shelly for me.", "loved the class", "I really liked Prof. Dogru and enjoyed her class.

Not all that hard of a class, I really learned alot though.", "She gives a lot of work and made me hate writing method sections. I changed my major after having her, but I can't blame her entirely.

Would not recommend taking her one day a week class unless you have to take it", "Pay attention in class or get notes from a friend and you'll do fine. There are in class quizzes at the end, but you can use notes. 3 tests, 2 concerts and 1 project all easy to get A's on. She is helpful if you email her or talk to her after class. Boring class, but super easy A.", "Nice, friendly, understanding, and interesting", "Probably the nicest lady you will ever meet, not to mention one of the funniest. Her lectures are simple, and she goes pretty quickly but stops if anyone has questions, or if she notices people are confused, and sometimes stays after class to offer extra help. The midterm and finally are easy, and if you understand the assignments you'll be fine.", "Not so good.", "He is extremely bad teacher. I thinks that he knows everything and we (the students) are ignorant. I would not recommend this teacher evne if he was the last one that i need for graduate with my bachelor degree.", "good teacher", "She's very particular about the topics and views she wants to read in the student's papers, if she doesn't like it then she seems to keep the grade low. She can be nice as a person but a tad boring as a teacher in this class-going over grammar rules instead of how to write a good essay.", "boring and confusing lectures and not friendly when you go to office hours. unavailable to student's needs unless you are a \"chosen one\" that she likes", "Dr. Spievak is a nice person, but as a professor I would never take a class with her again. Cognitive psych was a nightmare. She assigns long, dry readings for EVERY single class, and you may/may not have a quiz on every single reading or class period. No powerpoints, just speaks what you need to know. Very hard grader, never satisfied.", "If you at least attempt all of the homework, you'll do fine in Dr. Sowell's class. The start of each class will be spent going over homework and this is where most of the learning takes place IMO. As a teacher she was fair, respectful, and very accessible to all of us. My only complaint is that we ran out of time near the end and had to rush.", "Mrs. Benston was the best professor I've ever had (Undergrad and Grad school). I keep the journals she made us write (all 89 pages with notes) and once in a while will read through her comments. She is one of the most intelligent and caring individuals I've ever encountered. I think of her often now that I'm also a teacher.", "Terrible communicator. She does not respond to emails and when she does,she is short almost annoyed you even asked. She does not do any grading AT ALL. The computer does all the grading and she does not check over to see even if that is correct. We were given extra credit assignments and she did not even include them in the final grade. Terrible!!!", "She is a wonderful teacher. She makes everything crystal clear and always returns email. I am taking her online.I see her once a week with any questions I have a she has helped me. All you have to do is cc and 4 tests. At the end of the semester you can retake the lowest test so you make a better grade and do the extra credit that she gives.", "This was a online class, you do all your work & tests at home(except final)If you ever needed help Ms Sowell would work problems for you or offer to meet you online. She seems real nice and I would take her class!", "I finished her class, and I am very disappointed about her class. I can say that there is nothing, except that reading her confusing lectures, watching videos on YouTube, and doing her tough homeworks. Be careful to read her long assignments because she is a tough grader, and she won't help you at all.", "Dr. Manas is probably one of the best professors I've had. She actually expects us to, you know, learn and apply things. Her classes are extremely complex, but genuinely cares about her students and wants them to understand the material.", "Easy A", "She is awesome. She actually cares about her students. Her Exams are not hard and she offer so much extra credit its almost impossible to not pass. Easy A for sure TAKE HER", "I lover her. She's very interested in what she's going, and when we have group discussions she sometimes sits with us and just talks to us like regular people. I really recommend her, she's a great person.", "She was awsome and by far the easiest and best professor ive had at uab!", "Incredible woman with such a large heart and lots of stories. I loved talking to her and miss presence here a lot. She really helps you understand the texts with all of her background information and makes lectures interesting. Hopefully she'll be back in Spring 06.", "She seems very on organized imformation on speeches is all over between the internet and the handouts. I often got marked off for not using the write bullet points. Easy class though but don't recommend it."], "male": ["Inspirational teacher! He is there for you, if you need help don't be afraid just ask! expects you to try in class and on your assignments. Do not take his class for granted you will learn to pick out your own mistakes overtime :)", "In order to succeed in this class, you must do the homework and read the chapters (at least glance the vocabulary). The exams are exactly like the study guides he gives with a few tricky/thinking questions. He also provides tutoring sessions in case a student has trouble in this class.", "Professor Brooks is a character. I had him for both Bio-principals and Biodiversity. Attend every lecture, read the lecture notebook before class and you'll do fine. His exams aren't too difficult, and in my opinion were pretty direct. His lectures are enjoyable but beware he's very strict: no phones, no laptops, no technology whatsoever.", "Hupp is an AMAZING teacher. He is very interactive and loves what he does. His power points are very easy to understand as long as you attend class when he goes over them. Test are easy and over what he has talked about. attendance is not mandatory but he doesnt put the power points on blackboard.", "If you enjoy watching youtube videos and only do 2 papers (4-5 pages) and 1 presentation for the whole year then this class is for you, an easy A. Those are the ONLY assignments you will get in the class.", "So... He is the most confusing person I've ever heard speak. However, he can be so helpful if you JUST ASK FOR HELP. I really encourage going to office hours, they help a lot. And he really is a really great guy. You have to learn when to stop paying attention when it stops making sense.", "somewhat boring but has his random funny times which you dont expect and hes super nice to talk to. you learn a lot in this class and the tests/exams are really easy. good class overall", "He is probably one of the worst professors I've had. He's horrible at explaining what will be on the test, spends the entire class period just doing examples but never fully explains the subject. This class should have been easy, and all of my friends who have a different professor are doing good, but because he's a bad teacher I'm not doing well.", "he's a cute little dude, and he's crazy about economics. the first test was really easy but the last few got pretty difficult. i felt like the notes didn't really relate to the exams but he does offer some helpful pre-exams on line.", "Briggs is an excellent teacher and keeps everyone in the class motivated. Take Tai Chi. Not only do you learn the technique, but insiteful points on the history of it. Also a great guy to hang out with and ask for advice.", "He uses the Canadian Grading scale... need I say more?", "Very boring, liked to hear himself talk, took attendance, but assignments were easy and he was well organized.", "Excellent teacher. He is highly recommended.", "Best professor at WC. Some of these reviews have been written by morons clouded by ideology. That's exactly what PK avoids best, and his calm, collected manner opens your mind to a world of thought beyond what you can prepare for. He's so brilliant that he illuminated Hegel, one of the worst writers of all time, with absolute clarity. Reading is intense, but not overly demanding. Very good about assigning only sections that were essential. Take Paul K, especially 19th Cent Phil, even if your only PH class.", "This teacher was very passive-aggressive and picked favorites. Overall, his class was not a good experience.", "ugh..this class is gay... damn requirements!", "KWAG is amazing, one of the best classes. Go to class and pay attention and you will definitely easily get an A. Tells literally everything that's going to be on the midterm and finals", "His exams are fair- half multiple choice and half long answer, and he gives partial credit even if you mess up. I didn't do a whole lot of work and I still almost got a B-, so try and it's an easy course.", "By far one of the best professors I've ever had. He doesn't give busy work and he consistently checks to make sure that you're understanding the materials. Great Professor, Highly recommend.", "HOTTIE!!! HOTTIE!!! HOTTIE!!! I sat there the entire semester dreaming about him... anyways... stat is easy for me, so that gave me plenty of time to day dream. And i got an A. I'll say it again!!! HOTTIE!!! HOTTIE!!! HOTTIE!!!", "expectations are too high but he marks easy and is fair", "He is a terrible professor, and his grading system make almost every students in his class to get F. You will never get 100 from his project, he will take off 33% of your grade by saying you do not meet Design requirement(which he make it on his own term). Crazy professor. STAY AWAY !", "There are 4 tests - 100% free response to a rather vague set of questions. It's almost all lecture, so you must attend class if you want an A. Outlines, lectures, and many aids are on Blackboard. This is not a blow off class, you must work hard if you want an A. Good instructor though, very clear on what he wants, and offers EC at end of semester.", "great teacher", "he makes the class way harder than it has to be....if u think u are going to learn history you are dead wrong. this might as well be call philosophical history than history. a lot of reading....but on the plus we does clarify very well, helps you out anytime and keeps you moderately interested.", "I think Eberts is really knowledgeable but NOT very approachable. His tests arent bad but he doesnt really help you out at all with notes, since he basically just talks about pictures. I also dont like his comments about people leaving his class, what if there's an emergency?!? and why do you care?? its not your problem if they dont wanna learn.", "For the first test I was furious, I studied hard, read all assignments got barely C. I found what he is looking for, I got A. Pay attention what he said \" this will be in test\" or \" on the test I want you to draw the diagram\". He said those when students having hot debate. I did all the extra credits (3).Ask questions, be prepared, be creative.", "great teacher!!", "Heavy russian accent. very helpful. Open book, open note tests. Sometimes even able to cheat if you wanted. He knows his stuff, tests are a bit hard though.", "Horrible professor. Tests are irrelevant to material discussed in class and picks one-liners from the textbook that aren't important. WOULD NOT discuss this course.", "Danny Fon is a great teacher. If you go see him in office hours, he will give you the answers to the homework. Final is not cumulative. I would recommend taking him.", "Hard to understand with his accent. Lectures were tough I passed with a B+ even with his review sheets. Really nice guy though! Just not recommended unless you know Math.", "This is a hard class but Dr. Jurs isn't a bad teacher. The information being taught is diffucult to understand as well as being a lot at one time.", "A tough instructor but THE BEST ONE! Other istructors at this school don't really teach you--they don't tell you what to do to fix a project or improve something. I got great advice on how to improve my projects. I really learned in this class.", "Preston rocks my world! Totally intelligent, funny, engaging and involved teacher - The university is lucky to have him!", "Christian is awesome! The best prof that I have had here at UBC so far! Very helpful, great class, fun and interesting lectures. He is very fair, and doesn?t like conventional teaching methods, rather he will teach you why something is the way it is. Thanks Christian, loved your class!", "Thought he was great, will take his class anytime. Very helpful if you know why you are in the class.

Got an A.", "This class requires alot of self teaching. I liked the class and the group that I was assigned to. YOU MUST GO TO CLASS!! He does in class clicker questions that are graded. He responded to questions very quickly. READ THE BOOK!! Make sure you know your stuff, because its up to you to learn the material. He doesn't lecture in class at all.", "No Comments", "This class is ridiculously hard. With that in mind, he tries to make it understandable. The accent makes class worth going to.. he's a fun guy. The homeworks and tests are completely brutal, though...", "He's hilarious man. I enjoyed attending his classes. I highly recommend him for non-bio majors.", "great professor. crazy hard", "Prof Wernli makes it really hard to make a bad grade in his class. He's very clear on what will be on his exams and gives many quizzes of which he keeps only the top 10 grades. He will bend over backwards to help you if you just ask. Attend class and study. I made an A. Very nice man, sweet and young at heart. :)", "Dr. Terry is thorough and thought provoking. You cover a good deal of ground in corporate finance in \"adv fin mgmt\". While the earlier courses are a little too easy, this course is really excellent. This course makes heavy use of case studies, an excellent immersive tool. Best time to ask him questions is during or after class.", "Will never let out early. Loves the subject. Kinda nerdy. Lectures are dry. Lecture quiz during lab every other week.", "This teacher seems to be very impressed with himself & discourages independent thinking. Write papers the way he wants you to write them & you will do fine. Also, seems to find humour in humiliating students. This I find unexcusable behavior in a professional. Needs to reevaluate teaching style.", "If you don't think that Baude is the smartest person you've ever met. You've either met Socrates or you can't recognize genius when you see it.

Quizzes usually 5 questions, and you only have 30 seconds to answer before he moves on. I read and understood all chapters and sections, and worked problems at the end of the book.

But HARD grader", "I wish he was as accurate with figuring grades as he is with language. thanks.", "Dr. Fisher was a great professor. I liked his lectures, he tried to keep it interesting, and sometimes he'll share a scrap of his personal life. He tries to answer any questions during a lecture. I never used office hours, but I knew they were available. His tests aren't bad compared to other bio professors. Bio is just a hard course overall.", "I generally love all my teachers because I check them on here. This teacher, however, was extremely inappropriate. He made jokes about handicapped kids the first day. He spent at least two months looking at uncovered people, mostly women and even admitted to going to an adult site for some of his material. Won't take again.", "He's a good teacher. He really cares about everyone he's teaching and gives over some valuable life skills and tips. He's also very interesting teacher. funny.", "This class is fantastic!! By far one of my favorites. Professor Damen get really into his lectures, it GREAT, and he is always very helpful. If you study and do the work you will pass no sweat, only thing to watch out for are the essays. He is very picky about the essays andif you have to reprint it, it 25% off automatically. So BE CAREFUL.", "He's a good teacher but there isn't enough time to study for that much information when you have family and kids he's really critical on studying and test aren't what you think you don't really know where the exam is coming from he doesn't give reviews or study guides", "One of the best teachers. I am a total retard when it comes to Math, but I got an A at the end.", "Gerry is seriously, my favorite teach ever. If you don't like him, it's probably because you're kind of boring and lamecity. I was not a particularly great student, Gerry grades very harshly, but he was very encouraging and personable. I got many bunk grades in his class, but that's because I was kind of a **** up. In my opinion, he knows what'", "Very easy to understand. He had some great in-class demonstrations too. The only things that bugged me were the clickers for attendance.

He is funny and SUPER UNDERSTANDING. One time I got an answer wrong on a quiz and I gave him an explanation as to why I chose that specific answer, and he liked my explanation, and said that he would add that point back on. He is eager to help and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking his class. Wish I could take his class again.", "Took Mr. Hu's summer school course. He was awesome! Explains everything in detail. He is well organized and goes over things that way you definitely absorb the information. I would take him again!", "This class probably gave me the most anxiety. I was literally shaking before each evaluation. This class is composed of 4 quizzes. Final is 35%. Prof Kraay is definitely one of the best profs at Ryerson. My anxiety probably had to do with the fact that I was a 1st year student at that time but it also did not help having the lecture Friday evenings", "-", "Corvino was an excellent lecturer. He kept the class engaged and interesting. Definitely read the course pack and participate in class. Discussion portion seemed a bit pointless to me sometimes however the lecture itself was wonderful. Exam questions were confusing and tricky at time but the workload is not much!", "The tests are word for word, 100% the practice test. They are the exact same thing. Just memorize it. Lectures are boring and he makes a lot of mistakes on the board. You can 100% snooze through lecture, be there for the quizzes, and memorize the practice test and be fine. Very boring.", "Cross-listed as EnglishC77 & UGIS12; co-taught by Prof. Hass.

Very tough subject (Calc 2) - he's got a clue.", "no good,", "Mr. Foster is hands down the best teacher out there. He teaches you the course in a way you don't want to miss any of his lectures. Never did I find his lectures to be boring. Extremely nice and very knowledgable. He is the only teacher that explained marketing so well to me.", "This class was one of my favorites and Dr. Hupp has been one of my favorite professors. As long as you attend class, take good notes and study for the tests you will get an A. Should definitely take Dr. Hupp, he is a fantastic professor and is really funny", "Brother Zenger is great at teaching, but I was surprised by his disinterest in the class. I would suggest taking another teacher who will be more invested in their lower level classes. I felt like we didn't learn near as much as we could have because he was more concerned with his higher level classes.", "His voice just isn't that interesting, and he seems to daydream into space a lot. I found myself getting distracted because I couldn't focus on what he was teaching. The subject itself is pretty complex and therefore I personally need an enthusiastic funny teacher, especially in the morning.", "Doesn't really care about the course. Asks terrible questions on the tests that are completely ambiguous- asks T/F questions on opinionated topics. Says he'll curve final grades, but didn't for our class. Just a terrible course overall, don't take it if you don't have to.", "Horrible class!!!! You only were graded on 2 test and a paper. Both the test were essays and the paper had to be at least 10 pages long and that doesn't include the foot notes or resource page. He was a hard grader and he had his favorites in the class.

At $300 a student hour he should be ashamed!", "The class is easy, you can learn by yourself without spending more money in this semester", "Pretty good prof. Doesn't take attendance or anything. If you read the books the quizzes are super easy. The class discussions were very interesting. Coming from somebody who doesn't read or favor English too much I enjoyed the class a lot.", "He is not very good at explaining things, but the workbook is very clear so that's all you need. I didn't pay attention hardly at all, but you'll do fine as long as you study a lot before the tests. If you're going to take this class, take the honors version with him!", "Nobody knows what he wants to teach in this class. There is no syllabus, no grading information, no battle plan to attack the class. His lectures are boring, and his sense of humor is lacking and annoying. His final is straightforward but no one knows how he grades and how he came up with his inconsistent grades. I will avoid him", "First, don't be late. Second, remember to take notes. Questions on the exams are based on his notes. 1 short term paper and 1 freakin' easy map test. HOWEVER, the mid-term and the final exam are so difficult and tricky ... He's nice and gentle with a little bit accent of Polish. You'll pass his class but won't be able to get a high grade like A", "This \"professor\" has no concept of how to teach a class. I should have read the warning signs. He waits until the refund date for classes to actually assign homework, his list of specifications took a full minute just to scroll through. He double deducts points because he lists them in different ways. DO NOT TAKE. He enjoys taking points off.", "Dr. Gallaher is a fantastic teacher and truly cares about the success of his students.

He is most definitely the best English teacher I've met in my collegiate career and I'm glad I had a chance to take Comp. 2 with him.", "I had no real complaints about MacKinnon. He was a really easy marker which was a definate plus and he was fairly easy to talk to. He'd be a great professor for someone just taking a Politics course to fill their schedule.

He is EXTREMELY talented and is the best choral conductor i've ever met.", "Dr. Ballard is a very interesting person; he plays devil's advocate with you a lot. The HEA 290 class wasn't too hard with him. He seems to become self-absorbed in his own ideals in lecture at times. The tests are multiple choice and short answer, usually making flash cards over content is fine for studying. You have to work, but not too hard.", "Nice guy. Works with you if you have a problem. I dislike psychology, but really enjoyed Mr. T's class.", "He is the worst professor ever!!! He is unfair, and rather talk about his personal life than actually teaching the class. I spent so much time reading, homework, threaded discussions, Q&A , i always completed everthing at 100% and he still gave me grades according to how he felt. He is an awful teacher, dont waste ur time, money and stress by takin", "Awful -moody and plays favorites.", "No exaggeration when I say Mr Hu is one of the best teachers I've had. Calc3 is not easy and it covers many topics, yet I was able to work the hw based almost entirely on what I learned in lecture. He's engaging, caring, hilarious, and approachable.

Expect to teach yourself. Office hours always packed. He accuses you of skipping class and looks at you like your an idiot when you ask questions to clarify his confusing lectures. Only professor I've seen yell at a student or call them a liar. A is possible, B is likely, C is common. Drop rate is high.", "Honestly I took this course because it was easy, but I was also hoping to learn something too. Don't get me wrong you do learn basic concepts such as being honest and how humans take things for granted, but what im criticizing is the way he teaches it is frustrating. All he does is complain about people and Kean. Complains but gives no solutions.", "HE IS AWESOME", "Pretty much the greatest teacher I've had so far at Waterloo. He's hilarious and makes you wanted to attend class. Definitely take as many courses with him as you can, you won't regret it!", "LOVES TO HEAR HIMSELF TALK. Lectures are very long and boring. He goes over every lab and film you watch thoroughly before you do the lab or watch the film which completely takes all the fun and curiosity out of it. Very redundant. He will repeat things over and over again like you are a kindergartner and can't comprehend. Not my favorite class", "He made things clear in the class. But if you thought that taking this class would be easy because of childrens books you were wrong.

Nicest guy in the world!", "Taught at graduate level. Class is applied!

He uses example in real life and he makes it interesting.", "Professor Pratt is the best professor that I have ever had at Queen's law.

Participate in his class, he will never be a jerk and allow you to formulate your ideas. I love Harris!", "This prof knows what he is doing but doesn't know how to explain all the points to the class clearly. He has a different way of doing math than the book.

WORD OF ADVICE:Do the review, but it won't help you", "Great teacher! He enjoys helping students and has a great sense of humor. He teaches everyone as if they had just begun playing guitar.

There really is no interaction with the professor so it's all up to you. Online resources are helpful. If you need to take this class because it's a requirement take it because it's easy but If you want to learn and use it later take another teacher. He is not the most friendly so don't expect much.", "Ramin is amazing! Extremely interesting lectures. Really knows his stuff. Enthusiastic about the subject. Best CS class I have taken. You really learn a lot about CS rather than just programming.", "Professor Cohen is a great professor. Honestly, as long as you grasp the concepts of any programming language then translate them to the appropriate language that you're learning, you're good. There's a lot of homework, and the exams are all right, not too bad.", "We use DataDesk, a program he invented 30 years ago instead of something more modern. His ego is so big we can't use a real stat program since it was made by someone else. Makes it very difficult to get help cause no one knows how to use his program", "Very two-faced Professor.", "You will not learn anything from this teacher. He can not clearly explain a concept or stay on track with a thought. He can not engage the class and he will tell you to prepare for exams in one form and then change it without explaining. His test are not fair and will ask questions which are opinion based then mark it wrong.", "Dr. G is fantastic. He makes you feel validated and respected as a student. He never talks down to anyone. He keeps his lecturing as interesting as possible (it's still theory) and tries to engage students in the discussion. You can tell he puts his heart into his work and really wants to connect with the students. Take him!", "Took the self-defense class. Just gotta say: WOW! I never would have expected something this rigorous and thorough from OCC. Completely awesome course and teacher. The final: you use what you've learned to defend yourself against an 'attacker'! (or you can write a paper if you're scared like I was, lol) Definitely came out with knowledge!", "Jim was great and was usually always prepared for lectures. He oftentimes went over indie games and how well designed some of them are. This helped contribute to our game's design decisions. He met up with each team each week and gave critical, brutal advice. Not all of it was gold, but he definitely helped us (especially with art direction)", "hes hot! Take him if given the chance!", "WAY too man unfair ratings. He is kind, helpful, knowledgeable, and a great person.", "Explains material well, easy grader.", "This professor is ridiculous, his teaching method is insulting and annoying. That and he does not help anyone who doesnt understand the material, he mocks them.", "I loved Professor Arminio! Although he is tough, it's because he wants students to understand that college isn't supposed to be easy. But he is kind, funny, and when he lectures, he takes his time to make sure concepts are understood. He expects you to do a lot of studying on your own however. Would take again. So sad that he is retiring. :(", "Professor Fogel is a very nice and smart man, but he is extremely confusing as a lecturer. We constantly skipped around in every book we read, which made it very difficult to understand what was going on. He is available for help, but his explanations or answers to questions are often confusing. Grading is pretty fair.", "Really nice, prob the nicest prof. I've ever had and really informative. If he still shows the movie about the noodle, watch out because you'll have a ton of fun watching it and be quite surprised!. I def. reccommend him!", "Excellent.", "Mr. Salvo is the best. If you haven't taken him, do it! He's great!", "Barry is a very good teacher, he will adapt his lecture depending how fast the class is going and will give very helpful advice at recitation.", "Bio 475 is really not a difficult class. There are a few tests, but all the questions are given beforehand and discussed in class. The semester ends with a debate, which is pretty fun. My only advice and warning would be to FOCUS ON THE PAPER. You choose your topic after the first week, so just keep up with it.", "HE IS SO FUN. I LOVED HIM. GREAT TEACHER. HE TEACHES IN THE VN PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE ADN PROGRAM.", "Dr. Bosworth is a great professor and a friendly person. He is helpful and will make time for anyone if you have questions. He knows his stuff, which is always a plus. He is fair teacher who can sometimes get off-topic, but he keeps you on your toes and often has very interesting stories to tell. I would highly recommend him.", "WHOA HE TALKS A LOT!!!! Watch out people. Get lots of daydreams ready cause he will TALK YOUR FRIGGIN' EAR OFF!", "GREAT teacher! Knows his field extremely well. I actually looked forward to his classes. Lots of essays to write, but that's expected in an English course. Makes time fly with humorous stories and comments. Definitely recommended.", "I had Pro Pezzelo for Justice and Human Rights. He is amazing, great guy who cares about his students. Take home midterm and final which is really easy if you take notes and utilize his office hours. Come to class sign in and leave whenever you want, attendance is mandatory. He shows alot of movies. I'm taking him for two classes next semester!", "great prof", "Talham is a great guy, but thinks we are geniuses. He made the final very hard but because the average was pretty low, he changed the grade scale to help us out a bit, I had an 82 which was an A- in his class, so yes its hard but the scale makes up for it. I studied so hard for each exam but every exam was very difficult, and he covered more topics", "Jerry is an amazing teacher. He's super helpful and involves everybody in the class. He's super easy to talk to-- in office hours and out. He takes time to learn about each one of his students. His class is so much fun-- he's hilarious! He'll make you like math more than you did previously, guaranteed.", "DO NOT TAKE MESHAW. He does not teach anything and he mumbles so badly, you cannot understand anything he says. He simply uses class time to go over the cases in each chapter and the homework. His tests are very very difficult. Instead, take this class online at FSCJ!!!", "He was very friendly and nice. Sometimes he was hard to understand. I had trouble during his class and missed a lot of class, I got Cs on most my tests but since I got an A on the final and participated I got an A in the class! Hes very easy going!", "Delamater is incredibly knowledgeable and has a lot to say. This can work against him, however, because he will often go on and on about something that could have been said in 2 minutes. He is also disrespectful--making students feel embarrassed for saying the wrong thing, mocking students, rolling his eyes.", "He's not really a professor, just a glorified lab attendant. Either way, he thinks way more of himself than he should, and is terribly rude and condescending. Unfortunately, there's no way to avoid him if you take Photography. Just beware!", "simply the best", "Great prof, very nice!", "I really enjoyed this class.", "One of the easiest teachers ever, with a goal of giving everybody an A. Also one of the nicest guys ever!", "very very intelligent! Funny, helpful, and a cat lover!!", "Didn't realize how famous he was until I came here, LOL. On THAT note: YES! He's tough, fair but intimidating & will make you WORK for that grade. (Prof Sarna is gr8 as well!) You will NOT succeed if you're excessively absent/lazy. I HATED participating and he picked up on it so he would make me do it but it's all to make you better as a student!", "Unfair teacher. Expects you to know every exact detail that happened in history. Do not take if you are not a history person", "Prof. G keeps things straightforward, which works well for the class. He is very passionate about the subject, and his applications to daily life are interesting. If you read and study for the tests (they aren't difficult) it's no problem to get an A.", "Agree with previous comments: seems cold at first but then he warms up to you and starts joking about things. Always lets you out of class a few minutes late. At times he can be unclear about material but he's willing to help you understand it.", "very boring teacher, and really doesn't care about his students. If you go to class and get your perticipation points and do the online assisgnments your get a B or C in the class. The test are pretty hard and confussing though.", "I am a current student of his and I have to say that the man is convoluted, to say the least. He makes nothing clear, his grading system is a mess and he is not as responsive to students concerns with his class as you would hope. The text is informative, I will admit, but you won't \"feel right\" during or after his course...in MY opinion", "I loved Dr. LIppy!!! He really encouraged me to think outside the box, and we had a ton of class discussion, which made the course really interesting. He wanted us to learn on our own, then share what we learned and our opinion on it.", "He's a fantastic history prof who doesn't approaches his lecture with a bit of a sense of humour.", "Staggeringly intelligent, very funny and kind, Professor Fogel is wonderful, albeit very scatterbrained. His grading varies from fair to hard; don't expect an A on either of the papers he assigns. Sometimes it's hard to understand what questions you should be asking, and his answers don't always make things any clearer, but he is a great professor.", "Nicest man ive ever met in my life. all of his papers for Religion in Literature were about ourselves. It helped you figure out who you were as a person and it was a very helpful course to take during my freshman year of college. I have nothing but great things to say about him and his class.", "Good teacher. His classes were alot of fun, and the text was interesting and useful. I enjoyed his class, and he was always upbeat and excited. I'd like to take anohter class with him in the future. Highly reccomended", "great guy great class", "Where do I begin. First off, Professor Rooney is a VERY knowledgeable person. However, I believe that this was the hardest class I have ever taken. I expected to be able to get by from doing all the homework, reading, and attending every class session, but for some reason I could not succeed the way I wanted or expected to. Good Luck!", "He is excellent. Teaches on a college level. Not out to hold your hand but interested in seeing you be successful and is patient and helpful. His exams are tough. You have to read any text he uses. Would take his class again for his interesting methods in teaching. Very intelligent.", "Daily attendance. Grades aren't posted, so your grade is unknown till the end. Make sure you listen closely to lectures and take detailed notes. 2-3 quizzes a week. He spends class time talking about different essay topics instead of essay writing techniques/strategies, but if you work hard and follow his instructions closely, an A is attainable.", "you certainly learn a lot in his class - a little too much homework but it is all worth end of the term. his grading is fair and his lectures are great!", "Good guy. A lot of people don't like him but I think they are bl;aming the teacher for the subject matter. Dispite other comments I would recomend him. He's kindy nerdy (as are all science people) on occasion he's pretty funny in a physics professor kind of way. GO TO CLASS! Take good notes STUDY! keep up--you can do well but you gotta try.", "I've seen two sides of him. He is very passionate about Japanese culture and language as am I. However, as a language professor his course is very rigorous and demanding. requires a large time dedication regardless of your willingness to learn the language and this may interfere with other courses if you're taking this as an elective. I'm doing BSc", "Can't say enough good things about him ... great teacher, not easy to grasp - but very inspiring. Respectful of his students, open-minded, tolerant. In sum: best teacher I've ever had ! Take a class with him, if you want to expand your horizons. =)", "Worst class ever. Super easy, 3 non cumulative exams. Read the textbook the night before and you'll be fine. He's super boring and his lecture slides are just pages from the textbook that he wrote, and he just reads them out loud. But he takes attendance so you have to go to class and suffer through it. Doesn't know how to use uLearn either.", "Kowalka is a wonderful teacher and makes the class fun! I really enjoyed his class", "I was really looking forward to my first psych class and he completely turned me off. It was a horrible experience. He definitely played favorites. He constantly complained about the core and was probably just upset that psychology isn't part of it.", "I had Hammond for Micro in fall term 2016 and Macro in winter term 2017. I thought he was a good prof and was able to get good marks in both classes. However, after a year, it looks like that has all changed as I was reading all the comments for the fall 2017 micro term. Just goes to show how classes/profs can differ year to year. Just be careful", "Relies completely on exam grades, which can make the class really difficult. Get the textbook and look over anything he may have skimmed because it seems everything is fair game for his exams. He teaches on very specific topics for such a broad course that's supposed to cover all of plant evolution.", "What a guy. No suprises out of him at all. He'll help you out with anything. Just show up and you'll be fine. His quizes are nothing more than writing your name on a piece of paper. We had 2 tests the entire year, which were a mid-term and a final. If you can't pass this class, do something good for yourself and change your major.", "Great teacher! 4 papers, all take home", "I'll try to be objective and critical, something that this professor is not. The most BS class I've ever taken. His lectures are tangental, without evidence and leaves you thinking that only 85% of what he said is true. His exam questions are his interpretations of the readings, not the author's actual points. Any answer could be correct.", "sounds like someone who did not pass the course last Spring semester got on and tried to repeatedly slam him. He did not even teach the Fall, 2016!", "No Comments", "Intelligent, organized, has a contageous enthusiasm. Somehow makes difficult or boring concepts approachable & interesting. Will review concepts right before quizzes when students are confused. Straightforward testing, but a bit of a stickler on writing/proofs. Student-friendly grading points system.", "It's a fun course, but wow, the lectures are dull. It's too bad because he seems so into what he's saying, but the vast majority of his lectures are from the textbook. Still, he knows what he's talking about and posts the notes online (thank goodness: some slides hold multiple paragraphs!). It's worth taking his class, but bring along a coffee.", "Teacher is useless,he doesn't no English, doesn't no how 2 teach. Do not take his class unless you like to teach yourself. His lectures are boring. He tries to explain the concepts and formulas without examples. He is not clear at all. His tests are hard and the questions have nothing to do with the hw. Most of the time doesn't no what he is doing!", "\"The Todd\" is the man. I am sure that if I had had him as a math teacher earlier in life, I would be a rocket scientist by now.", "Great guy, really fun classes, in my 5th of his classes. Really great.", "Gary was obviously smart in his time. Unfortunately, he is a bit too \"senior\" now.", "The class feels like an honor's level class at times, due to his demanding nature. However, you earn every point you get, and you get every point you earn. Attendance is Mandatory. 4 tests, composed of two essays apiece. Gives possible topics for next test well in advance. Must be able to think for yourself and be prepared for class. Tough but fair", "Good teacher but he requires a lot of busy work and assignments are unclear at times.", "He is very picky about his papers and if you have one thing wrong in MLA style he will take alot of points off! Good luck I finished with a B but it was hard to get the B.", "I think he might be the only one that takes attendence. Most people study for other classes during his class... can pass if you go to study sessions... i'm sure there are better though.", "international marketing was horrible. the project sucks. it will consume your whole semester. he is the only teacher for international marketing so have fun. he is a tool in class but nice in his office", "Dr. Rayson was, by far the best professor I had in my time at Normandale. He is truly inspired me to do better in each assignment i handed in. His tests are essays in which you will know about weeks in advance. He allows revisions to these essays until you get the grade you want. I highly recomend this instructor to anyone.", "This class has nothing to do with the course description. It is a web design class and I don't know why it's not being displayed as one. Sanders is a really nice guy but he doesn't know how to teach. His tests are hard, he doesn't know what he's doing in class, and excepts you to know everything. Unless you're a MWD major, don't take this class.", "AVOID!!", "Camillo is easily the greatest communication teacher of all time period. He will be hard on you but it's for your own good. If you can't take Camillo, change your major because it gets no better than this.", "CIS 111 in general is a pretty boring. You basically learning the fundamentals of programming so don't look for this class to be extremely fun. Just study hard. Learn these fundamentals and look forward to taking CIS 111b. Trust me. Make sure you take Professor Kendall Martin for 111b. Her teaching style is inspiring and you work on cool stuff.", "good but demands you work to get a good grade", "Best Teacher at UK! Loved his Class!", "Dennis' outlook is all his own and he particularly works from a cynical, critical and contextual point of view. Not only is he extremely knowledgable and insightful, but he is also hilarious and entertaining. He is the best professor I have ever had and being his student was a pleasure and an honor.", "he's a great envi sci professor because he doesn't make you feel depressed about the subject. he wants to inspire you to help save the planet. you should take this class, it's one of a kind.", "Please, just whatever you do.. DO NOT under any cirumstances take this professor.. He is a very difficult teacher.. he wants you to\" THINK LIKE A PHYSICIST\" the problem is that WE students can't think like a PHYSICISTS. because DUH!!!!!!!!! we are not PHYSICISTS..", "Takes all the math out of statistics, which has its positives and negatives. Weekly homework and various different assignments required. Tests are tough and require a large amount of critical thinking. Class can be painfully boring at times.

Easy textbook to read.", "... oops, i meant \"She's an excellent teacher\" not \"She's an excellent course.\" lol", "No Comments", "Dr. Davis always has interesting information to share during class.", "Charismatic...Can make jokes at himself and others. One of the best guys I've ever met. He infuses a love of cinema in you!", "This class was fairly simple and engaging for those who wanted to get something out of it. The teacher is a fun guy who is sometimes a little too lenient with the less bright people in the class. But having us listen to Chris Walken perform The Raven was awesome.", "Homework, labs and other work not handed back very quickly. can be a a*# some days, and always thinks everything he does is the right way.", "I took Brooks for BSC1010 as well, same textbook that I never opened. Read the ppts! take notes on what he lectures! Go to classes and study for iclicker quizzes, they are pop quizzes & not scheduled. Exams often have a few freebies but they are very long, study well!", "He was so awesome and funny. He really opened my eyes to sociology and how incredibly interesting it is. He has an awesome sense of humor and is a very real guy. He class is really easy and he never takes attendance. Definitely take him for SOC!", "Take the online class if econ is one of your pre-req. His collaborate sessions are very helpful ,he is always available via email, has so far given so many quizzes ,more opportunities to redeem your grade.Good class,I learned a lot. Take it if your interested in learning and it will not be a major burden in your life.", "What should have been an interesting an informative class was simply awful. We rarely discussed the required reading and the concepts we were supposed to be learning weren't brought up, let alone explained. I came away from this class hating theory with a passion.", "Good luck trying to get anything clarified after the class is over.", "No Comments", "This class is hard!!!! And that is an understatement!!! I only missed 3 classes the entire semester and was still lost. You have to read the book and pay attention to every detail in lecture to understand what this man is talking about and even then,you will probably still be lost. I have never taken a class so hard and Ive taken many hard classes", "Does not teach! You have to learn everything by yourself, the tests are impossible, has no control over the class, people just leave and come the whole class, it's so annoying. Not very clear in explaining concepts, all he does is draw graphs and expects you to understand them.", "I was not interested in history, however Professor Stern was a really great teacher and kept your attention, I will definitely take one of his classes again.", "Overall, this class was petty. There's no textbook and slides are posted online before class. However, you will still need to go to lecture in order for you to know his anecdotes or opinions that he often puts on the exam. The material was not hard, however, it was not fun and can become time consuming. Cooke is a funny professor tho", "Good professor and a cool guy. Super helpful to go to office hours. His exams really test your understanding; you're expected to do everything he shows in class backwards and upside down regardless of whether or not he does it in class for you.", "loved him, but found that the class was more like a lit theory class as opposed to romantic lit. some readings are VERY dry, you really have to force yourself to get into them, although he does a very good job of making the readings clear and interesting. my lowest mark in university, i only just passed and worked very hard but still loved allard", "Picks favorites, biased, made creepy jokes around me when I was alone with him(I'm a girl), uses the same slides for lectures over & over.

BASICALLY TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN", "Make no mistake about it, if you've never had programming before this class will be very difficult. That being said, Jerry is a really nice guy and I ended up with a B- and should have gotten a C.

Try to avoid him if you can.", "OMG I took intro to physiological psych and I hated the class SO much. I had a really HARD time trying to pass, EVERY SINGLE DETAIL THAT HE SPEAKS ABOUT IN CLASS IS IN THE TEST. Things that you would think wouldn't be on the the test are on the test. He is funny in a weird way and he knows his stuff but he can't teach and the class is SO DIFFICULT", "I still get ****s thinking about how hot he is.", "Des knows his stuff and he expects you to work hard. He once told me he thinks of himself like a captain of a ship whose sole mission is to get from Point \"A\" to Point \"B\" (the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester) and if he loses some crew members along the way, so be it. Hilarious, chill guy if you get to know him a little.", "I am a junior from TSU, and he is beyond a doubt the worst prof I have ever had(or heard of).he thinks that he must teach at the MIT level, takes his responsibility way to seriously and truely just doesnt know how to explain the subject.

His classes are fun and very easy. He's really helpful and not boring at all. Art History with Terry is a great class to take, you'll learn alot of interesting things and it's FUN!!!", "You will LOVE this teacher! Very funny, and you can tell he really know his stuff. His lectures are very easy and fun to listen to. Many time he will hint out the mid term/ final answers during the lectures, so prepare! Your grade will be based of a mid term, essay, and a final. The tests are open notes/book, so don't sweat! Easy A, take him.", "A good guy and a fair grader. Overall a different but very solid professor.", "A good professor whose very personable.

The first day of class i was convinced he was mentally insane but by the end i was in love with him. Doesnt care about attendence. Very loose about due dates but care about important stuff like the quality of your work. He claims to be \" A hard 'A' but a fairly easy 'B'. It pretty much rings true.", "Hardy always came to class late, sometime even over 20 minutes. He was always poorly prepared and we rarely covered things on the test. I'm glad I am good at math and already knew the stuff he was trying to teach, because if not, I would have been screwed. I only needed the class for the credit.", "Had a great time in his class. Seems to take students ideas very seriously...sometimes more seriously than his own. But he wont let bad writing or ideas slide.

I am so glad he came back to teach this class. He really knows his stuff!", "I've had this professor twice now for two different classes and he tries to teach the exact same material.

Always returns your essays with constructive criticism so u know HOW to improve. DEfinitely recommend him!", "Hands down best math teacher I've ever had. If you ever have any questions, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. I went almost every week with homework questions and he was so so so helpful. His tests and homework are fair. He drops your lowest quiz as well. He is a very clear and organized lecturer, and is extremely approachable and helpful. Sweet sweet guy.", "Prof. Curtis is hilarious. He says \"yo\" a lot XD lol His class is really easy; it consists of papers to write and no tests! And the book that you must buy is really cheap. Overall, his class was hilarious. He is easy going and really cool. Don't be afraid to speak to him and show your personality! Easy grader, highly recommended !!!", "DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN AVOID IT. I'm a deans list student, great GPA and took him and it dropped my average significantly. If you just need a lab credit do anything else to avoid this- I'm so mad the reviews didnt warn me enough. People are right he is quirky and sometimes nice but overall his tests are impossible and he is not helpful at all.", "Charismatic guy, loved going to class and he made all of us laugh a lot.

His lectures are confusing and top of that he will give you his own notes (looks like he used a typewriter) and expects you to understand them. He is old school, and very forgetful. I don't know anyone who is having it easy in this class. Very stressful and you need to make EXTRA time for this class", "Incredibly awesome guy, very helpful, but his expectations for a non-science major are unfair. Not one person in class was a business major and he expected 6 hours per week at least for studying outside the classroom and that we study it everyday. I would not take this class again given the chance. Plus it had a lab... and lab project!", "funny", "Best prefesesor I have ever had", "Hes not a bad teacher, hes really boring with his powerpoint presentations but experiments make the class interesting. Basically no work all semester except for final.", "BAD professor. Killed my 4.0 GPA! Nice guy but does trick questions on exams. Avoid if you can", "He's a great guy but its hard to learn thermo from him. Goes off on too many tangents. Figured out after the 1st test that I could not go to class and still make the same grades. Im sure going to class would've helped a little more but you're just as fine studying old tests. You get a note sheet every test. 4 tests with lowest dropped and a final.", "He is an absolute amazing teacher, you MUST attend the class he is way better in class than online. he truly has a passion for this course. but KNOW YOUR STUFF! he has 4 tests with 2 essays, if you do not know the information or slept through lecture you will fail the tests, Read the textbook. I would recommend him any day! He is hilarious too.", "So goofy. So ancient. I wish he were my grandpa. I would know everything about the stars if he were. His class is awesome. He is awesome. Just hope you don't get the 'you're in college now' speech. I love his class and fully intend to take his other one next semester. He's the only teacher who demands a south facing classroom.

Def take this class with this professor", "Professor Damen has a different way of grading- you earn points by doing assignments and taking tests rather than losing them if you get a bad grade.

It is a fun, easy class, and Mr. Stewart is awesome!", "Overall a good professor. With all the bonus marks and \"gift\" marks, he makes it pretty hard to fail his class. He does extra review sessions before midterms and the final exam and it's really useful to attend them. He's a great lecturer but be prepared to do a great amount of work in his class or you won't get a good grade.", "Great guy. Great class. Fun lectures and he e-mails all notes which is super helpful for tests. May give a super easy quizzes (Q: Who are we playing this weekend? A: Georgia.) for a homework grade, but if you're not there, you'll get a zero, so go to class. (Making one really good review sheet is clutch for the final.)", "Prof Splane is the cutest professor ever. He really cares about you learning. He created all his assignments himself, and really wants students to get a good understanding so they have the most potential when they get out of college. Loved his class :-)", "Professor Hage is an AMAZING Instructor. He not only has great analogies for learning chemistry but also gives plenty of review and instruction for his students.

But his grading policy is all over the board. No consistency.", "mmmmmm", "he went against UNH handbook guidelines by giving out personal information of students to non students", "He's a wonderful prof; I'm so glad I had him teach me Japanese two years in a row.

The professor is the worst I have ever encountered in my life, and he has the nerve to call himself an educator. HE IS NO HELP AT ALL. I took it online, big mistake.. W.

He is a wonderful professor.", "Keep an Open mind.", "Class was fun but I didn't go. I didn't read or do anything.

Really really good guy because he cares about students and helps so much. Best professor ever.", "Knowledgable. Extremely helpful. Excellent class lectures. Labs can be difficult, but you learn a lot from them.", "I've had worse math teachers in the past. I really don't understand all of the bad ratings here.

His lecture and labs are the most difficult I've ever had but also the best. I graduated the RAD program 2 years ago and his classes helped a ton in the long run. My advice? Worry less about the textbook and a lot more about what he SAYS and writes on the board. If you can't listen/recall what he wrote on the board you'll fail.", "Shangraw is the man, he reminds me of my grandpa cause he tells lots of stories but they all have some sort of meaning. He's also a big hunter- cancelled class for us today (NOV 15-firearm deer season) cause ferris univ. is too gay not to. I'm stuck coming to my other classes this afternoon.", "His postive spirit helps students when the going gets tough. He is very kind and willing to help.", "Has been teaching English for 30 years. Loves lit; constantly talks about the \"beauty\" of a passage--or how \"this one line is worth studying the entire semester for--seriously.\" Compared to other lit courses, the reading is fairly light--about 2-4 chapters per class. But my first paper grade was a vague B+/A-, which you should expect a lot of.", "No Comments", "The guys a lunatic. He's never prepared for teaching his course.", "I think this professor is great. He knows a ton about the subject and isn't arrogant. He is helpful with writing problems and encourages students. I highly reccomend him.", "He makes this class interesting.", "Love Mark!

This can be annoying.", "No Comments", "Dr. Talham was a great lecturer, and very kind. Unfortunately, he hasn't taught for 10+ years, so none of his practice exams were up-to-date. He assigns lots of optional reading and h/w problems, but you don't have to do them if you use Study Edge.

Take His classes at any cost!", "Finally a professor who made me feel like I was in college! I loved Stoever and the class.

Highly recommende", "I did the same experiments in middle school. Wow! acid makes the rock sizzle--Ask him why and he doesn't know! It seems anyone these days can be a doctor. Tries to be a T. rex but is really a trilobite.", "He's a great teacher, and some people don't realize why he says and does the thing he does until they've moved on from DCC. Take what he says and use it. I've moved on from DCC and it took me to go away to another school to realize how much harder I should've worked. He sets his students up for the future. You won't get that anywhere else. I swear", "I never read the material and made up crap for the essays and still mangae to get a B.

You can tell he's a good professor but he gives way too much work for interns who are already slaving away, giving 20+ hours a week to a course where they are getting 4 credits.

Goes out of his way to help and definitely someone to use as a reference.", "Good professor", "He is a very nice teacher. He knows his material and he teaches well. I would recommend him to anyone. He makes jokes but they aren't always funny. He gives outlines for every unit. Tests are kind of tough; be prepared to study.", "Awesome guy but don't take him for UNIV 101 if you want an easy A. His tests were all essay or short answer. I had to spend a lot of time studying and didn't feel like I learned anything. If you're willing to put in the work you can easily make an A. He made the class interesting but I still felt like it was a waste of time.", "No Comments", "Professor Strong is an awesome teacher. He teaches the science and relates it all to real life. If you stick with him he eases up towards the end of the semester. He is knowledgeable and wise. He is always willing to stay after class to help and even held a study group on a Saturday morning before finals. He's the best! Take him if you can.", "Dr. Schreiber is a very intelligent, funny man, but he has no teaching skills. He spends the whole semester talking about completely irrelevant topics. You will be required to learn the material on your own. His exams are extremely difficult, but it doesn't really matter since he curves them anyway. Total waste of time and money.", "This prof seems great at first, but ends up being terrible. He has one funny joke a class, but the rest is just rambling for attention.Because he takes so much time telling stories, when the test comes around you are clueless. Stay away from this professor", "No Comments", "I took Dr. Shreiber for l & c, he is a pretty good professor, but he does kind of \"ramble\". I thought I would dread the lab, but it was actually kind of fun. The tests aren't that bad, and the quizzes in lab are a \"joke\"! You do have to read the book, and he does expect you to talk about the chapters in class! He was fun and kept it interesting!", "Amazing class. Entertaining and knowledgeable, plus he's more than willing to accommodate changes in schedule. Show up and you'll have to try to fail", "It was a very rough class. One thing to know about this guy is that he grades harshly. Exams were difficult (e.g. he expects you to memorize word for word definitions from the chapter and reproduce it on the exam). He also had reading assignments for in-class discussions regarding bioethics which were pointless and time consuming.", "you either loved him or hated him for the most part. i loved him as a prof", "I took this class online over the winter session. After reading his reviews, I figured the course would be a walk in the park however I was extremely misinformed. The tests are extremely difficulttricky and the work load is intense. Do not expect this class to be a breeze! Passed but not sure I would take again, it was pretty frustrating.", "No Comments", "Kerstein is a nice old man with impeccable hebrew pronunciation. He's old-fashioned but (usually) in a charming way and will not teach you 'current' hebrew.

The problem we've noticed in the midterm is that even though our arguments are fully supported, which fulfills the requirement of a good essay/short answer, as long as he doesn't agree with your opinion, he will dispute the answer and give it a bad grade.", "This class is horrible (i am in i right now). He does not \"teach\" he expects you to read these complicated ethic books and teach yourself and make your own study guides. So if you don?t understand it you will fail the tests like half this class. 4 HARD tests/quizzes. He is useless as a teacher and isn?t clear with what you should study.", "This class is the hardest one of the most boring classes you will take.

I've been through colleges & universities in norcal and socal & he's the best soc teacher. For the person who says he's cocky,he's not really. But he has every right to feel smug. He's been through the peacecorp & he's trying to open a nonprofit. What the hell have you done for this world?", "He knows a lot about what he teaches, however, telling others of what he knows isnt a strong point of his. each class there is (at least) one quiz. they are worth 100 points each and 10 questions. although there are so many, if you get 4 questions wrong your already at 60%. He drops the 2 lowest grades, but in the long run, it doesnt help.", "He's passionate about teaching, willing to help, and he cares about students and Denison as a community.

Knows his stuff", "He is one of the most intelligent and well-informed (and not just about his subject matter) people I have ever learned from.

New students: heed warning and check all syllabi posted on the WHP section of the Oakland website. The answers are there - just read.", "Great", "He was a good prof--Communications is a **** major--so stop your whining", "Osland is a very nice man. His intro marketing class, however, is tough. The lectures are fun, but his grades are not posted on Moodle. Also, he grades very subjectively by always requiring essays on exams vs. multiple choice. Study very hard for this class.", "He seems to be confused in his own lectures. He gives you information then has test on something completely different.", "No Comments", "He definelty inspired me", "Nice Guy. Easy class if you have some background in Bio, like from highschool. Lectures are alright.", "I finally learned how to write a research paper. Class is great and you learn so much stuff. Hes a great teacher and a great guy.", "I have never hated a class so much. The professor is totally useless. I agree with everyone else and their negitive comments. Forget about asking for help. If you have a choice don't take this class with him!", "He's into it and I learned a lot.", "A BORING teacher, believe me, with absolutely no gift to teach anything. He is one of the worst teacher ever and can even makes the most interesting subject into a thing you wouldn't hear about anymore. By the way, he is a specialist at giving you critical information at the last moment (like the place of an exam 2 hours before it)", "No Comments", "Just memorize the Powerpoint slides n briefly go over the book pages he assigns before the exams n this class is a sleepwalk.U can use his class time as a study session.U can use PC and he wont care.The project is not hard just annoying n make sure u hook up w/ smart people 2 do well on the sim game", "Dazzling intellect and a concern for students not often seen at Cal.", "First, ignore the Steve Jobs comparisons. Black turtlenecks with black jeans are the only things the two have in common. I have had him twice now, and really enjoyed his business class. He can be a bit self-absorbed, and loves to namedrop. Nevertheless, great professor who cares about his students and the university. Highly recommended.", "Kraay was great lectures were amazing and he used so many examples if you didn't understand the concepts. If you didn't go to lecture then you won't do well. I didn't use the textbook much but it would have helped. Good class.", "i knew him when he was still in GEOGRAPHY. back then his labs were the booster for my GPA. rock on.", "Seems to get flustered on opening basic programs such as powerpoint", "It was my favorite subject - I never skipped a single class, read notes and textbook, did my assignments and always visited his office. The only patterned grade I got throughout the semester was C+. If I didn't do all of the above I wonder if I would end up with anything higher. Sometimes it's hard to understand what exactly he wants from you.", "No Comments", "This guy is amazing. He has a thick accent yes, but if you come to class and show that you truly care you are fine. I absolutely love him. I hate that we have to use Avid as the main editing software but he will help you. All you need to do is go to him. He is so inspirational. Cant wait to take his AP class.", "I feel bad for how much my friends and I fooled around during class. He was a little boring at time, but I think it was more the subject. He knows what he teaches very well.", "He's talented at not only explaining what he means clearly, but also at understanding what student are actually saying. I had him for my senior essay advisor, and he was extremely helpful. He focuses on getting as much as possible out of any conversation without making you feel inadequate while still encouraging you to learn and challenging you.", "He makes some difficult concepts accessible, and you can definitely learn a lot from his lectures, which are engaging. However, he tends to take a very particular view of a lot of contractual issues and principles, and is quite hard on students if they don't get \"exactly\" the answer he is looking for--this makes exams more difficult to do well on.", "Best class yet in the department of education. Truly useful material! Thanks D!", "Rudi is a great teacher! He knows what he is talking about and he is pretty amusing to listen to. I have taken 2 classes from him and have done very well. I recommend him to anyone wanting to take a geography class.", "Dr. Spivey is a very good teacher, not always the easiest teacher, but knows what he is talking about; and truly interested in helping students excel.", "Quite possibly the worst class I've ever taken. His tests do not cover the material presented in lecture, he doesn't like athletes, and is unconcerned with 18 out of 21 people failing.", "Very nice guy and very knowledgeable, different type of person that's all, he's the head of math depart so you figure. The contents are very interesting if you like science. Take notes or even better just listen to the class and understand. Very open for questions, always willing to answer. Makes you think. Fair amount of hw. Really enjoyed! =)!", "Good teacher. Very nice guy. Gives somewhat difficult exams but is helpful outside of class. I would recommend taking his course. Solid accounting professor.", "Dr. Bodek is very knowledgeable and his lectures are filled with anecdotes and details, they're very pleasant. Just keep in mind that you must take notes at all times because there is no textbook for the Weimar Germany class, other than two compilations of readings.", "Milner is terrible. He brags about being organized but never knows what chapter we're on or what we have due. He changes the class schedule all the time, is super condescending, doesn't teach towards tests or go over them, and assigns really stupid assignments for seemingly no reason. Don't take him if you have the choice.", "Dr. Thielen (tee-lynn) is easy to understand and very organized. I was in his hybrid class and his presentations were easy to follow and understand. The book is used heavily as you have to write a discussion paper every two to three weeks. The tests, taken on scantrons, aren't too difficult, but fair and occasionally have funny suggested answers.", "I like his lectures and labs. Its the exams which I find completely absurd. What is emphasized in class is not what is tested on, rather there is a very heavy focus on material specifically NOT emphasized. Unless you are capable of memorizing every little thing he says, you are stuck with a passing but mediocre grade on the exams.", "Professor Martin covers the material very well and clearly has a passion for it. After the first few classes it becomes obvious that he is a computer veteran with enormous amounts of experience. He provides a great overall learning experience and many examples from his career for the practical reasons behind material covered. Great Professor.", "I loved the class. He keeps it interesting and tells hilarious stories. He never uses the textbook in class or gives out assignments. If you listen and read the chapters, plus go over powerpoints, you should be fine.", "Mr. Shorr has interesting lectures, he knows his stuff. Don't worry too much about memorizing his lectures, study the guides he gives you and you will ace the tests. He is intimidating and likes to be the boss. Raise your hand and he wont yell at you.", "First time with this professor and I thought he was easy. Technically you can miss class 10 times. (10pts for attendance.) Participation isn't much, just a midterm and final, watch a lot of movies in class. Complains about Kean a lot. Easy A...", "Ian is a weird guy and not a great instructor but it's easy enough to do well if you readmemorize the textbook and show up to class. He loves to hear himself speak so it's hard to have meaningful conversations. His marking is inconsistent and ambiguous at times. He doesn't really lecture so you have to read and memorize the book to do well.", "I took four separate classes with Fred, and he was without a doubt the single best teacher I've ever had at any level. He knows everything about everything, always has a book recommendation, can hold court for hours. Take whatever you can with him - particularly his more history-oriented classes.", "BG I owned you!!! If you do not like this class you are not an academic, drop out now! I have never laughed so much in a class in my life, he's so funny. Oh yeah, no matter what BG says the Temple was destroyed in 70 CE... NO other historian will give a different date.", "Such a wonderful professor. He really know how to teach you and how to calm you down. He has a very special way of helping you understand the world and yourself through writing. You would be missing out if you don't take his class.", "Great teacher easy grader!!!! I should not have passed this class with a C!", "Great prof, tests are extremely fair, fun to listen to, and I only have one thing negative to say - lose the green cord pants!!!", "Pretty solid prof", "Dr. Pecorino is one of the most confusing professors I have ever taken. I have never had to put in more hours studying for a class then his. He will change every practice problem from the study guide on the test and confuse you to no end. Would definitely recommend taking any other Econ class.", "liff is the man! def take him if you can. sure the tests are hard, but he does try to give you partial credit and he gives out lots of extra credit. stay with it, he is always tyring to help out if you are behind.", "Cares for his graduate level classes but sure as hell couldnt care less about his undergrads. Its sad.", "No Comments", "really easy, should take", "No Comments", "If you have Phelps, be prepared to teach yourself physics. As everyone else has said he gives no partial credit so don't be surprised to get a lot of zeros on quizzes or test questions. Only benefit of taking him is that you get take home exams, which is good only if you know what you're doing.", "Belittles his students. Class not worth taking.", "What a ****", "Great Prof!.. too bad he's not at York permanently, every student should have a chance to take a course with him!", "Very intelligent in the subject but requires too much irrelevant work. No tests is an upside but all the papers make up for it.", "His reviews are always the test!", "at first it was interesting. in the beginning of classes we have to mediate. we are not allowed to have necklaces of course you cant have jeans. he assigns you with a partner to study the karate moves; sometimes its annoying.", "Professor Afshari is very smart! Will study you while you speek and BE CAREFUl, DO NOT TALK IN HIS CLASS!Will hear any little sound. Overall I would take him in future courses.", "He wasn't clear about what he wanted. If you want an A, make sure that the shapes you draw are neat and there are no messes outside and inside of the border. No matter how ugly your painting is, he accepts it as long as it's neat and it is based on the guidelines. He also lets you to redo any assignment and turn it in.", "Great guy... Lets you turn in papers whenever it is convenient for you-- really cares about his students.", "The reason I came to this school. He actually TEACHES physics. Most teachers of science/math don't do it properly and are so useless that you could learn as much studying on you own in the same time. Best teacher I have ever seen for any technical subject and I have had 6 physics and umpteen math teacher in my life. He should be cloned.", "He is hard, study if you take his class.", "Interesting lectures, but not nessisarily exciting. Read your text, or you're doomed on the exams.", "Extremely helpful professor. He is very committed to his students and he is always there to offer his help. He is the best professor ever, I would take again and I highly recommend him.", "If you are a mechanical student- he is hard. If you are a different engineering taking it as a tech elective- don't. Very confusing, and does not explain things thoroughly at all. Book and he assumes extensive prior knowledge in mechanical engineering. He seemed liek he knew his stuff very well-but doesn't explain anything well enough", "The teacher is a little rude and sarcastic at first but he eases up on it in the long run.Easy class. Self taught course and collaborating with peers help. You need to network with peers. Take home final. Take home midterm. Instructor is absent a lot, but it's ok. At the end of the class you will have answers if you ask the questions. He loves qts", "Had a blast in his course! The course was well structured. He was passionate about teaching, and cared a lot about the students. Unfortunatly, this was his last year at UW!!!", "Very personable and easy to approach. Teaches mostly through PowerPoint slides. Gives no HW only reading assignments. Tests are PowerPoint slides, 50 slides, 50 minutes and no going back. Final was multiple choice and three essays to choose from out of six. Utilize his office hours, study the material and the course is not that difficult. Grade: B-", "I like the guy. He's very helpful, wants his students to succeed. He tells you what he wants & if you follow him you should get an A. He posts his slides online. Some of my classmates got by without reading the chapters. I read/skim about the countries to help with the midterms, finals, and papers. He takes attendance but not everyday.", "Extends due dates, as long as you talk to him. He is super chill. AWESOME PROFESSOR! Would totally recommend!", "Decent lecturer, but came off as very lazy (i.e. showing Frontline documentaries almost every class and giving the entire class a same grade on papers). Didn't reference the textbook once but gave a final based on stuff in it that he didn't come close to discussing in class... Frustrating! Don't dislike him personally, but not a good teach at all", "He's very understanding and an overall great person. He cares for the students; thus he doesn't punish you for not attending class or turning in assignments late. Articles on D2L used to take notes and write a short essay. Time consuming but very easy. He does service learning so I got enough e.c to skip writing a final paper. OH YEAH, NO EXAMS", "No Comments", "He is an awesome professor who is willing to help his students. He is very passionate in teaching and understandable.", "thinks too much, knows too much, but all in all hes a great person to work with. Though sometimes it looks like its painful for him to teach..all the sweat is a shame..", "Best Professor ever, learned everything from mapping and rock formations to life lessons from the best professor/advisor I have ever had.", "He is really anal about reading aloud in class, but his intentions are all good and the workload is pretty easy. I thought when he handed out signed copies of his book it was a nice gesture, though he does have kind of a bad taste in literature.", "if you read you will pass then tests are a piece of cake and if you need help he's is always open to your questions he has ALOT of patience ! great professor!", "Race and Ethnicity is a class with a lot of potential, but Professor Pyle just didn't live up to that!", "Terrible teacher. Unorganized, boring, and hung up on his own ego. He made an interesting subject completely unbearable. As a history major, I learned nothing.", "Enjoyed this class, got clear understanding of the context of Shakespeare's plays to history and culture of the time, and how it is used to relate to present day. Recommend the class, film adaptation fun to watch and compare. He is a fair teacher and clear on what is expected from his class.", "not a very good teacher, comes off as kind of a jerk", "Took him in the summer and he was ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. His grades are based on: attendance, oral presentation, 1 midterm w/ essay, and 1 final w/essay. Essay prompts are given 1 week in advance to prepare for. GO TO CLASS!! His exams are based on lectures. The book is helpful, not necessary. Loved his laugh and his personality. 3", "boring class. never knew what he was talking about most of the time. the book is not a must. he is good at teaching, he would be better if he gave some sort of outline for what he was teaching.", "one of the best denison has to offer. and cute!", "Craig is amazing. At first you'll find him quirky and different but he grows on you. I made the mistake of missing lecture a lot and that really affected my grade because EACH lecture he grades and gives points for participation. He does offer A LOT of extra credit and his discussions are outdoor and super hands on. We did a lot, good experience", "Jerolmack is the best professor I have had during my four year college career. He is extremely intelligent, always helpful, and provides thorough explanations of abstract ideas. It was a pleasure and a great experience being in the presence of such an innovative teacher. By the way...he is HOT!!", "Dr. Talham is the best professor I have had at UF. Had him for Chem 2. If you expect an easy A then don't take him. He will make you work for your grade, but be fair in doing so. Acknowledging that his class was hard, he changed the grading scale to about an 84 being an A. The downside is that he travels, but that is expected for a tenured prof.", "If you dont pass with an A in this class then you did something wrong. Only thing you do all year is lectures and there are 3 test. If you get an A on the first two then you dont have to take the final test. HE GIVES YOU THE TEST AS A STUDY GUIDE, literally hands you the exact test just look over notes and power points.", "I past, but I cant tell you any thing about the class. I can tell you that Williams owns some property and some other personal things about him. Well, I quess the class was about him!!", "Good prof. Read the text and do practice questions and you will be fine.", "Concepts don't apply to real world; boring and full of himself", "No Comments", "Best proff i've had at the UofC, is extremely helpfull and has an excellent attitude", "He is absolutely borring!!! I had him for forensic psych and he is borring and hard. Plus he is a weird professor. I DO NOT recommend him!", "No Comments", "horrible teacher. He uses his personal opinion over the text information on tests. Don't buy the book you won't need it. attendance isnt mandatory so don't bother going. He's rude and has a very negative outlook on life. The very first day of class he let us know that 50% of us would be divorced! He's just ruuude!", "makes learning extremly fun. sometimes give to many essays, buy you'll forgive him. It's hard to get a word in sometimes. Time really flies in this class. For once learning was enjoyable.", "I had this guy last year and let me tell you that after every class I would go to my car and start crying. He made me feel stupid, and pretty much I was board but still tried very hard!!! I was SO FRUSTRATED!!! Again I left almost every class in tears!", "No Comments", "Solid professor, Attendance & Lateness is key. Get there on time and pay attention, you'll be fine. Not the best but not the worst either.", "He will kick your butt and you will thank him for it. Our class went from 30 students to less than 10 by midterms. Read his powerpoints as he leaves clues as to what he will test on. Listen to his advice and study at least 24 hours a week. Make your own study guides. You have to put in the effort but he will work with you to help you succeed.", "He is not only a wonderful professor, but a great man! His class is super fair - and almost easy if you take good notes and attend class. He is very friendly and loves to engage with the class. He will do whatever he can to help, would definitely recommend him. Take good notes - you'll get an A easily.", "This is one of the worst classes I have ever taken. His tests are ridiculously difficult. My grad student for my lab was foreign and was incomprehensible and couldn't understand half of the questions we asked. He asserted that over half the class failed the first exam bc we didn't study enough... RUN AWAY!!!!", "Be ready to work, but not impossible. Class is mandatory if you want to do good! He skips around and picks and chooses stuff in the later chapters, and if your not there, you will be studying the entire book. I got an A on the first test, B on the second. If you get an A on the final, thats what you get for the class; even if you got 30's", "Amazing prof! Cares about the students and really wants you to do well! His lecture notes are really confusing but I think he is hoping people will make use of your textbook! He really knows what he is talking about, he is a very smart man. I relied on my textbook a lot, to the extent that going to class probably wasn't necessary.", "I do not recommend this professor at all.His exams is unfair and does no show interest in students, however the lab section is great. Brianna Young the lab assistant is great.", "Prof Giarratani's lectures were directly out of the book. They were a good review of the readings, but they tended to get very boring and monotonous. He had interesting stories but the majority of the lectures were him reviewing book material. His tests are worded in an extremely tricky manner as well.", "Very unorganized, but very fair. He is very helpful one on one, but in a group, he tends to be unclear.", "Bill is easily one of my favorite teachers. He makes the class fun and his teaching methods work great. I would definitely recommend taking his class!!!!!", "his class was majorly easy! He gives notes for each chapter section, and test reviews. However, his lab makes you sweat a bit... but when it's fun, it's great.", "Really great guy. He is very passionate about philosophy and is very attentive to the students needs. A lot of class discussion, and be sure to speak up a lot so he can get to know you. It will help you out when you need to talk to him or if you need letters of recommendation. A LOT of reading, not always interesting, but topics were fascinating.", "Best teacher at AICAOC in my opinion. He is very big on concept and will help you become a better designer. You should take at least one of his classes before you graduate.", "Great teacher! Professor Andy Jones made the six-week quarter fly by. I liked his PowerPoint quizzes, and his crazy allusions. The class is a lot of work, but he grades fair. I really appreciated Andy's wide-eyed humor - he connects almost everything we read to other assigned works, or to pop culture. I would take another class with him in a minute", "worst teacher at sjsu...no wonder MIS sjsu grads get crappy jobs..because the interim dean for MIS is the worst teacher in MIS!!!!", "Pretty good, interesting class. I have pretty ambivalent feelings towards his lecturing style - seemed a little too scripted at times, which I didn't like, but the lectures were very organized", "Very helpful outside of class, especially to the person who is intimidated by Shakespeare. Interesting perspectives on film productions, and clear in his expectations. Tests are extremely reasonable.", "Ballard is the man, he only gives you one homework assignment for the entire semester. Though the tests are 70 questions long, they're often over many chapters at a time, meaning if you just read the chapters you'll have no problem. Plus he's funny.", "Very quiet, very unclear, very nerdy. He means well, this is his first year. I cant say he is doing a bad job. If you need clarity, ask him and he will explain it.", "Prof. Amrine is the best professor I've ever had... extremely intelligent person, great to talk to, go to office hours! Take all of his classes. Your perspective on lifethe universeexistencephilosophywhatever it is will broaden... this is what college is all about.", "Doctor Wolf really is an amazing professor. Doesn't force his opinions upon you, makes you write a journal (but very easy) uses powerpoint for the material, never uses the book, he likes participation. He's very funny, i enjoy going to his class. Has no shame at all. He's pretty descriptive haha. But a VERY good class. I recommend taking it.", "Basically a midterm & a final. \"In every 2 classes, a sheet with 10 questions based on the chapters of the textbook is given. After completing the sheets, they are used as study guides\". He knows his stuff but you can easily fall asleep in his class.", "this prof. really needs to retire.he is just an miserable old man, who thinks he is better than you and doesnt need to help you bc you should already know.he is very short with you and mean. also is very unclear about every element of the project and then messus up your grades on reports/tests.", "probably the easiest five credit class you can take at Point, doesnt grade the labs you grade is determined by quiz and exam scores, really nice guy willing to help whenever you need it", "He is the hottest professor in the school!", "He is so unclear about what he wants. He actually told us what he wanted for a project presentation, then counted us off when we presented saying he didn't tell us any of those things. He has no idea who you are even if you want to think he does. He could care less about you. He is the only teacher so it made me want to change my major.", "Chemistry with any professor is HARD, the subject is HARD in general. Dr berg has years!! of experience and he really makes his lectures in a way where its understandable and applicable to exams. His exams are difficult but not tricky. Pay attention and take notes, make sure you don't make common student errors that he points out. AND PRACTICE Q's!", "What in the name of God was he talking about? I sat in his class for an entire semester and had no idea what he was talking about each and every day.", "Kinda cute but boring as all hell. Slept in his class regularly. Hard class and hard grader. I'd avoid.", "Very nice and understanding professor. His dry humor is amusing although sometimes I find myself drifting during his class.", "He is a great professor. He really wants everyone to do well. He keeps you informed about what he expects of you and is really laid back. Is truly a good professor and a good guy.", "Most of are class failed all the tests", "Awful professor. Late more than not, doesn't actually teach, just tells stories about how great he is. Worst class I have taken at St. Olaf.", "Hard!!", "Subjective and opinionated. Not a good teacher. If every student in the whole program gets a terrible score on a lab assignment, do you think it may have something to do with the clarity of the instructions? NEVER admits when he is wrong, and he enjoys messing with your future by lowering your GPA. Hopefully you have a different teacher for 362.", "I expected this class to suck, and for me to suck at it. But I was proved wrong on both.", "I HATED this class. Please run for the hills!!", "If you are majoring in Bio, by all means take him. But if not, stay clear. Like one said before, he teaches at one level and expects you to know it at a much higher leve.", "very nice teacher", "I've had Ian so many times I've lost count. Genuinely wonderful both as an educator and as a person. Each time I've had him, I've been asked to examine literature in new and impactful ways. Respectful and interested in the opinions of his students. You can't get away with not reading the books, though, so don't try it. He'll know. Highly recommend.", "Hands down my favorite instructor at Green River. Went into the class not expecting much but turned out amazing. He is extremely helpful and will go out of his way to help students. Lectures are informative and interesting. Very understanding of your mistakes and works with you to fix them. A+ teacher all around.", "No oppinion, nothing speicial.", "If you want to be constantly indoctrinated with socialst ideas, take this course. Hirschl legitimately spends most of his time in lecture pushing an agenda. It's infuriating when the garbage he's spewing is coming out of the mouth of a bumbling idiot. That said, this class is an absolute joke and if you have a functioning brain it's an easy A.", "Beneski is an intellegent man , he knows what he is talking about but is an awful professor. He has no idea on how to relay the message. Anatomy is a comprehensive class in which you have to take a 50 question test in 50 minutes, its absoutley obsurd. I got roofied one weekend and he wouldn't let me re-take a quiz, I had my hospital records also.", "Show up for class and read the chapters. Class is really general and the final is a take home essay! easy A", "If you are looking for an easy A. This is the guy wo give it to you, but if you are looking for an actual education take a professor that has a degree in english. Fred Simmonds is a waste of money!!", "I've had a class with Dr Janz before, and I took him again this semester. He's a great professor. I'm not interested in religion at all, and he explained everything so clearly and straight-forward that it was easy to remember and understand. Tests are MC + essay. Plus, he uses the canadian grading scale (80-11=A), for an added bonus!", "This guy could care less if u write a thing all u have to do is show up and say a few things and if u don't liek your gread jsut ask hell change it def take him its cake", "Very nice. Sometimes maybe too nice. Not assertive at all, which can be frustrating.", "I thought he was a good teacher. Not the most friendly though. Although he is willing to give you many opportunities with late work, despite how intimidating he is in the beginning. His exams are all essays and the grading is NOT easy on them. Make sure you do the quizzes, journals, and discussions to make up for the midterm grades. Make an effort.", "tough gradrer", "After 2 semester w/ Paulo I've decided to major in WL. I have never met such a dedicated prof who is so passionate about what he teaches that students automatically become engaged in discussions. I don't understand the nasty comments about him cause in the 2semesters that I've had him none of the students in my classes ever felt that way about him.", "Simon is a very difficult and demanding teacher. If you take him don't plan on getting much sleep or having much time to do anything else besides design work (not even your other school work). He is extremely abstract and does not accept traditional style designs.", "OK first I just have to say my dad is a high school math teacher so in addition for going to extra help in the math center I still could not get modivated for this class. He is very monotone. He was very boring,I would go home and have my dad teach me. Gillies talks about to much science, I mean its a basic algera class, not med school.Horroable", "Great teacher. Doesnt rely on book that much and teaches from expierence. Has great stories, lets us out early and gives a easy take home midterm. Great class to take. Highly Recommended.", "I am in Dr. A's Collegiate Chorale. It really does prepare its' singers for sophomore year and beyond; hopefully for St. Olaf Choir! I love Dr. A's warmups and his choice of repertoire for fall semester. What a wonderful director!", "Pretty cool. Keeps things to the point mostly. Wanders around a bit but that's ok. Funny. Doesn't take himself too serious.", "Confusing. This is the one word that I can use to describe this professor. Ruckh talks too much about things that don't make sense. Most of what he says is irrelevant, and I find it hard to come to class everyday. He doesn't seem to appreciate your opinions if you don't agree with him. Ruckh is smart, but teaches in a confusing way...", "an easy a!", "He was not that difficult of a professor. His tests were straight forward and offered extra credit.", "He refused to put any grades in the grade book. I had no other errors in my papers, except him writing \"confusing\" next to seemingly random sentences in my paper, somehow warranting me with a C grade on most papers. English has always been my strongest subject, and I usually ace papers. Not with this guy. Miss a peer editing day? 0 on that paper.", "Had Jason for Sound Art. Jason is very helpful and enthusiastic. Good teacher. But the class utterly favors electronics and Jason seems to believe that if its not Avant Garde its weaker. Its a bit like going to a music school and taking an art class to find that the prof is a virtuouso in photoshop who thinks painting is passe.", "The good: the weekly readings. Topics varied among articles, chapters out of books (good stories), and interpreting rap cyphers. Keeping the topics engaging is important because like I said, they're weekly. 3 papers, sometimes he'd say he told us something that I didn't recall him saying. \"I told you guys a million times do this and that\" When? Lol", "Arminio is a competent, if not charismatic, professor. He's old school, bone-dry, and clear-cut in his teaching style; nothing flashy, there to teach not to entertain type of educator. He does care for his students, but his sense of humor is as dry as his teaching style. You will learn, but just try to take some of his comments with a grain of salt", "Professor Patierno is an excellent teacher. He's incredibly kind and he teaches straightforward but interesting lectures. My advice to you is to make a friend in the class that takes good notes that you can photocopy, this way you can relax and soak up all the fascinating anthropological goodness....and yes, everything is multiple choice.", "whoever is saying he doesnt offer extra credit is a bold faced lie its even on the syllabus...you prbly never showed up to earn any EC...or even read it...ill admit i struggled but he always said come to office and he showed exactly where the answer was on our outlines he printed out..ive been outta high school 16yrs and got a B!", "I love you! You are the best teacher I have ever had! Thank you for all your effort and enthusiasm!!!!", "Very inspirational professor...Made the class interesting and fun...FIU should definitely keep him...I never met ANYONE who truly loves and enjoys educating people. The class is easy but you must put in work. The teaches are fun and you learn a lot from them.. I will miss Prof. O and his class sooo much! BEST PROF. EVER!!", "The tests and papers are largely based solely on reading and outside work. I could do as well on them not having ever gone to class, and I got a B+ in the class. Hes mean, unhelpful, plays favorites, and spends too much time talking about france.", "This class was really difficult. I found a lot of his lectures hard to comprehend because he doesn't really go in depth with step by step, concise directions. He's a nice guy but I think this class is better suited for someone that already knows a bit about statistics or is generally very good at math.", "I had him for Crisis Intervention and Abnormal Psych. He is the nicest teacher I have ever had! I never heard him raise his voice once and he is also very interesting. He makes class fun to go to. You watch a lot of videos too.", "His papers are so hard to write. He is very unclear with what his guidelines are for the paper. He seriouly needs to know that we aren't taking this class because we want to. But other then that he is a very nice guy.", "No Comments", "My only complaint with Dr. Scripps' web applications course was that his material was somewhat dated. Direct questions about HTML5 or new JavaScript standards fell by the wayside. That being said, Scripps has an interest in data science, so his thoughts and answers on the internet and web technologies as a whole are very insightful.", "he is really hard to understand at times, mumbles, but overall, great humor and very interested in material. made the information quite interesting! i would take him if u need PHL....", "Youre going to read a lot. He is not easy. He also doesnt tolerate slackers. In other words, he's the real deal for a professor. I didn't pay for a dumbed down education. Blitz takes students seriously and demands a lot. And that's what you should want. It's only been 4 weeks, and this is already my favorite class. Then again, I'm here to learn.", "Professor Epler is a really helpful person. He makes sure you know what you are doing, which is great. I'm not the best with math, but he helps make it bearable.", "Great teacher really cool loved his class but really not for the sensitive. He's a touch grader but I really enjoyed the class he makes it interesting", "SUPER LAID BACK. pretty simple class; read - take quiz - some papers - a group presentation at the end - the the final paper. Very nice man. I would definately recomend him and this class. Easy GE!", "His teaching style is the best I've seen in a while. He is engaging, and forces his students to think for themselves and actually learn the material.", "No Comments", "Teaching via the Socratic Method is BS in a Greek Literature class! I don't like teaching myself.", "good ole BR^2. My favorite instructor by far.", "Professor Potter is the best instructor I've had! He makes every class fun and really knows what he's talking about. Make sure you read the book to pass the midtermfinal (even though he gives you a study guide). Highly recommend this class! Enjoy!", "Dr. Gruenert is a deep thinker and really wants to hear all students thoughts and opinions during class. Although he may appear to be intimidating at first, he really just wants class participation. I learned so much in this discussion-based class and would encourage anyone to take his classes.", "He either lectures the whole time or plays a video. All powerpoints you need are on BeachBoard, which are so helpful for the exams! Not everyone attends class, but he truly hopes his students do well in his classes, so he DOES care about his students. Not a super easy class, but it is possible to get an A. I didn't need the books.", "This professor needs to retire now! I took his PSYCH 330 class and it was horrible! Boring lectures, confusing material, and not helpful! The tests are really hard! He gives you the Q&A ahead of time but expects you to memorize 250 multiple choice questions and only chooses 50 of them for the actual test! DONT TAKE !", "Prof. Curtis was an absolutely incredoble teacher. He cared so much for his students and was always willing to help. His loss will be deeply felt by all. We'll miss you Prof. Curtis!", "He's on leave for the semester, he was our department chair", "Hyde is by far the best professor I've had at SPSCC. His criminology class was extremely interesting and I learned a lot from him! The lectures could sometimes be dull but he would tend to tell personal stories to liven things up. The homework load was minimal and we hardly ever used the book in class. You need to take a class with Hyde!", "It's been \"awhile\" since law school...but, I thought Professor Frey was GREAT...he was my all time favorite law professor! He was always available...and willing to answer questions. He really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Marty ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!", "Such a great professor. Definitely one of the rare gems at highline. If you're taking psychology make sure to take it with Dr. Bob. Very inspirational! Loved this class!", "Dr. Langley was/is an amazing professor. I always found his sense of humor... well, humorous, and enjoyed the way he \"weeded out\" the \"not-so-bright\" individuals in our classes. He is the reason I graduated from college.", "The readings were very difficult and I found it way too easy to get lost in his discussions past the point of no return. However, he is an extraordinarily knowledgeable, charismatic, and funny man who truly cares about his students.", "His test are ****ing hard so get previous years test ie. go to the chem engg student society. The test questions are exactly the same kinda like econ201. He's bad at explaining things, main things in lectures are his research projects. Take PHYS369", "bad bad bad", "I had Briggs for pers. def. Each day we would start with a warm-up & then cont. on with learning basic self def. skills. Class was fairly easy there is a short midterm & final each had about 20 ques. For both midterm & final u hav to show him ur \"moves.\" He asks for a movement taught & u then have to do it, this is the 2nd pt. of the test. He's", "He's a creep.", "25 homework questions from each lecture. 150 homework questions every 4 weeks. Tests are 70 questions most of which are the exact homework questions. Some questions are easy & some extremely specific. All of this while doing a semester long group project. FML. Class definitely has its pros and cons. Expect that it will take a lot of time.", "He is very clear teacher. His tests are hard especially the final. It wasn't cumulative but it was EXTREMELY hard. He is willing to help which is very nice. You can take your papers in and have him look at them and he will grade them before you turn them in and give them back to you to correct. I would recommend him for anyone.", "Young is amazing! I suck at math but I got an A in this class (after getting a C in intermediate algebra which was taken online with an instructor that didn't always respond to requests for help in time for the test). For me, the A took quite a bit of intense work. Generous extra credit and fabulous DIY lecture videos were very much appreciated!", "Hahaha guys,pls give him a break. Math isn't an easy subject.First, you all should admirer him for being \"smarta$$\". Second, you should spend more time to study rather than sitting here complaining about him. He's a great professor. Although LB isn't a hottie but he's definitely a cutie[sometimes:)", "Jason is the best professor I've ever had!He LOVES subject he teaches.Very intelligent and fun/funny.Always prepared to explain/answer absolutely anything,and if he doesn't know atm he'll find it out for you!Jason helped out a lot with choosing IxDA as my major.He cares a lot about his subject and the students!Very excited for Sound Art with him.", "Paciocco is one of the top professors at the law school, and one of the best I've ever had. He has high expectations for his students, but he teaches well and sets out his expectations. His lectures are completely stimulating. There is a reason this man is so popular even though his courses are relatively difficult.", "Salloway really wants everyone to LEARN the material. very scatterbrained in terms of teaching style and thus sometimes hard to follow, but a wonderfully jolly and kind man (he looks like santa). He really knows his stuff and tries to make class worthwhile for students. His tests aren't easy, but he grades fairly and scales. A really great class!", "Currently taking the class online, Great professor...His book Compassion is very insightful. Easy grader in the sense that he values ur opinion and is very open to new arguements. Leaves constructive feedback on all papers. Reading the Book (Not difficult) Watch movies, do the papers and u'll do great :)", "Professor Potter is a really good and caring professor. He goes through his lectures at a good pace to make sure you get what you need. The only downside is that your graded on few things, but as long as you study hard its a great class to take.", "Funny in a very adorable, dorky way. Sometimes random, notes can be difficult to follow. Assigns a TON of homework and while none of it's ever due, I always felt bad knowing I had several hundred (no joke) calc problems I should be working on... tests are hard", "Incredibly caring, knowledgable, fair. Unfairly labelled by students who don't listen. His lectures are fascinating.", "Cuevas taught me how to write a college paper. He was great with feedback, very funny, and really able to relate to the students. He gives you a chance to revise your worst paper and earn points back. Very fair grader, and really wants his students to do well. Would definitely recommend.", "No Comments", "This guy does not speak english and is very hard to understand. you have to spend more time trying to understand what he says then what he is actually teaching!!!", "Nothing to fear in this class; it may look impossible at first, but it ends up being quite manageable. His bark is much worse than his bite. Make an effort to understand the material, and he'll make an effort to make sure you understand it.", "I'm currently taking him. His class is the easiest class i've ever taken. Not disrespecting him. I like to think i'm pretty tech savvy and i like technology, but for someone who doesn't use: word, excel, access, and somewhat hardware i can see them having a tougher time. Easy A. He is a fair grader, gives a lot of time for work, and tests.", "Very boring lecture. He has to curse a lot to get the students' attention. A good professor does not have to do that.", "great professor!", "Great prof. Clear and concise and knows his stuff.", "He is very nice and wants to help if you go to him for help. Read the material before class to actually understand what he is saying. Rewatching the lectures before the test also helps.", "Fred Smoler, is by far one of the finest professors in SLC. I was a part of his class by complete chance, and was so glad to be in his class. Can't wait to take his alternate history class coming up this semester. He is a brilliant teacher and truly inspirational.", "As a person he's a lot of fun but pretty hard grader. Lectures are boring and not quite consistent, exams don't seem to be super difficult but even if you gave a correct answer to question, you still can get much less points than expected. Would not recommend THIS.", "I liked him, but closed minded at times. He came from left field at times and condescending. Take him.easy essays, follows book...and will not let you sleep in class..", "Very helpful and knowledgable teacher. Assignments are assigned every class meeting, but not all are collected. If you pay attention in class you will be able to do the hw. Highly recommended.", "The tests can be difficult, but he prepares you well via in class lectures. He keeps the lectures engaging by constantly sharing anecdotes and telling jokes. Attendance is only 4% of the grade, but if you don't come to class, be prepared to fail.", "Professor Colasurdo is a great professor. He welcomes discussions and is knowledgeable about the subject. Even though I think Sociology is BS he made it tolerable for me. He's real easy to get along with. Easy A.", "No Comments", "This is my third time taking one of Kurylo's classes and I am still very happy with his teaching and testing techniques. The test are fairly difficult but there is always a curve & as long as you are a good note taker you will be fine. Also, read the stories and diagrams in the textbook, almost always at least one question related to them on exam", "Dr. McCauley is the best prof for this course. I was a bit scared going into this course because everything seemed so abstract at first but he dumbed everything down for us and made it all so crystal clear. By far, one of the best profs at York. His lectures were short, quick, and sweet. He is also very easy on the eyes;) I loved this class!", "AVOID AVOID AVOID!! VERY UNORGANIZED AND RANDOM.LATE ALLTHE TIME. YOU'RE LUCKY IF HE SHOWS UP FOR THE FINAL EXAM. TALKS WAY TOO LOW AND SLOWLY. LECTURES DO NOT COINCIDE WITH THE READINGS. GRADES EXAMS HARSHLY. HE MAKES THINGS MORE DIFFICULT THAN THEY HAVE TO BE AND IT'S ONLY A 300-LEVEL CLASS", "!!!", "I am very disappointed in this class. I have decided against taking any asl classes because of this instructor. I have also changed my major because of this class.", "Awesome teacher. Really knows his geometry. Very clear. Explains very well , and has always helped me even when I wasn't his student.", "Very interested in actually having his students LEARN...even if its not on the syllabus. He will gladly spend time to discuss topics related to the class (or exercise in general) if it will benefit the class and if its interesting for the students. Very available outside of class.", "Yes, he erases problems fast, but he really has a heart. If you're failing, he will try to accommodate you. If you're in there the first week and can't keep up with him, don't drop the class because he gets better.", "Very interesting class! Very well done with some fun humor thrown in. If you love to read and can read fast, this is certainly a class you'll enjoy. Even if you can't get to the reading on a particular week, sparknotes and whatever else will suffice. Very fun!", "good professor. tests can be hard so make sure you read. he occasionally is funny with his weird sense of humor, keeps class interesting. you can tell he enjoys teaching.", "very rude to some of the students in class, has favorites, text is boring and sometimes hard to comprehend, quizes are over minor details in the text", "It's alittle boring.There is alot to learn. Take notes. Write down everything he will putit in the tests/", "No Comments", "He brags about his accomplishments a lot instead of covering material that needs to be covered. He is always at least 15 minutes late to class, but if you leave he holds it against you. He loses assignments frequently and won't take fault, even though there are 10 people with missing assignments", "After reading the comments, I'd say he's getting better at teaching. Probably only his 3rd or 4th year teaching. He's a good teacher, but I wouldn't miss a single class cause he'll ignore you if you skip.", "This is the most terrible professor I ever had. Refuses to answer questions. He has admitted many times he does not know how to do some of the homework problems. The average on the open book tests are always about 50 percent. I have gotten all A's in college and got a C in this class. He will not curve tests. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROFESSOR!!", "Best class ever, I just took this class to fill some of G.E credit but it was more than what I expected. You have to take notes or printed them out, you also have online quizzes and hw (easy), and some problems sets. The tests are multiple choice and also short answer questions. I really recommend this class.", "I took his 5 week accounting 1 class and got an A . Homework assignments are as clear as ever . He uses connect from McGraw hill for the entire class . The homework assignments have video examples that teach you how to solve the problems. Use all ur connect resources and you will pass . Make sure to do extra credit , it really matters.", "Travisano is the man. If you go to class everyday (which is worth it because his lectures are always hilarious) then you will have no problem getting an A even if you don't read the books.", "I STRONGLY dislike this man. Class is interesting enough, but he spends the whole time talking about these interesting case studies and experiments... that do not help you at all on the test. The weekly quizzes are a pain and regularly going to class and reading book won't help you on the tests.", "Even though we are slightly past midterms, I have thoroughly enjoyed his class. When I decided to take his class many people told me not to take it, but he is very personable. The best way to pass his class is to write down what's on the board and then refer back to the book to take more in depth notes. I will definitely be taking his class again.", "Easiest teacher for this course. Barely any effort required and easy final. 2 Assignments a week, Group project, and Final. Take him for that easy pass on 91L", "really easy class! you do two essay and take two tests one which doesn't even count. both papers are 7 pages each but he requires you to first turn in a 5 page then 6 page of them so you can expand it into a 7 page. as long as you DO IT you get an A.", "Excellent teacher. He explains everything very clearly, and keeps the class going at a manageable pace. If you don't understand something, he will work with you until you get it. If you're really interested in something, he'll encourage you further in it.", "prof clear is an awesome teacher. very knowledgable and informative. cordial and friendly with students. uses interesting anecdotes and tidbits to make information relative. has a great teaching manner. take his classes if you can.", "Good prof although when he talks about all the studies it can be a real snooze. The papers are short and easy. His exams r easy too if you take the practice exams.", "No Comments", "Mixed feelings on this professor. The work load was extremely difficult. I hated the group component of the course - it would have been very useful if our grade didn't depend on it. He's fair in his grading (aside from the group grade) and the subject matter is interesting. The lectures were a bit dry and he expects a great deal workwise.", "The hardest class i have ever taken, he teaches as if we are all moving on to pursue our careers in medicine it's ridiculous IT'S AP HIGH SCHOOL BIO! HARD TESTS! STUDY YOUR ASS OFF! I wouldn't recommend him if you are only taking this course just to take a 100 level science and a lab but if you are pursuing in nursing take him.", "Hilarious teacher. Very knowledgable in his area of study.", "nice guy, but can be biased in his grading. he has favorites in his classes. makes his classes fun to attend.", "Took him for Physio & Animal Bhvr. WORST TEACHER EVER! It is seriously a poverty to this school that they keep a man like this on their payroll. Example: he showed a video one class. Next class he says he was sorry, he showed the wrong one. He was there watching the whole video! Also, his review questions might as well be used on Mad Gab. AVOID!", "Exam is difficult, but assignments are fun.", "Take as much notes as possible. His tests are a bit difficult, but if you study your notes you can actually do good!!!", "Reminds you of a really cool grandpa with plenty of stories. Likes to make jokes and tries to keep your attention by saying some pretty controversial stuff. This guy is hilarious. 3 100 pt tests that's it. Invest in flash cards because you need to know a lot of info for tests. Great teacher, great man.", "Interesting class, but super tough and dense material. There was a ton of reading and most of it was difficult to get through. He's a tough marker but fair, and he interacts with the material really well. Not a GPA booster, and I'd avoid if you have an already heavy course-load.", "Hes a samrt dude who learns from the kids in class as he teaches them.. In touch with kids our age. Knows whatsup.", "Best first year Biology teacher. Really knows his stuff and knows the perfect way to explain everything so that you understand it. Very good at pacing himself. Also very helpful if you show concern.", "good guy, taught well, decent tests", "Really knows his stuff. Seems like he's just putting in time though.", "Dr S is so great! He is by far the coolest professor I've had so far. He really cares about his students and his Skeptics Manifesto class is awesome! So if you're an honors student--definitely take this course!", "Doesnt know his job.I'm not sayin this b/c apparently U THINK I'm failing this class.U prolly never took so many damn classes at the same time or else u would know how much work is involved & if U cant take criticism well,this website is not for u.Peace!", "Professor Hage is awesome. Take his class, I drive 45 minutes to get to class but I do not regret it. His notes are very clear and his test are based on his notes. If you study your notes before test you would pass his class with a good grade.", "Nice professor!", "Mr. Teti is one of the best teachers period I wish he taught everything. He's cool, easy going, kind, helpful, great at explaining the work, and this helps you get it, just all around great!!!! oh and the work was modest and exams pretty easy and im no math geek...TAKE HIM OVER THE OTHERS!", "Take this class. Without a doubt the most inspirational professor I have ever had. He was one of the reasons I chose to come to this college. You won't be disapointed.", "Preston Allen was one of the most weirdest but funniest professors I ever had. He would make a few face expressions that would make a few students laugh. He is straight forward with the work during the semester and how he want things done. You'll have around 3-4 essays with feedback provided after each one. Overall, great professor and you'll learn", "I like the guy as a person but not as a teacher. He makes you think and if you simply don't get it, he makes you feel dumb. I never made anything higher than a 60 on his tests and I love math and have always been good at it. Do not take if you're not a math genious.", "John Burton is a first rate professor and a superb anthropologist. His language and symbolism class made me decide to major. Eloquent, smart, with a wry sense of humor. Highly recommend Africa course too. Treats students as young anthropologists and never talks down. Can't recommend him enough!", "Prof. George gives hard tests, a lot of the time asking specific questions, he is very knowledgable about the subject and even though he doesnt take attendance showing up on days when everyone else doesnt results in bonus points on exams which are needed", "I hated the class, but Professor Fox was really helpful. He was incredibly nice and super patient. He was a joy, but I'm glad the class is over!", "The prof is ok. The material is easy, but not the 2 tests. Huge amount of easy calculation in short time and you need show them in details are not easy even the tests are very straight forward. The marker is a litter bit tough. You must attend to tutorial if you want good mark, the TA give your hint of exam.", "Boring ass class. He drones on and on about BS the whole time. Considering i almost never go and still have a Pass, its simple****. When your sitting in class, it feels like when a cop talks to you if you did something bad and about how bad it was. God he is boring. -_-", "No Comments", "hes one of those professors that people either hate or love. if youre good at math and hard working then youll do fine. if youre lazy and kinda bad at math dont take him! also math homework is online and its terrible. probably the only really bad thing. but hes super nice and extends homework all the time. curves at end based on overall class grade", "Hard..We are lucky to have a professor who is so excited about the material and teaching", "He is actually funny and very passionate about chemistry. He understands that this class is a lower level chemistry class and doesn't require you to know things above this class. He responds to questions quickly and helped with any problem I had. You are responsible to teach yourself. This class is in no way a breeze go to class and read your book.", "Without a doubt, the worst bio prof I've ever had!", "No Comments", "HE IS AWESOME- i love halfman because he is just a nice guy that will answer any question you have and never make you feel dumb- he is great- take any class of his!", "Professor Stecker is probably the cutest and sweetest professor at CMU. He always cracks jokes and though you can't read his handwriting, he tries his best. He assigns readings, but usually hands out kind of confusing notes that go along with the readings. The quizzes & essays are directly from the notes he gives you. Overall a great guy!!", "He's really smart and a good teacher. He gives a lot of extra credit for showing up to review sessions and open labs and will explain things you have problems with. He's my favorite A&P prof I've had so far.", "Didn't he discover how the pyramids were built or something?", "Hes an overall great guy who's passion for films is evidently conveyed through he's lectures and comments. He has helped me become more critical in my analyzing of films and has created my love for French New wave cinema.", "Constantly singing, very active, brings tremendous energy to the classroom. Minimal pointless memorization and wasted time.", "Not a bad choice for EC 110. He has dry humor. I made an A- in his class and studied a day or two before the test. I'm not very smart either.", "Amazing teacher if you are willing to put in the time. He goes out of his way to make sure every student understands. Can be extremely creative in his teaching methods. Student needs to be responsible or he will not keep up.", "Mr. Hu is a great professor and can be quite humorous! I took him for both Math 40 & 60. He takes attendance by use of daily quizzes and these will add up, so come to class! We did massive amounts of homework especially during the summer but it was always out of the book and not online :) ! His exams can be tough so prepare yourself by studying!", "Fun guy, knows a lot about art history and classes aren't to difficult if you do the readings.", "I enjoyed getting an easy A from Balbula and watching all the Shakespeare films, but I regret having left the class with about just as much knowledge on the bard as when I entered.", "he is teaching himself not teaching student, , he is talking to himself only , it's hardly to listen what is talking about.", "Just read the powerpoint. So boring.", "Funny, interesting, knowledgeable and an overall great teacher and person.", "Make sure you do as many practice problems as you can to prepare for the test. The test will be much harder then other classes so study and put in the hours. There is no clear grading criteria even though he says there is in the syllabus. I still have no idea what my final numeric grade was. Take a different professor if at all possible", "Uh!", "Pretty good teacher, in the truest sense of the word. Not very nice when you ask questions, however most of his meanness is said jokingly. He is very clear in what he wants. His tests are pretty hard.", "the only thing for your grade is 3 in class essays. and the lectures sometimes dont nessisarily relate to the midterms. however you can get all of the information by either reading the book, or going to the TA/SI led sessions", "I had Professor Janz for intro to religion. He's super nice, the class was easy, and I actually LEARNED the material! His tests are relatively easy, although he tends to focus on dates. Don't let that scare you-the only way to get less than a B in any class he teaches is by not coming or taking notes!", "TOOK THE 6 WEEK WINTER CLASS AND IT WAS FAIRLY EASY. HE'S VERY AVAILABLE TO HELP WITH QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. GREAT CLASS.", "No Comments", "Professor Sierra's class could not be any easier. I definitely liked the fact that there was no homework compared to the other TA teacher. Go to class, stay for the movies, jot down the notes, and review before the test. THERE IS NO REASON YOU SHOULD NOT GET AN A IN THIS CLASS!", "He usually wasn't late by over 1-2 minutes. He is a busy guy, cut him some slack. The tests were fair and if you got the prep work you'd do well. If you're bad at math don't blame him, he was a funny guy yet still taught well. Unlike many math profs, he DIDN'T just copy the book. All the processes were right even if he made a few mistakes with #s.", "A very nice man. A really good class, could get a little boring at times, but overall I would recommend him. As long as you read and do all the assignments you will be fine. He is also a big Disney and Harry Potter freak. He's a great guy", "Prof. Corvino is awesome! Make sure you come to class and read the material and you will do just fine. His TA's were awesome too. Very helpful and clear!", "Very funny professor! 80% of his lecture is him telling stories. He gives out extra credit questions when attendance is low. Exams are really tricky! A lot of stuff is on them that was never covered in class. Also is slow to respond to emails, and to grade.", "I had to do a lot of work, but it paid off.", "(Ethics) He is a cool dude because he doesn't have a set agenda to class. He doesn't assign h/w but has a couple tests which are rather easy if you fill out your work book. The material covered in class is important, but what he grades more on is your opinions and your values/views. Pretty cool dude if you ask me....", "good guy tries hard but is about past his prime. can be a useful professor but will take some patience.", "No Comments", "Dr. Andy is the best! The class was very eye opening, and Dr. Andy allowed us a lot of flexibility as far as creativity is concerned! The reader is amazing, I will pass it onto my kids. The assignments may seem unclear at points, but really, you realize Dr. Andy just wants you to materialize the assignment into anything you like. Best teacher", "I thought it would be easy so didnt work as hard as I should have. He teaches in stories but is somewhat interesting. You have to pay attention. Easy class but make sure you are not sidetracked and actually try to listen or you will have to re-learn everything he says before the tests.", "HORRIBLE!! run away, NOW! Worst prof and class ever. I thought it would be really interesting but I was wrong. I never thought it was possible to make something so boring.", "dr. ovadia is one cool guy. the class is mainly a discussion forum as opposed to a lecture. just read 6 books and talk about them, as well as a short reaction paper after each book. you have to talk in class, though. he took everyone to starbucks on the first day and paid. awesome guy, definately take him.", "Worst prof ever. I basically taught myself everything in that course. HORRIBLE explanations! When I went in for help he seemed like he had no interest in helping me. I will NEVER EVER take a class from him again.", "This man will reply to your e-mail in less than 5 mins. i swear! Very hard for intro to media industries much easier for internship seminar. in all, fantastic professor, super passionate about what he teaches. by far, the most useful class i have taken at fordham", "Great teacher. You have to read your notes and and the book to do well on the 100 questions test-but the questions are pretty straightforward. Interesting class.", "Dr. Bakker is very prepared for lectures and is great about answering questions in class and outside of class. He loves to see his students putting in effort, so go to office hours when you have questions and attend as many recitations as possible (his quizzes there help a lot, too!) Use all extra problems he gives and it will help for the tests.", "I can say very honestly that I learned nothing. He actually discussed what a cowboy is, what a cowgirl is, the fact that young woman love horses and really anything but geography. He was very scatter brained, unorganized and unclear. Three eight hour long field trips, so this should be more like a six credit course. Do not take his classes!", "These comments are clearly from people who don't want to put in the work. If you really want to major in EM and it's the right place for you, you will enjoy Dr R and his courses. Loves what he does and definitely gives a lot of work but it all has a purpose and I'm better for it all.", "This man cracks me up! I absolutely love going to his class everyday! He is an awesome teacher! I think everyone needs to take a lit class with him! Yah, go DB!", "Very fun class, not at all boaring.", "He made me hate international politics. Should not be teaching lower level classes.", "This guy is definitely worth taking.------Pros: 1) you gain an overall understanding of anything he covers. 2) he explores new ideas with the class. 3) most open-minded person I have ever met.------Cons: 1) you read a LOT of books that I would not consider \"easy reads\" 2) you write a LOT (in the fresman seminar).------ 20% participation. so talk.", "He started out motivated and interesting but after mid-terms barely taught at all, leaving the majority of time for lab time (uh: in-class WOW, IM and facebook anyone?) and general skipping. His notes are a dump of information which he mined for obscure things not taught/glossed over in class for mid-term and finals.", "pointless information, stutters and babbles, hard to pay attention", "Dr. Burns is definitely a person you need to learn about project management from. We went to visit some local IT companies and met with some of Dr. Burns' students. Everyone said the same things that the materials Dr. Burns taught in class were helpful and useful for their careers!", "Duane is a little quirky and kind of out there but overall a great professor. I took this class as a sophomore and expected to get my butt kicked. He's really helpful though and wants you to do well. He doesn't really give many grades and tests were very general. Field trips are interesting, definitely a lot of work but it could've been a lot worse", "Super class. Nice guy, helpful, easy to understand.", "A true historian in every sense of the word. He made the history come to life....power point slides and stories of a personal nature that glued me to my seat. Considered changing my major from Bible to History.....great Professor", "The class is very easy if you actually go to all of the lectures and pay attention. His tests were not hard at all. Plus he was very easy going and listened to any concerns you had.", "Ted is incredibly knowledgable and well-prepared. His lectures are very fast paced. You need to take notes on a lot of what he says, and not just rely on the powerpoints he posts on NYU Classes. He is not always clear but is willing to help.", "Terrific teacher in every facet. He has perfected the teaching of E321.", "Wow...hard course to begin with, but the lecture diagrams didn't make it any easier.", "Dr. Burns is a nice professor. I love to hear his real life stories. Lectures are kind of interesting. Some slides are wordy but you need to read them to pass the test. We form one team during semester and deliver many reports so expect to write a lot. There are 3 homework sets and 3 closed notes, closed books exams. Overall, thump up!", "Take his SOC 110 class! I loved going to his classes. Most days he told stories that made this class great.", "I personally don't like him very much, his class is SO boring. I can't focus at all and pretended to throw up two different times just so I could leave. If his midterm wasn't take home I would have gotten a 0 because he can't teach. 20 page paper, presentation, midterm, final. Those are your grades.. don't screw any up!", "He does an awesome job with a course that lends itself to being boring and hard to work with. You might be able to learn more if you took this class with a judge, but this guy definitely does a great job and relates concepts to reality very well.", "No Comments", "the note Nazi - could we have a little more information presented in a dry and boring way", "Craig is AMAZING!!! He's a really cool guy and knows what he's talking about. There are 4 tests total, which are hard, but he gives over 100pts extra credit so it's like one bad test didn't happen. It's Man & ENVIRONMENT so you do go out almost everyday but I loved it. It was so fun and interactive. Great teacher who's passionate and cares", "I got 100's on all assignments, and ended up with a C in the class.He will not change a grade, even when wrong Attendance is MANDATORY. I thought the class was extremely easy. Even if you work 10x harder,turn everything in on time or never miss a class he won't use that in your favor. The final had things we never learned or talked about in class.", "He's an awesome professor! If you pay attention and copy all his class notes, you can easily get an A in his class. We had a quiz every Friday (about 3-5 questions) and 4 tests in total. He does assign homework, but it's just so you can get extra practice and he doesn't even grade it. I will definitely take him again!", "Uninteresting way of presenting interesting material.", "Class is pretty easy. Gives extra credit when he takes attendance. Lectures are decent.", "An amazing prof who has heard and seen it all and will let you have it if he suspects you of BSing or laziness. Those who accuse him of being \"mean\" missed his point completely. His relentless prodding is the effort of a man who genuinely cares about his students. Don't listen to the bitter students who couldn't take the heat; he's the best at SSU.", "Jim is very demanding and expects you to give 110% at all times. He is also extremely helpful, and makes time to help you if you ask for it. Also, if you get a good grade in his class, you have EARNED it. His ideas are a bit out there for the mainstream, but keep an open mind and you'll make it!", "Best art teacher hands down, I learned so much from his classes and improved dramatically under his wing. He definitely cares about his students and will go the extra mile for students!", "Teacher that cares about his students. He's very organized - he's almost obsessed about it, but it's a good thing because his lectures are organized, but u may have to record his lectures because he gives so much info n leaves no time for daydreaming. If u blank out for 1 minute u are lost in space!", "This professor made too many mistakes in his grading. He was also was very unprofessional about it because he did not care to fix the grades, unless you chased him down.", "I walked out of this class not learning a thing. He gives pop quizzes so you have to read the books which are so boring. He's funny, I actually enjoyed the class. All we did was watch youtube videos. The little work you do have, he is such a hard grader and very unclear on the actual assignment, all of us were always confused on what he wanted.", "Secret is going to his study sessions. Great teacher, really funny, holds attentions, learned a lot.", "No Comments", "awesome teacher, only wish he didnt have to leave for surgery.....we all miss his teaching. Def. understanding and polite and everything you could ask for of a teacher", "This class is extremely straight forward. Dr. Perkins literally wrote the book for this class. This means do what he says, and you will make an A. Unfortunately, he asks a lot with homework assignments nearly every class. However, if you just put a little bit of time into the class throughout the semester, it will be one of your easiest classes.", "He gives a lecture every class, and you watch a movie after that. You need to attend class (even if you have seen the movie) in order to take notes (he tells you what you need to know for the exams). 2 exams, and one research project. Easy class, he is sarcastic and funny. You need to read the book.", "He has a few 'senior moments' but theirs 3 tests and you need to study from the book and do the problems, o you will have problems. I would recommend him.", "I find Dr. Sharif very difficult to understand. His accent is thick, his handwriting is messy, and his lecture notes are unorganizated. He's a lecturer that works examples without telling you what your solving for, what topic you're on, etc. He also wastes a lot of class time waiting for the class to participate when no one knows the answer.", "A little quirky, but generally a very sweet guy and great teacher. I'm not good at math, but he's very approachable and will answer any questions you have (over break or offce hours) Obviously very passionate about math. Take him if you have the chance :)", "andy jones is an extremely nice, kind, teacher. always willing to help you out. However this class TCS191 needed a lot of work. What are we learning? What is going on? What is the purpose? I have never been so lost, yet not? in a class before... ... what?", "if you're interested in plants, agriculture, pigs, cows and chickens, then take this course. assignments are long but marked pretty easily. no midterm, exam is not bad. interesting, but can sometimes completely lose you.", "Good if you are prepared to take responsibility for your learning and review a lot outside of class", "Salvo is the best, if you played band in high school, you really need to in college. Band with him is so fun!", "Dr. Bosworth is a very kind, brilliant man. The definitions killed on the quizzes and final, but he does grade very generously. My advice is to go over previous class assignments, and dedicate a couple hours a week to go over the notes and really memorize the material.", "Frishkoff is one of the biggest ****s I've met in my entirety, seriously, didn't make the class fun, interesting, or anything worth coming to. The worst teacher at the University of Oregon", "He is monotone when no one answers his questions but loves participation and enjoys joking. If you pay attention in lab and lecture you will do great. The course packet was all I used...bought the book for nothing. He is very helpful in lab and gives you different ways to learn the material. All-in-all a great professor.", "jerk.Not helpful at all. Don't waste your time & money.", "This guy is something! He will make you either laugh, or cry. The Map exam is easy, the other 2 I guess too, cause if you read book and notes u'll be fine. Just know the stuff he assigned for the particular day.", "No Comments", "He is so passionate about parasites and makes you get excited about them too. It's a lot of memorization and on the tougher side but I would take this class again hands down! He is really reasonable with his students and with his work load. Seriously a very interesting class with a really funny and passionate professor. Highly recommend him!", "You. Must. Read. The. Assigned. Reading. You must. Otherwise the tests will be more difficult than they have to be and you won't understand his lectures as easily. He will also try and scare you out of his class in the beginning but don't be fooled. Only if you are willing to attend should you take this class. Excellent teacher.", "Dr.Hardy is the most incompetent teacher I have ever had the displeasure of knowing. Had I not known math before I started his class, I would be failing. He is VERY RUDE and is completely disinterested in his students. If you aren't black he doesnt care about you. So if you are going to take his class, white people, you better get a tan!!!", "this guy is an old trailer trash proff who thinks he's some kind of king cause he has his PHD. his exams are crap and his turtle necks don't help. he's a sessional that thinks he has some kinda pull since he is stuck on the 5th floor on his knees.", "12 (five question) MC quizzes, 12 (SUPER EASY) lab reports, 1 (10 question) MC midtermessay portion, 1 (10 question) MC finalessay portion.

I didn't learn anything but hey I got an A+", "If you were good in physics in high school, good for you. This is so much harder! Had A's in h.s., now barely passing. Does not give partial credit! grrr! not very helpful. thinks he's easy but he isnt. takes attendance everyday!", "I did not elect to seek Panos in his office hours, mainly because I had classes during all of his hours. This hurt my grade significantly as he does not clearly outline the expectations on the papers during class time. Had I gone to hours I likely wouldn't have had this issue.", "He was probably one of the best teachers I've had so far; he was clear and enthusiastic. However, I heard from a professor that he had passed away a couple of weeks ago, which I sadly confirmed through an online news article on legacy.com that said he had passed on 10/19/2011. He will be dearly missed.", "no cell phones in class - NEVER forget to turn it off or he will bust you a new one. Don't be late. He is not easy, but he knows his stuff.", "Jim is a great guy; he'll do anything to help you. Which is not to say he spoonfeeds you. You have to do the work, although not necessarily all that he tells you to do. And you know, I came in expecting to be bored out of my mind, but he does a great job breaking up lecture with good discussion. If you need genetics, this is the way to go.", "I had professor B for 5 classes and now a 6th. Obviously I think he is a great teacher. If you do the reading and writings on time, and participate you can do well. A lotta reviews say he is scary which I totally get but it's mainly because he wants you to work hard. He also does not tolerate foolishness.", "He makesaid class time highly amusing, and he is very knowledgeable in the subject area.", "He is the BEST!!!!", "He was one of the best teachers I have ever had. He taught practical application in his class. He did not give you a grade that you did not earn. If you participate and do your work , you should pass.", "Avoid at all cost", "Snider is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He's pretty funny, and he learns your name very quickly. The work is not very hard, and he gives you a lot of extra assignments to make up for less than desirable quiz/exam grades.", "Great GUY", "He is so intelligent and his lectures are very interesting. All classes should be like his, where you actually leave the class with knowledge about the topic and a different way of thinking.", "This was probably the easiest class of all four years, and very fun. He tries to get to know the students, but doesn't really know all so you could just get a friend to sign you in and you would be marked present. He definitely knows his facts so make sure your powerpoints have lots of pics of the correct places!", "This guy wants to make the game design course easy for you, though he doesn't necessarily know all the answers. You can ignore what you get on the tests as long as it's anywhere near passing, the only thing that matters is the final project. You must take that project seriously - it's not \"fake\" like in other blow-off classes.", "rambles uncontrollably. In general he is a nice guy but completely out of his league teaching accounting. He reads straight off the slides that are all posted on sakai & can barely answer questions. His whole section of the lodmod project is a mess and he cant even help you because he is using another professors outline. This class is a mess", "Straight facts: His tests are difficult, he usually never has homework(depending on which class you take), he will share information or images from criminal minds with you that you will find no where else, and he will make you grow as a CRJ/PLS major. He is hard but necessary. Attend class and you will pass. Excellent professor.", "Barden is amazing, he explains micro without torturing you like some other teachers. He is more keen on you understanding the larger picture and wants you to apply logic also during his exams. I loved his lectures, his hilarious so that helps, and always open for you to pop up during office hours for extra clarification. Hands down my fav prof :)", "He is very boring and enjoys listening to himself talk. Instead of discussing the philosophy articles, he would just ask students what they thought. So no one learned anything. He is a nice guy, but his class is super boring. Only 2 exams (midterm and final both take home) and two other exams. His quizzes, although only 10 questions are misleading", "He loves what he teaches. Funny. Teaches until the last second. His lectures are scattered around sometimes. Very nice and always willing to help you, or answer any questions. Tests are pretty hard, in my opinion. Do not just study the 'study guide' he gives you! Study everything! Notes, diagrams, AND book info! Overall, great teacher. :o)", "Anthro 245? Don't do it. You'll just watch movies and probably learn nothing. And then the class ends up being pretty hard.", "Excellent professor, and you must participate in class and read assigned material.", "McMcDonald was a great teacher. He wanted you to succeed and was extremely helpful. I am an adult student and struggle in math and he never made me feel like I couldn't do it. I'd take him for all of my math classes if I could!! I had to drop at the end of the semester due to other issues and will take him again if he is teaching.", "He is a great professor if you are one of his favourites. He will also dumb down his classes until they are all discussions that do not require reading the text book. The classes end up being a waste of time. I would choose not to attend, but it is mandatory.", "Made the class a lot more difficult than it should have been. Didn't give clear instructions and started changing the material half way through it. Expect to spend rediculous amounts of time in the lab.", "No Comments", "The papers and exams are very hard...but I worked very hard to get a B in the end but was bell-curved down to a C because the class average had to be 60. =(", "Tries to engage the class, and have them participate which is nice. Really seems to have enthusiasm and want students to learn and better themselves as writers. Can be really intimidating at times and overpowering though, also grades rather harshly so don't be fooled into thinking this class is easy. HARD WORK + PERFECT ATTENDANCE = AVERAGE GRADE.", "he's an ok teacher, sometimes he scares the students. He scares the students at first; but as the semester goes on, he becomes more lenient.", "Don't take him if you plan on taking Dynamics. He is supposed to be pretty good with Fluid Mechanics, but he wasn't very comfortable teaching Dynamics.", "Dr. Bakker's class was very difficult and not to be taken lightly. During class he tries to be funny, but often goes over as rude and demeaning. He has many times worked a problem out on the board and not explained where he gets the numbers from. He seems like a brilliant man, but not very good at teaching. I wouldn't recommend taking him.", "I have never known an educator more self-absorbed than Griffin. His classes, when not completely empty of substance, involve lectures pertaining to topics that only he would find relevant. No clarity in assignments or grading criteria. A discouraging presence in the classroom.", "Once you get past the bragging and pompous attitude he is actually really nice. Class is not too difficult and set up so you learn more than just hearing lectures all the time.", "Big disappointment, avoid this prof and class", "Great professor and has interesting lectures. Although he lacks group projects and even though his lectures are interesting, if you don't love listening to lectures they can get kinda boring. TIP: for the test, go to his lecture notes on canvas and hit Ctrl+F on your keyboard. It's an open test so you can do word search on notes to get the answers.", "Always well prepared, entertaining and educational - always learned something and was never bored. Lots of writing assignments but tests are open notes (but hard). Come to class, do the work - you will get an A.", "I agree with the other comment that he isn't for the faint of heart (I was ready to drop the 2nd day; but I found him to be fair, have a sense of humor & give many opportunities to improve your grade. You'll need support from the Lab since he's very short on explanations but in the end I enjoyed being in his class, passed the compass & made an A!", "I LOVED him.VERY cool.Willing to stay late and help those who need it and teaches slowly and patiently.Even lets you call him Todd!!(lol)Made us feel like he was a friend tutoring us rather than a prof. math is NOT my subject..but he was totally cool and very helpful..and his tests are pretty easy,too!!", "He is an incredible instructor for Database Fundamentals - funny, gives good analogies, and is extremely quick-witted. You could ask him anything related to databases and he would give you a well-thought out answer on the spot. Whenever a student had a question, he didn't mind taking the time to explain things over. Would highly recommend.", "the best prof ever", "Text for Stress Mgmt class unnecessary & waste of money, all covered in class. Dont see why the book is required. Spouting personal opinions & insulting medical documents is unprofessional.

Incredibly nice and willing to work with students. Show up for 121 and you're practically guaranteed to pass", "Mr. Ballantyne is an amazing teacher. You are allowed to miss six classes without it effecting your grade. There are 4 to 5 speeches. As long as you keep improving and meet the required time you'll get an A or B. Just do not miss the day of your speech because you can NOT make it up, you will receive a zero. VERY kind and caring. Wants you to pass!", "He might be an interesting guy and professor, who knows a lot about the subject. But definitely not the best professor for Immanuel Kant. His class makes Kant more difficult and confusing than it should be.", "He is a great Prof. He knows what he is doing. His beard is also very hot and his silver hair makes him distinguished.", "Consider yourself lucky if you have the priviledge of being in prof. Lank's class. It is rare to encounter a teacher who so genuinely cares for and believes in his students. Certainly more than just an entrepreneurship course- prof. Lank's eloquent lectures inspire you to do better.", "Attendance not taken at lecture but necessary to attend to include lecture notes in essays. Multiple choice q's can be tricky. Class was quite enjoyable overall.", "Definitely not an easy A, but he is very interested in what he is teaching and is willing to help you no matter what. Such a genuine guy. I'd recommend him for sure.", "awesome guy!!! had a great time in his class, learned alot and he is extremely efficient in getting papers marked and returned. hes really helpful if your stuck and is extremely approachable!!! Would definately take another class with him!!!", "Wants everyone to do things his way, Unfortunately the wrong way", "The best math teacher hands down!! I took him for math 1111 and math 1113 and always had the mindset that I was going to fail cause I'm so bad with math. But he made everything different, very helpful! You would need to make a lot of time for his class but worth taking! Take him! You won't regret it!", "This teacher is honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. In Philosophy, you are allowed to have an opinion, but not in his class. This class is full of work that has nothing to do with Philosophy. It has hurt me in other classes because I spend so much time on his homework that is busy work. I pretty sure I got an A in his class. :(", "If you can understand conceptual math by reading, then I suggest this course. Otherwise, you should take a lecture course. As long as you read and do the assignments, you can pass. They provide hints and explain how to solve several of the problems. However, if you're an accounting major, this probably won't help you memorize well.", "Smartest professor at UM. He is extremely detailed because in addition to being a genius, he was actually a partner at Cravath, so he practice experience. He likes you to be exact, and sometimes he goes really deep into problems that won't be on the exam. He isn't an easy grader either. Hilarious and makes you think hard. Cool guy to talk to.", "meh", "Mike is a total Boss. Best instructor I've had at NAIT.", "Dr. Cherry is a great professor. It's a discussion based classed with a relaxed atmosphere where people can share their ideas about the text. You need to read in order to do well, but he chooses good texts for the class. He has a great sense of humor, and is clear about what he expects you to accomplish in your papers. I recommend taking his class.", "Hey was horrible, expected you to understand everything the first time he spoke of something. If you are struggling he makes things harder and expects more. If your an athlete DO NOT take this class.", "Dr. Dowd is one of the most memorable professors I've had at Miami. He cares for the students and enjoys what he does.", "Well,he is the best I think. Language is a thing that you have to work hard, and he well helps to do it.", "Doc is a fantastic professor. It's obvious how much he loves jazz. He plays favorites for sure, but if you prove yourself to him as a musician, he'll have more faith in you.", "Made the class more reasonable than I expected it to be. notes got repetative from the middle of the semester on, so you actually have to pay attention to pick out what's new. always willing to help", "This class is no doubt an easy A. You pay attention and do good on the tests your good.", "He's pretty easy, and if you already know what you're doing, I highly recommend him. He's got the clearest accent of any of the Indian professors except maybe Teredesai. If you're shaky on material though, avoid. You won't learn enough from him.", "TAKE THIS CLASS! There are quite a few writing assignments, but you have a ton of time to do them. If you do the work, you'll get a good grade.

If he's an option for whatever class you're picking, pick him for sure.", "This is a clear cut, do the work, ask questions when you need to, and you'll get a good grade guy. Fair, funny, and good in a subject a lot of teachers are not.", "I had him 6 years ago and I still remember him being the most excellent professor I have had. To be able to sustain the attention of a 300+ students in an Intro to Psych class is amazing. He is the reason I chose Psychology as my major.", "Worst teahcer I've had so far. He rambles on forever and no one has a clue what he is talking about. Very confusing lectures and is very difficult to take notes on. Don't waste your time trying to stay awake in his class.", "Worst teacher I ever had. I'm in Grad school out of state but found this site and thought I should share this with everyone. I got an A, but it still wasn't worth it.", "Its true that Dr. Gordon is always. It is also true that he quite possibly one of the most unorganized professors I have ever had. He probably will never give your paper back, or any feedback BUT, having said that he is probably the best professor I have ever had. He doesn't even try and I have learned so much in his classes.", "If you go to class and study the practice test, you will be fine. HE is very straightforward about what will be on the tests. ANyone who got less that an A in his class shuld be ashamed of themselves.", "I took his SOSC 301 class online and it was great. It was very straightforward. Everything came from the textbook. It was an easy A for me. And he was always helpful and emailed back right away.", "The worst lectures to be present for. So monotone and boring. Asks if there are any questions and then acts like you are inconveniencing him when you actually do have one.

Surprisingly tough grader on the minimal amount of work assigned.", "His second year after getting his PHD and has no clue how to teach upper division course.

Highly recommend him as a professor, he really promotes discussions and debate. Great teacher and got me interested in philosophy", "Awesome teacher. If you go in to see hi, before a paper is due to get his feedback and help, you will get no less than an A-. He is clear about what he wants and is extremely eager to help his students. It is so clear how much he cares for his students. He truly wants them to learn and will do anything he can to help them excel. TAKE LABARGE", "Dr. Bob is the best teacher I have ever had. He is respectable, friendly, funny, and brilliant. On the first day he gives you all of the essential information needed to pass the class, it can feel overwhelming at first but it's incredibly helpful. He fulfills his promise of teaching you all there is to know about Human Relations. Highly recommend!", "Great overview of computer technology.

If you are the type of person that likes your work back right away, stay away from Tim. He does a great job making the class interesting, but is not very good at keeping the class on topic.

I hope to be able to take more of Dr. Allard's classes in the future.", "I had him for Intermediate 2. DO NOT TAKE HIM. He is a waste of your time, he is paranoid that everyone is out to get him, and you learn nothing about ceramics in his class. At this stage in my course outline, I should be doing all firings myself. He has taken my work and fired it. I have no idea what he did or why he did it. DO NOT TAKE HIM.", "While he does not give as much homework as some of the other professors, he likes to assign it on a very short deadline (I.E. finish the chapter on monday, homework is pushed up to be due that wednesday). Attendance was required as he gave in class clicker questions everyday that count as participation (but also are graded). Kinda sassy guy.", "This guy really knew what he was talking about. Great teacher and good guy to help you out.

The class is not easy, you HAVE to study. But he will give you everything you need in order to pass the test. He is really nice and funny. I highly recommend taking him for oceanography. GREAT PROFESSOR GREAT CLASS!", "Perkins is friendly, and will certainly help you understand the material - he actually wrote the course textbook, so the course is very consistent.

Helpful. Responds quickly to emails. Seems to like what he's doing (which is rare!)

We're there to learn, not to fail.", "Professor was very knowledgeable in the field. Does good reviews for tests. No attendance policy. Just print out slides and study. Pulls questions for the test out of slides. I would definately reccommend. Bad reviews below are for his 5000 level classes.", "He is very good. He likes to take the time to teach his students. He care's about how they do. If you don't understand something, he is willing to actually help you. Keeps class entertaining.", "Well, this guy is as dry as a piece of sandpaper. If you have ever seen the guy from the \"clear eyes\" commericials he reminds me of him. But, having said all that his class is not difficult, I made a B and didn't do to much. He lectures off powerpoint and the test comes direcetly off that. He also gives 2 10 min. breaks for the 3 hour class.", "Great guy. Brilliant, too. Easy to approach and good insight (a genuine care for students). Make sure you do the required readings - he'll want you to name names and events. It's more than just theory at this stage. Work hard and get a good mark - you'll be satisfied.", "easy, but then graded really hard on the papers to achieve bell curve", "One of the few actually good teachers at this university. He might take a little getting used to but he is very available and willing to help. He knows the stuff and is good at explaining. It's best not to talk in class unless asked. The field trips are good but the class has too many students.", "Hands down my favorite prof at King's! Snider is hilarious and he makes the material fun and interesting to learn. For once, I was actually looking forward to chem instead of dreading it.", "boring professor who gives out tricky exams, and his grading system is unfair. his definition of a curve is rounding 79.5 to 80.", "No Comments", "I took frank for A&P 1 and 2. He is a great teacher! Very helpful and understanding. This class isnt easy but if you show up and show effort you should pass. Make sure to go to his Test Review classes, they are very helpful!! Definately recommend this teacher over all the others. I recieved an A and A&P1 and B in A&P2.", "Prof Kojo is a really easy professor to take ANT101 with......as long as you write your papers according to his own opinions. If you differ with what he believes basically expect to get nothin better than a \"c\". Plus you don't learn much in his class. Mostly just reviewing the daily news and talking about random issues of the day. No test given.", "Mr. Razze is a funny little man he is a nice guy not much of a professor. He was directing when I graduated in 1999 and his productions are not really good. His class TR 222 is interesting and comes in handy when I play trivial pursuit however, none of this is practical. He is a really nice guy just not a good professor and even worse actor", "Incredible professor and human being. If you get a chance to take a class of his while at the College, do it! You won't regret it!", "hes nuts and crazy but GREAT! He is so smart!", "He is a great professor. He loves to sit down and meet with you one on one and is willing to help at any time.", "Hard class, but only if you don't study. Uses powerpoints and videos. Explains things well, tells some jokes in class. Likes to give quizes over material covered. Helpful professor. In this class, which is lab and lecture, he gives a break about halfway thru (2 hr class). Very challenging class, only cuz I'm taking 4 other classes.", "He is a little rude when he talk. he is not organized, it seems like he never prepare for class. he just comes in and talk from his experiences. after this finance class I still don't understand stock market. he only answers question but how do i ask question when i haven't learned anything. i guess the class is for whoever already know.", "Hadley is very mean, and a very unclear professor. Needs to work on his people skills, although he *should* have them figured out by now. Will NOT like you in class unless you're a DRAMA/THEATRE major, be forewarned.", "Entire class consists of him doing examples. He might briefly talk about the concept to introduce it. Homework is on LonCapa which is the worst! If you bring him the question, he'll do it for you though. Tests are alright if you review. He's a good person, but not the best teacher. Trig is hard, and he doesn't really make it easier. No book needed.", "The professor teaches in a boring approach. Its all powerpoints. He wants your work to be done EXACTLY how he does it. I like physics, but im not learning despite the hours spent studying. There are only 10 students left in class. He gives out a lot of handouts, which he revises constantly. I do not advice anyone to take him.", "He is a very well intentioned man and very smart, but he has a lot of trouble getting ideas across and there is minimal organization (if any) for the labs. Most of the lab is spent on tedious things and you come out frustrated.", "HORRIBLE professor, forgets what he is about to say. Extremely hard, expects you to remember every single detail. Do not take History 101 with him!", "Due to illness/family issues I was only able to show up to class once a week (for our exams every Friday) and yet I managed to pass with a 80%. Class was not difficult, but it was a hassle to receive our grades and marks. And even now that the semester is over, I still do not have a final mark/grade.", "Very great teacher. Hes goofy and out there which is different from the average teacher. He makes up funny sayings and tries his best to relate math with real world examples. I was never bored in his class. He picks on everyone so beware and pay attention at all times. I would definitely recommend him. I wish I could take him for Stats.", "Prior to this class i didn't even know what the adobe cloud was. I was nervous that because Jason taught the advanced emac class I would really struggle. But we went through each program from the ground up and our projects were left relatively open. Jason is really helpful and willing to make time out of class to help as well.", "Rob Burton, while a very interesting instructor who is at times thought-provoking to listen to, I will not take again. He has a very weird grading scale. Reading specific blogs, which are the primary source of our grades in this class (60%), are graded not with letter grades or percentages, but rather \"smiley-faces\". He is also quite sarcastic.", "Very nice guy, gave a whole sheet of paper front and back for use on test, gave 7 tests which was good and bad. The class made absolutely no sense but thats not the professors fault. Just use the peice of paper on the test and youll be fine maybe.", "Kowalka is an amazing professor...great guy...fun class!", "No Comments", "Challenging class but smart and funny teacher.

Took a 5 week summer course. There's about 300 problems due every week through the learnsmart program in a system called connect, plus 8 homework questions.

Now he is no longer teaching at TCC. :( He is an excellent teacher and a very nice person. Thank you, Mr. Smith!!!", "one thing to remember in his class is that its an easy A. all you have to do is write down whatever he writes, b/c what he writes is on the quiz. if one wants to make an easy C, just pay attention on the day of a quiz when he goes over the chapter. make sure people ask questions b4 test b/c more questions means more answers!!!!", "He knows what he is talking about. He is a very nice man. He didn't organize world politics very well though. It was always unclear what we were supposed to have read for class, and he assigned a ridiculous amout of reading. It was mostly redundant, and he did not elaborate on the subtleties between readings in class. Pointless readings.", "I learned A LOT in his classes. Gets u to work hard, that's good. He's very passionate about the subject,which can be good and bad in this case -good b/c u can learn as much as in a known film sch at the community coll level,but also bad if u get too invested.Remember that it's still a community coll crse for credit for a degree w/value. Balance.", "cool and funny guy; makes class enjoyable", "He is a great Prof. who knows what he is talking about. the class will fly by", "I had no previous programming knowledge before this class and I walked with a B. His lectures are funny and interesting. He dumbs it down so you can understand the concepts. GO TO THE SL SESSIONS! It's free tutoring and anything free is good. They help clarify the lectures and are hands on. Mike wants you to pass so you have support there.", "He made a methods class fun. That takes skill. But what is up with the loony comments he leaves on graded papers?", "Remains well versed in knowledge but has become burdened with fund raising, out-reach, and departmental issues which occupy a majority of his time instead of teaching.", "He is a really good teacher. I like the way he teaches, he makes you understand what's going on. I thoroughly enjoyed his class. Just study hard, do what you gotta do and you'll be fine. Don't be late or he'll make you sing in front of the class! All in all, the class was fun, he's pretty funny and cool once you know him better. Grading is alright.", "Not a bad prof. Movies are standard film studies stuff. Super easy exams. Everything is from the texbook. Essays are pretty fair. If you do the readings and watch the movies online you don't even have to come to class. I skipped the entire second semester and got an A.", "Prof Abert is definitely a prof I will never take again, nor will I recommend him to anyone. I ended up catching the flu and missed the first test and he never responded to any of my emails and when I returned and asked to make up the test he said no and walked away. The test I did take had 10 questions. Also, be prepared for nonstop homework...", "He may have high expectations for the boring intro classes compared to some other teachers, but hes actually a really interesting, funny, great guy if you get to know him in upper level clases.", "PHYSIO--You don't need the book for any of his classes. He posts study questions online and if you memorize them you will know at least half or more of the test. He curves every test. You don't have to attend class but every time you do and he passes a roll sheet around you get a 1/3 of a bonus point added to your final grade. And he is hilarious.", "I want to become this man. I've had a couple of classes with him, and he's simply amazing. In upper level courses, expect to write something every week, but don't let that scare you off, it's really not a strain.", "Nice guy, gives you study guides for exams, 7 map quizzes. If you actually study, you'll do well. Don't bother buying the book; never used it. Goes over exam study guides in class and usually gives you the answers so note taking is a must.

He gives a lot of examples during lecture, which helps your understanding a lot. Homework, quizzes, and exams are easy.", "Awesome course and I am very glad I took it. If you are decided on him and another teacher TAKE HIM. This is a perfect GE course for life science if you are not a science major.

It sounds like a lot but it really isn't!", "Dr. Terry is a horrible professor. He will tell you in a million words what could take 5 seconds on a board. His first test was 9 chapters long.

He'll keep you interested even if you're not excited about environmental stuff!", "such a funny guy, love him. he is a genius and is a bit confusing when he talks about the subject matter. he is really into what he teaches. as long as you try hard in the class you will do well even if you do bad on exams. show effort that you care about the class and meet with him though if you dont understand.", "He is definitely monotonous but his notes and drawings are usually what are on the tests so they aren't bad. He isn't very extroverted but amiable. There won't be problems understanding but beware his multiple choice test where the choice of \"two or more of the above are true\", highly recommended.", "this class is is supper hard, i would not reccommend it unless it is required.", "Didn't even understand what his lectures were about.

Steer clear of James Naus for a TA in Madden's class he is a horrible grader and will make Madden's teaching totally worthless.", "Yeah, I actually talked to another IT101 teacher and found out he's teaching stuff that isn't necessarily needed for the course. He's awful. Says that if you study you'll do well but he words questions on quizzes to confuse you. It's hard to do well in this class. Take Whitcomb or someone else, because Englander is not helpful.", "He's the freakin' man... and he's gorgeous.", "Mr. Gutliph is a great professor that wants all of his students to succeed. This is not an easy class by any means, but it's doable. There are two homework assignments & a quiz every week, but he gives you the entire semester to turn them in. DO THEM WEEKLY! Don't fall behind!

Grading is subjective anyways, but he takes it to a new level. Personally, I didn't like him too much. The material was pretty interesting on the other hand. My TA this year was incredible though!", "Amazing class, has an in depth understanding of the subjects, and is a pioneer in the field of ray tracing and realistic image synthesis. Thew classes flow very smooth, very comprehensible.

He tries to joke with the class 2 add humor. Likes ppl 2 participate. NE problems ask & he will help. Do reviews homework & take notes ull b fine. Easy way to make an A. Qt in a hat oh ask him to wear a skirt lol LB is the best!", "He is a nice man but his lectures are long and confusing. You have to read the textbook otherwise you won't really know what is happening. Make sure to study really hard. He doesn't really like for you to ask questions, but as long as you study and try to pay attention you should be fine.", "one of the nicest persons i've ever had the privilege of meeting! readings for class were somewhat hard but we went slow and he helped a lot. too much translating though. very helpful prof and very understanding! not a lot of homework - just reading and one major paper and presentation. some parts of tests were a bit hard though.", "Every Northwest student should find a way to take a class with him at least once.", "Amazing teacher. He really helped me get better at writing and was cool when I asked for an extension.

Professor is very nice and knows a lot. TA also teaches very well and is very cute", "He is a huge nerd but very funny and entertaining. There is a lot of reading!!! It is a socratic class so you don't need to talk and therefore do not need to do the reading all of the time. However, if you don't do the reading it will bite you in the ass when it comes to the final. He is an easy grader if you do what he says. I recommend him!", "His method of grading is different but effective. He is informative, and gets off topic easily which is partially good. If you do the work you are good for the semester.", "He doesn't know how to teach, and on midterms, he asked questions that he did not cover/lecture. AWFUL professor", "He makes you do the work, but he makes the class alot of fun.", "Hot!", "dudeeeeeeeeeeee u rock... no surprises in the exam... just practice back of the book question.. extremely helpfulll", "His assignments were all discussion posts, which don't have many parameters. He assigns a book that is a great read, it hardly feels like work. If you do the work then you will get the grade. Be sure to request for your article that is due at the end of the class. You will know what I am talking about, but be sure to request for them in advance.", "This professor is very unprofessional. He responds to every question as if the student is questioning his intelligence. Enjoys talking down to students. Uses the term \"creativity\" as a grading parameter to take points away for no apparent reason. He also likes to use double negative statements on exams to purposefully confuse students.", "Beneski is very monotone and the lectures are dry. You need to go to class and take good notes because he goes into much more detail just off the top of his head. In order to get a good grade you have to be able to apply the material in the test. Start to prepare for the test 2 weeks in advance. Its doable.", "How to describe this prof? He is always late for class there is no tutorial because he uses it to teach, needs help from student when he makes mistakes, tests were rediculously long and the class was never prepared, should not be teaching", "Professor Scherb wants you to pass but tests are extremely difficult.

I studied each chapter and review sheets I made three times each, took off from work to study and still had difficulty.", "Avoid taking this with 301, you will fail.

I spent quite a bit of time talking to him outside of class and found him more than helpful and personable. If you want a good grade, do what it takes.", "One of the wisest professors I have had at Fordham. Class is lecture style but very engaging with presentations.

He is a fair guy and gives you lots of opportunities to do well in the course. He tosses free bonus marks. Go to dgd's there are quizzes that can result in bonus marks. For 1321 (or 1331) he provides you with all of his course notes which has everything you need for the course. FInd old exams!!!!!!!!!", "All he does in class is go over what will be on the test. We get really long reviews, which end up being only half the test. It's just confusing. But if you study the reviews, you will do fine because he gives curves.", "Dr. Nelson makes a rather boring class (I'm not interested in Botany) enjoyable and entertaining. It takes some getting used to, but don't drop in the first week. Be prepared to study every week for lecture and field quizzes, which seems like a lot, but it's do-able. Put in the effort and Dr. Nelson will see that and reflect it in your grade.", "One of the sweetest people I've ever met! Know his stuff, fun and enthusiastic. Great teacher!", "He's not very helpful. I've had him twice, and both times he hasn't helped when I've asked. He thinks he knows everything, but he misses a lot. Doesn't really stick to the syllabus as far as a daily break down in what is going on in the class.", "if you don't take this professor during your time at EKU, you will never forgive yourself. If every professor were like him, id never want to graduate. He is absolutely incredible. He cares about the students, he is insanely smart and outgoing, and wants to see you succeed. Please, if you get the chance, take class with him. you won't regret it", "I am taking the final for this class tomorrow but overall a good class. The lectures are long but it really clarifies the concepts. At first he was very repetitive but with more material it was very helpful. His examples are funny, and if you don't think he's funny at all then you probably have boring classmates. You have to work but it's worth it.", "Dr. Panter is great! Very smart, super nice. Tough class, but it's worth it because he's an awesome prof!", "He's a good prof.U don't have to go to class, but just read thru the books for all quizes, and do the online practice.Lectures are very helpful for exams if you take notes.He doesn't care about the attendence. No homework for his class,only one optional term paper.He's a fair grader,only base on exa", "There are few teachers that trully make a difference in students' lives; Prof. Lank is one of them.

His course is interesting, provides great notes, and great guest sp", "Fun teacher, tries to make class lively with jokes, accents, he's weird but enjoyable. The course reader he makes you buy sucks cuz you only use 2 pages, but its mandatory. He's in the entertainment business so the critical reviews are based in that area, watch a movie/ play/ visit museum, write a review, EASY. Tells you exactly whats on the tests", "Enthusiastic about the material, and a fairly nice guy, but the tests are much tougher than the class suggests, and the in-class notes don't help much. The notes are basically nothing but graphs, and he'll just breeze through the details you need to know. You'll need to read the book to do well.", "I had professor Inch for several classes in the late 90's. I enjoyed his sense of humor and learned a lot from him. Ed was also my advisor and believed in me at a time when I was young and struggling.", "none", "He rambles and his reviews have little to do with his test. If you keep up it is all pretty fair", "Awesome teacher... never had any problems... Highly recommend.", "very self impressed. Discourages independent thinking in his students. Just write what you believe he will want you to write and you will do just fine. Unfortunately, that isn't the way to foster a real voice among students now is it?", "It is mandatory to take religion at Bryn Athyn and I did so without the best attitude. However Thane and The New Church's approach to religion is thoughtful and inspiring. It is quite evident that Thane really cares about the material he is teaching and the students.

Am not a fan of him or his teaching methods.", "I thought he was a very helpful teacher, actually teaches and writes notes in class unlike Westmoreland who expects you to learn it all on your own.

Everything is in essay format, reading were very interesting. Loved it, would take more classes with him.", "Do I really need to say anything? Just look at the other comments. Great guy.", "Professor Talham is the best! He's a cool guy who knows how to make Chemistry interesting, and a hard class accessible to students.

I went from 70s to an 98 and a comment on how much he liked my paper.", "Prof. Kurylo is not the typical college professor that just want you to memorize a bunch of stuff and then feed it back on a paper. He really expect you to think. On his test, it is more benefit for you to understand why rather than just study like a robot.", "Abramov was great! He was easy to understand, his lectures were easy to keep up with, and he's hilarious. Read the chapter before class and you'll do great. Only 3 tests, no midterm, and they are multiple choice, 50 questions. Taking the final on Monday, fairly confident.

Show up and pay attention, and you should get at least a C or better.", "I have had him for two courses and they were both a pleasure. I can't understand some of these other comments.

If you needed anything he was always there.", "No Comments", "Easy A! his lecture could be boring at times and he could be really funny.

Anyways, this guy is a great prof.", "He is a great teacher, gives constructive criticism all the time. He uses a lot of repetition, which got pretty boring to me after half of the semester.

His temper gets in the way of his teaching. I learned a lot from Craig, but the most important thing I learned was how not to treat people.", "It was a good Excel class. I entered without knowing how to use Excel and this class helped a lot. You can complete your assignment at home and print a screenshot of a part of your work to turn in the next class. Attendance is taken every class. I learned a lot overall and I enjoyed this class!", "Great teacher, he is very helpful, lecture material is clear and understandable. Tests are mainly based on notes.

He is indeed the greatest", "Dr. Hardy was a great professor. I've read many negative reviews about him but those must have been the students who were expecting hand outs and did not show for class.

Intelligent, passionate, hilarious, and truly wants his students to do well--and he will teach you how to write. Not an easy grader, but lenient with due dates and always willing to work with you. If at all possible, TAKE HIM!!!", "yes, a little unclear, but is always willing to help", "I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Evergates. While gentle of voice and speech, he packs a punch! Very entertaining, very informative. Loved the narrative style of his lecturing! Speaking as a non-traditional student, I think he is one of the most respectful and decent professors on campus.", "If you are a beginner, STAY AWAY. Mean, demeaning, and impossibly hard. Take his class only if torture is your style.", "Mr. Salvo is the best! He's a real down to earth person that really cares about his students. If you need advice or help with anything, he will take time out of his day to help you. What a great teacher!", "Can earn an A if you do the work. There is a decent amount to do, but it's not too difficult. Very thorough comments in assignments. Fast turnaround when grading.", "I have had several courses with this professor and I think he is excellent. He is very demanding, has a lot of reading, but the tests are open book, so if you are paying attention in class and do your work, you will do very well. I like his lecturing style. He uses groups in his classes, but you can do the papers on your own if you want.", "Great class, easy, but you do learn a lot both from the text and instructors experiences. Great guy and easy going but can put you to sleep sometimes......especially after a lunch at Speeds Deli....MMMMMmmmm Speeeeds...", "fair on grading but tests and exams are not from the lectures........heavy on the textbook...... good lectures tho....", "I took my first class with him the summer before my freshman year. It was in 1972, and my first college course, and I loved him! I took another course later with him, and loved him also then. It has been many years, but his teaching still impacts my life. He was one of the reasons why I eventually changed my major to Sociology.", "Very difficult, but very dedicated teacher.", "Best teacher I have ever had. Scary at first but then you get used to him and he's great. Understanding if you go and talk to him as well, but isn't a pushover. I recommend his class, as it's the only class that i've ever found interesting enough to go to", "His accent is pretty nice. Good teacher, easy class", "the worst advisor you will ever find.Supposedly he's the chair of the Pre-Med department but doesnt know anything.He told me to take botany and zoology at the same time with 4 other subjects and wanted me to take stats, all at the same time! Crazy person!", "I got an A in College Algebra and when I got to his Calculus class, I had to drop out because he was so hard and I have always been a good math student. He isn't helpful when we make suggestions, and if your phone rings he snaps and gives a HARD pop quiz!", "Excellent teacher. Difficult subject but he is genuinely interested in seeing students succeed. Taken both CalcIII and Diff Eq. with him. Curves tests and usually offers some form of extra credit.", "Paul is weird but funny. His notes are everything-GO TO CLASS. Definitely do the homework & get an answer key as well as the review sessions (he basically gives you answers to the test). He is definitely a tough grader, but gives you everything you need to be successful. Also gives up to 5 extra credit points for hmk & participation.", "I love JC. It's obvious that he loves what he does and is always really excited about it. I know sometimes it seems that he wants to implement his ideas on the students, but he really does know what he's talking about. He really wants his students to do well and he's always there fore support and guidance. I find him hilarious... he does too.", "Hands down not only the coolest prof/teacher I have ever had, but probably the coolest (and yes, nerdiest) guy i know outside of my own age group.

Classes can be a bit heavy on the reading, but if you have a chance to take one of them dont pass it by!", "Excellent professor, very helpful, but very hard grader.", "Dr. Midkiff is a phenomenal teacher and a really nice person. Considering how difficult thermodynamics is, he makes it very understandable. He includes tons of practical application examples in his lectures that make them engaging. Great sense of humor too. I highly suggest him for any thermo course at this school.", "scanlin is the man it doesnt get cooler than him", "To say that this man is one of the best profs on this campus only begins to describe the incredibly positive impact he has had on the lives of so many of his students.", "Extraordinarily smart, and knows his material. He's the department chair and rightfully so.", "Chem 103 was a little tough. His notes are sporadic and random. He goes out of the book so don't depend on your notes. He isn't very clear about most things but he does love what he does! The tests ask a lot of random minor things you barely cover so know everything. He has a major grading curve so that is nice but the tests are pretty tricky.", "Hugh is hillarious but can be offensive if you are a softy. He is an easy grader and has a healthy sense of self (not modest):)", "I'm horrible at math. I had to take all of the development classes and barely passed those. Professor Young is the best math teacher I have ever had. Yes, I made an effort to learn the material but he really breaks down everything and never makes you feel stupid for not knowing/remembering a concept. TAKE HIM IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH ANY TYPE OF MATH", "Taking this class for non science majors is a joke. I failed the first test though I got A's on all the labs. He gives a lot of extra credit but it's not enough when the tests are impossible and worth most of your grade. It was a mistake to take this class as a GSC requirement.Don't take this class!", "No Comments", "OMG, this class is HARD! The professor reads literally each work from the lecture notes and adds some other details to the notes, but overall, he JUST READS from them. The sample tests are really helpful in understanding how to translate the formulas into practice and after doing the first exam, it gets easier. Very nice person but boring class.", "I went twice and got an A. As long as you do the HW you will be fine and the math is a joke. However, the two times that I did go, I wanted to jump out the window, he is awful. He mumbles, speaks awful english and gets frustrated after the second question. But take the class for the easy MATH/DEC credit, trust me.", "Fantastic director", "No Comments", "I really liked Dr. E. I had him for two classes and found him to be helpful if you take the time to ask questions. Seems intimidating until you meet with him. He does give difficult tests though.", "He is a horrible teacher. Doesn't give good lectures. Rambles on and on. I would never have him as a professor again.", "Extremely helpful. He expects a lot and digresses a lot, but I learned so much from him. Take his classes if you can.", "Man this guy is BORING...his classes are simple. Very judgemental if your not a biology major. THinks your a waste of space unless you have a major.", "Sometimes, class duration was too long and unnecessary. Allowed late submissions for assignments. Slow or no response to email. Otherwise, he was patient and straightforward. Assignments were vague and students would submit their own interpretation instead of using a template for consistency.", "Run away!", "Professor Ibrahim is extremly nice and is understanding. He drops the lowest grade and funny. I would definatly take one of his other classes again. BEST professor ever!! If I were you I'd fight tooth and nail to get into his class. :)", "No Comments", "Worse professor I ever had. He is not willing to help students out and is random in class.

He's very flexible and the assignment are very easy. Take this course to get a pretty easy A.", "The rest of the comments are spot on. One of the best professors UCI has to offer. Gently explains complex topics, provides beautiful proofs, and encourages good note-taking by providing clear explanations on the whiteboard. Always well prepared and very helpful during office hours. Take this course if you get a chance, you won't regret it.", "Charismatic man, do all of your work (essays and academic marks) and you will pass the class. You will not dread going to this class rather you will be excited to go.", "No Comments", "Simply amazing.I would love to have a professor like him again!!! If you get him, you're truly lucky. :)", "Dr. Alexakos will expect you to write a PHD level paper in his class.

DO NOT i repeat DO NOT choose this teacher! DON NOT!", "hes cooler than a fan...a little strange but thats what makes the class fun...gotta keep up on your work or it'll screw you later...lots of essays but he gives you a long time to finish...1 take home test to help you out...because of his style of teaching the whole class ends up pretty close...hes o", "Excellent professor! If you're not serious about the class then you will not do too well, but as long as you follow his instructions, don't miss more than 3 classes, and pay attention, you'll be fine. If you have any problems with any moves, he'll help you out until you get it.", "HE IS REALLY NICE AND EASY! TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN!", "By far the best teacher, and course that I have ever taken in my life. This class is a lto fo hard work but you enjoy it. There is a lot of reading but most of the class time is spent on discussions.

Encourages students to engage in thoughtful discussion and incredibly positive! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "He is so DULL and he has several very distracting little ticks. I really like history but he was just too much. I highly discourage anyone from taking any of his classes!", "Don't ever choose this professor for any course. I took him for a Hunger class and he absolutely hated me for no reason. He's very rude and arrogant. He gave me a C in the class when I calculated my grade to be a B+. This man is corrupt and bases grades on how well he likes you.", "i dont think he \"needs to be fired\"... liked him as a prof and learned a lot", "His lectures are awful! He'll go on these long rants about random things, and half the time you won't know what he is even talking about. His tests are HEAVY on material, very tough to study for. The one thing I did like about the class is the analysis paper we wrote.", "Take him for PS. He says F word a lot, but everyone likes it. His lectures are inspirational, you'll never get bored listen to him. He assumes that students know everything about the US government, and he expects you to know a lot! I didn't know a thing, so ended up dropping the class. But definitely come back for those great lectures when im ready", "Easiest math class i've ever had in life", "This dude is incredibly well-spoken and humble. He never talks down to his students and always respects their views. He makes the class a very chill experience, and as long as you do the inquisitives, you will definitely pass. In terms of the tests, he lets you use an index card and I'd recommend just writing timeline, so you can nail chronology.", "interesting class, but uses a powerpoint. very nice teacher, easy grader, very easy tests. and two also easy papers to write. take it!", "He is a good teacher, class is not dat hard. Test are exactly from the exercises and not hard.HE does exercies on the bord, so it is easy.", "Awesome teacher I loved his class. I would love to take his class again.", "A really nice guy and a good counselor. Hes very helpful and knows his stuf well.", "No Comments", "Moliassa is a hilarious & makes math fun! He often came to class with chalk all over his face & always said good morning even though it was evening. He was very helpful and clarified a lot of topics for me.

He is very rude and doesn't care about the students.", "No Comments", "Hadley could be harsh, but you just have to take it in stride. He's an old man who knows by now that not everyone is going to like him, so he doesn't try to be the favorite professor. You don't have to be a drama major to make him like you; you just have t", "Ridiculous amount of work assigned. At the time, work assigned had nothing to do with Philosophy. Looking back I can see how he tried to connect it, but failed. Tries to be a good teacher, but he just doesn't explain things well. I suggest you don't take this class.", "Great class! It was easy but I learned a ton!", "I had Dr. Evergates for \"Senior Seminar\". Simply put this man is excellent. He is so knowledgeable in his field and others, is always willing to help, and took our papers and made them into something amazing. He is one of the best the college has.", "Professor Pletcher provided me with two classes during my time at Denison University as an exchange student.

His classes were inspiring and insightful and instrumental for me in determing my academic path. Pletcher comes highly recommded", "Amazing teacher. Really liked him. Brilliant artistically. Highly recommended him. A treasure.", "Kind of a weird class. I had him for psychology 101 and the lectures were super long at first and not much for the test was covered in class, but towards the end you realize you don't have to show up to class except on test days and his stories and life lessons are actually really good and funny. He's a good guy. Easy A!", "I loved this class. The class topics provoked a lot of thought and discussion. I learned a lot about my writing and how I can combine writing with my photography and other multimedia work I do in my other TCS classes. Dr. Andy assigned interesting readings. Some of the writing assignments were hard. Definitely a lot of work. Definitely worth it.", "(Sorry but I don't know off-hand what the course number is!). The guy is full of himself. It's easy to do well in his class since the only thing that he really cares about is if you can give his own words and thoughts back to him. Comes off as a nice guy, but his ego is taller than he is.", "Professor Fox is a nice man, but his lectures can be boring.", "Rob Burton has his flaws, but he'll grow on you. His class is great - he always assigns great texts, leads interesting discussions, and the use of informal blogs for homework is fun and engaging. He can be irritable from time to time but I wouldn't take it personally. He's not such a cold fish one-on-one as he seems in class. Recommended.", "A maniac who digs insects! A blast to work with! Bring on more Rolling Rock!", "Ehh", "He was an ok professor. You have to do the reading for the quizzes, and you have to be a good writer for the exams, but if you pay attention and do the reading it isn't really all that hard. I got a B+. He does like to hear himself talk though...", "Amazing teacher, I believe his goal is to open your eyes and teach you how to want to learn, rather than making you know unimportant dates and names, but rather the reason behind things. Be at class, listen, participate, and enjoy.", "I love this teacher. I took three semesters with him, if I have any math class I will take with him with pleasure :)", "Old guy who reminds me of my grandfather and tells really corny jokes. the whole class sleeps but a really easy class if youre into reading out of the text book. Quizzes on each chapter once a week...T or F. and he lets you make up tests if youre not there, easy A", "I think he's a first time instructor, but he's really nice and tries hard to make us understand.

He's honestly the worst person I've ever met.", "Aaron Kozbelt knows his subject and he knows how to explain concepts. He is organized. His presentations are clear. Would have liked to have him for other courses. Some professors at brooklyn college should be watching him teach so they can brush up on their lecture skills.", "Hard to understand his lecture...Exam are from book and his lecture speech...But you need to attend everyday and writes down everything to know what is on his exam. His lecture sometime confused you.", "With a habit of cutting to the quick, he does expect abit much from the beginners, but once you give him time and work with him one on one his methods become a bit clearer and his advice becomes much more sound. A special study course with him would be the best bet for truly gaining from his teachings.", "Excellent", "Great teacher. Alot of experience in the industry and it shows in his teaching methods. Anytime you need help he is willing to give you his time.", "He will give you a zero for even the smallest of errors. Does not answer questions or help, just tells you to read the book. His grading system is completely outrageous, and the class is more about following his ever growing set of rules than learning to code. Not at all what I expected from an introductory coding class.", "Loved it, made tedious details in course very interesting and applicable, good professor; humorous", "The best professor I have had at EMU. He is so passionate and this class is so relevant to the education department. He loves discussion, and is completely interested in his students'. There is a ton of reading, but he has perfected this course so that all readings are appropriate. Loved this professor!", "John Burk is a great professor! I failed Business Calc the first time but after taking him I actually started understanding. He gives a good bit of homework but it all helps for the exams that he gives.", "He is the worst teacher. I did not learn a single thing in this class. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! Sonoma should fire him.", "One of the best instructors in the MIS department.Have to study a lot but if you pay attention in class you will surely get an A.", "I would highly recommend Mr. Gutliph.

He is a great professor, and actually cares that you pass his class.", "No Comments", "Never slept better in my life!", "Best teacher in the Department", "He tends to rush his lectures, and it can be pretty hard keeping up. His style is rather theatrical, but he reads off his paper in front of him which sort of detracts from it. I LOVED him the one time he covered for our TA. Laid back and with no notes, he joked around, answered questions, and imparted lots of info. His lectures should be like that.", "Attendance is mandatory. I missed a couple of his classes which resulted in my missing his pop quizzes. Doesn't let you retake them. Assigns 1 essay. Readings are important. Makes tricky quizzes. He's a nice guy, but I wouldn't take a class from him again.", "Best prof I have ever had. Hands down.", "I agree...he's nice but I'm constantly lost.", "He is open to hearing any point of view, but if there is what he feels is a right one he will push you towards it. He has a story or the like to go with every topic, which is good and makes it easier to learn. And is not homophobic or pushes christiany.", "I took Scripps for Comp Sci 162. He certainly knew what he was doing when it came to programming and he usually was able to get the information across. No real tests during the class other than midterm and final.

Would take him again though.", "Excellent professor.I learned a great deal in his class.I took him for one class but I still go to him all the time to ask questions.He has a passion for teaching and will go out of his way to help students who really try.Good professor to take if ur taking MCAT.Doesnt spoonfeed students.His class was rather challenging because he made me THINK.", "No Comments", "He's amusing, but I find it very difficult to feel engaged in the classroom. He also does not take the time to learn ANYONE'S names.", "One word: BORING. That describes both him AND the class. His lectures are the most boring thing I have ever experienced in my life. I stopped going after the first few. I recommend it if you like classes that are mostly online, though.", "Dennis has incredible knowledge about his subject and makes the classes laugh-out-loud entertaining and memorable. He also holds his students to a very high standard but is always approachable and helpful. He has remained a dear friend to this day, long after I graduated from Whitman.", "very easy, explains things well, easy class", "His lectures were pretty pointless in my opinion...I only attended class on the days we had class. He sends you an e-mail of all the readings that will be on the quizzes. The only thing was, there was so many articles to read and he really wanted you to know the dates of things. but he's funny and approachable during class! Would recommend!!", "Avdulov is the BEST! If you're ready for the challenge of learning a new language, take him! His teaching style is awesome, and he's SUPER helpful. If you really try hard and he sees that, he'll love you. If you do bad on a test, he'll let you retake it. It'll be basically the exact same so you can ace it. Definitely the best prof for Japanese!", "One of the more enlightened experiences I've had in the classroom. My writing improved to the point where I did extremely well on my GMAT ( 6 ), and I attribute that to Dr. Terry and my social sciences instructors. I want to emphasize that writing matters in all subjects, and Terry explains clearly regarding his standards and how to meet them.", "Worst CIS teacher ever... Seriously he needs to retire or something. He seems like a pretty decent guy but what he teaches is completely irrelevant to what he gives out in his exams.

I would strongly reccommend him!", "The class does not prepare students to be a Children's Librarian, instead it is full of continuous book and multimedia evaluations. Student's will learn more working with a Children's Librarian than taking this class. This class is not taught but rather constructed from a text book.", "First, Con Law is a terrible subject. That being said, he isn't the greatest prof either. His teaching style leaves a lot to be desired, but he's a real nice guy, he lets you know what he expects, and he's fair just like his name says.", "Great teacher! Helps get one into the understanding of accounting easily. In order to succeed, you must do the homework although it is not mandatory.", "i don't care what all these people say, he may be hard, but i liked him, he's funny in a geeky way. you just have to work hard, get on his good side, and your in like flint.", "Very good teacher! Its impossible to get anything lower than a B if you actually put forth effort. Alot of papers and group work, but by far the best teacher to choose for this senior level class!", "For an old man, he is fairly good looking.", "Weird, weird guy. The class was presented so dryly. The class was nothing more than okay. Optional homework. No quizzes. Just the exams that come with study guides that contain I would say about 90%+ of the material that will be on exam. He explains things well, but has weird rules like no use of laptops in class.", "ALthough he is always late for class, overall he's a pretty good prof.

His tests can be somewhat tricky, so I recommend reading the book thoroughly if you want to do good on his exams", "Stuey is the man!

Relatively easy grader.", "Sadkowski is the worst professor I've had at UNI. Sadkowski lacks organization, shows up late to class daily, is regularly not prepared, and fails to make this course interesting. He relies on the textbook to cover all of his material.

He makes jokes and isn't too intimidating.", "Nice person, not a nice professor.", "No Comments", "He is a great teacher. He tells you how it is(meaning if your work is crap he will let you know), if you can't handle it you're in the wrong major. Camilo is funny. Great helper. Take notes and you are fine. He is very inspirational. He does have a accent but you can understand him. DO NOT SHOW UP LATE TO HIS CLASS! Do not miss any days either.", "He is good professor. His assignments are not easy, but these are very helpful for your future. if you need to take eng300, I recommend him.", "Lovely! Simply best ever prof. highly recommended!", "If you do not pay attention you will not pass the class. He is an extremely tough grader, that being said you only get graded on 5 separate things. 2 midterms, 2 paper and a final. If you pay attention and do the reading you will be fine for the most part, but showing up to class is a must or you will fall too behind and not do well. good luck.", "This class is really easy as long as you follow the book and practice the exam before you take it. Before you buy the book make sure your getting the current one and the right class book. I accidentally bought the book for IDES 250!", "He tells jokes yes, and tells stories not connected with an educational experience, and kaboom classtime is over with. I believe this is his goal (filler) to accomplish another class. Where is the meat? Where is an education dept. at Immac?", "He is a great teacher. His teaching style if very different and he makes his classes very interesting. There is never a dull moment in the class. I thought the class was very helpful too.", "Iv taken two online classes with Thom, and have nothing but success in both of these classes! He is very understanding and flexibility on late work. Although I was in condensed classes over the summer, I didn't feel rushed.", "wow he so hard!! and makes you feel stupid if you don't have to take him don't!!!!", "Avoid him if you can", "Dr. Snider was an awesome professor. I had him for my Freshman year first semester of Chem 113. Dr. Snider has meaningful lectures and describes the material very well. In regards to asking questions, anything you don't get he will make sure you understand what he is talking about by the end of the class. His office hours are open and helpful.", "BEST professor in the world. I have been incredibly fortunate to have learned accounting from him. He is so intelligent. Go to him if you have questions about the material. Show that you care to work hard and succeed... do those things and you will gain his respect.. which is critical.", "I cannot say enough about what a wonderful teacher Dr. T is! He's incredibly nice, very helpful, & he makes what could've been a very dry subject a fascinating one. I always looked forward to his class & will jump at the chance to have him as a teacher again. The class is not hard & there really isn't that much work to do. Fun class, fun teacher!", "AWESOME!!! I love Coach so much!! I you dont like to sing after this class you will love it. He's so wonderful!", "Talk, talk, talk. But chili pepers and eye candy.", "If you want to learn something about literature and, even more, about writing solid, cohesive papers that you can be proud of, YOU CAN TAKE NO ONE BETTER. One of the BEST instructors I've ever had. Casual & funny in the classroom, tough as hell grading papers, but hey, you're in college; you should be writing decent papers by now to begin with.", "He is a very creative professor, loved his lectures. There is a lot of reading, but all the novels are completely worth reading! Highly suggest him!", "A big heart under his rough exterior, made what should have been a boring class entertaining and worthwhile. He does like to pick on students but it is all in good fun and he rewards students that pout in effort. Don't let his gruff hunter persona fool you either, he is one of the most intelligent people in the faculty.", "very funny :)", "Good guy. Respects your opinion. Semi-hard to get an A but just take your B and move on.", "No Comments", "Yes, John is a FUN teacher, and he's a great guy to talk to. However, attendance is a huge issue--not his, the class. He doesn't hold his students accountable for attendance in his upper level classes, so a lot of times class is pointless. You could attend every day and get the same grade as a person who came the first and last day.", "Great Professor. It's not the easiest class, but if your willing to put in the effort you'll do well.", "real hard to understand his english. writes real small and light. reading the book was more helpful. points people out for questions and if you happen to come late to class. won't take him.", "great teacher hot hot hot slackers need not apply", "Narrow students can't stand his defense of trad'l family amid a torrent of moral relativism. They're the mainstream sheep; he's protecting the harder ground. Arrogant? Rather delightfully vulnerable.", "Extremely difficult, but doable. Be prepared to study at least a couple of hours everyother night to stay on top of the subject. Between lecture and lab, you'll do about 12 hours of work a week just in bio. Do this and you MIGHT be ok. Take bio only if you are seriously into it.", "Tim is a very hands on professor and loves it when you ask him questions on scientific ideas or topics in the world. I had him for my FLC and I would take any class as him as the professor! The only thing is you have to read to books he assigns and watch the movies too!", "very nice guy, but also very awkward. seems almost too smart for his own good. for being big on public speaking and whatnot he's not too good with the whole social skills stuff himself. not too hard though, and can be fairly interesting at time.", "The online course was very time consuming. Watch movies, read his book and write a paper each week. The material is interesting. I feel like I did learn quite a bit, but would have learned more in a classroom setting. Syllabus is clear, you know what is expected from the start.", "The class is super easy. Go to lecture and do the homework and you'll be set. He bumps everyone up a huge amount at the end of the year.", "His tests are hard. He will make fun of you. He will ramble about off topic subjects. I learned the most from the other students.", "He tells the same stories over and over again. he reads right from the textbook and points at the board with a lazer pointer. He can barely walk and makes his tests hard, he expects 70% to fail.... Worst prof ever", "Walker is the way to go for econ. Clear explanations, and his tests are much more straightforward than Self or Olsen, who love to throw in trick questions. I had econ prior to taking this class, and thought he made it pretty interesting. Go to CL, do the workbook questions, and you'll do well.", "Tests cover a lot of information. Take really good notes.", "He is very kind--one of the best professors I have had so far at Tech!", "He's charming, witty, cultured, and charismatic. I would date him, but this is not a dating site. Do the weekly assignments and study concepts he tells you are going to be part of the essay questions and study guides, and you will do well in his class.", "This is the worst teacher i have ever had. he does not explain anything, and he does not even care about the stuff he teaches himself. try to avoid him, but if you must take him, expect to be bored out of your ever liveing mind.", "Intro. Physics teacher.Did not like this class at all. He was a nice guy and he obviously knew the material but could not teach it to students. He assumed you would just \"get it\" after a practically no explanation. Try to avoid.", "Absolutely find no worthiness. This old gentleman try to tell you what is patent and shareholder agreement, which you'd better Google cheaper, better and faster. Do not expect any practical thing from his class. He is apparently enjoys hisself in class.", "He is very specific of what he wants but doesn't tell you anything. He grades with a letter/lower letter grade and decides your grade based on how he feels at the time. He has no legit way of grading.", "Haynie is easier than most of my high school teachers. A nice man, but not in any way challenging or worthy of collegiate teaching.", "Cool teacher. He helped me a lot and made me feel like I was wanted there :). I am an international student and Dave really helped me not feel weird. He always explained things to me and to the other students and had a huge smile on his face. Great instructor!", "funny teacher... not very clear on what you have to do in class though... i would take him again.", "As someone who is downright scared of public speaking, I found his class to be very welcoming and helpful. I learned tons of pointers and figured out how to make my speeches concise and effective. Professor Betts made my four week Summer speech course bearable by being a helpful, friendly guy. He is to-the-point but not harsh. Great guy.", "Although the subject matter was extremely difficult, this guy makes it clear and fun to learn. Very helpful and always willing to sit down with you and thoroughly answer all questions. Gives you note packets too, so you don't have to write!", "Makes an impossibly difficult subject at least mildly comprehensible. Moves very fast, so be careful. Assigns more reading than necessary, but lectures very clearly. A nice guy -- doesn't grill you in class. The class would be great if we didn't have to move so fast. Should really be a 5-credit class.", "This is my 2nd time taking an online class with Mr. King. Every week you read a chapter, look up information online, and take a quiz. There is also a final paper. It's very easy if you do the work, because the quiz questions match the worksheet you complete. The final is taken from the quizzes, so save all your quiz answers in Word and search.", "Nothing but praise for this professor. Very articulate & tells interesting stories that relate to class materials. Straight forward & he reviews before the midterm and final. Quizzes & tests are extremely easy as long as you read & pay attention (grades on curve). Take his class, you won't regret it & learn lessons that'll stick with you.", "One of the best professors I've had at UCSD. He is thoughtful and intriguing, although I think what he says goes straight over the heads of most, which is the fault of the closed minded student populace, not him.", "this guy is can take a simple concept and make it confusing. terrible prof.", "Loved taking this class online with this professor! Easy but you have to read to understand the basic concepts.", "My favorite professor at Highline! He cares more about the students actually getting and understanding the information. He gives feedback on all returned papers, and he always has them graded within two days. Really cares about his students.", "I had Smith for freshmen composition. He was a decent teacher, but one thing I noticed was he didnt really care about the writing aspect of your paper. As long as the grammar was near perfect you got an A. Also the quizzes he gives are stupid and basically re worded from the last quiz. Good thing they only make up 10%. Also dont miss class.", "Almost 40 years later, I remember Peter Bloom for inspiring me to become a scholar. Peter taught me the joy of reading critically, writing well, and thinking logically. He changed my life, and I am grateful.", "High workload. However, homework assigned directly connects to quiz/exam content. If you have a really good case on a bad question he will listen. Like his 322 class the exam questions comes from the textbook publisher and therefore is very picky. You have to read because you get quizzed on reading before you are taught.", "I really admire his passion about music, and his interest in the students. He's a truly amazing and good-hearted person. The top of his profession. Bravo Dr. D!", "I took Peter Conti for both ENG111 and 151. This is a hybrid class, you only meet in class about 6 times for the whole semester. He is a tough grader and expects a lot from his students. He takes no excuses and if you don't do your work don't expect to pass. but he is a great professor overall I really did learn a lot from him.", "Good teacher, nice guy once you get to know him. Needs to work on the whole keeping promises to students thing though.", "Weber is a freaking amazing teacher did his Layers of Rome Trip, thought it was going to be a party. You go over there to learn! I learned more in one month with him than any other professor. He's a tough grader, expects a lot from you and is truly one hell of a teacher. If you want to learn, take this class if you want an easy A keep walking.", "This guy is HYSTERICAL. His class is fairly easy (as easy as bio can get--some topics are just difficult by nature and that's OK), but he isn't SUPER clear on what's supposed to be on the test. With that in mind, tests are still pretty fair and he's definitely the most fun professor to take. Wish he was teaching second semester!", "Heywood is a great guy. He is full of knowledge and his passionate about the subjects that he teaches. All of his test and quizzes you can do by yourself or in groups on your own time outside of class. He gives you them a week ahead of time so you don't have to cram for anything. He tape records all his lectures and powerpoints and puts them on D2L", "Typical instructor. Didn't really do anything to stand out. Being able to right quiz 1 (IST 210) on the computers made it alot easier to get 100%.", "He is from South Africa and has the coolest accent. It's hard not to pay attention in class.", "boring, lectures too much", "Great professor. It's an easy class if you do the following, listen, learn, and pay attention to detail in what he expects on papers. He's a very fair professor and is willing to help a student at anytime.

Definitely try to take his classes!!!", "No. Just no. He should not be a professor. He is so clueless to everything that is going around. His lectures are boring and has nothing to do with the class.

He knows what he is talking about and is so funny that you want to pay attention and learn.", "No Comments", "Ebert is the worst professor I have ever had. Simply put, his ideas are outdated and his conservative ideals come through a little too frequently. Lectures are painful.", "This is a difficult subject, but Ruhi does a good job of explaining the material. Exams are tough, but they are manageable. Discussions are graded. He does have an accent, but is definitely understandable. I would recommend this professor.", "I took his inline class. Really fun guy and very helpful. Made the class challenging and interesting. I have learn a lot. I highly recommend him. You will have to work a lot.", "I am a student from Baruch College. I took his class in Spring 2004. I admit he is the worst professor in the world.

Pay attention and you can't go wrong.", "He's a great professor; very willing to help his students. Tests are okay, just study and you'll do fine. Be prepared for the labs in 430; they're fun but they may require some effort. He has definitly taught me alot because he's so enthusiastic and knowledgable about the science.", "This class was just him trying to prove to the students that he was a good parent. He is very arrogant and self consumed. He provided no help and did not even bother to learn our names. He also cancelled class way to many times, and we probably did not cover half of the material we were supposed to. If you want to learn, do not take him.", "No Comments", "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! For the people that stated he's hard, he grades hard, you cant understand him, yaddy yadda yahhhhh... your the ones that either A) tried to learn in his class and get a passing grade, B) don't know anyone from his past classes, or C) both A and B \r \r For me I was neither. find someone from his past classes and use the tests they", "I liked him. 1st day of class he said \"no one's leaving here with less than a C [unless u do absolutely nothing]\" but i took him 2 years ago hope hes still the same.

He is really helpful and understanding and is prepared to take time to go through the problems and help you get the highest grade you can.", "This professor was incredibly boring.

NOT the prof. for you!", "I dont understand how someone so arrogant can teach in a university and be an example. When he screams at you, you can see how he thiks he is cool just because of that. Really childish person, get away from him..", "His assignments are easy. Go to class and listen, you can sleep if you like. Can't review his lectures (not posted online) never follows schedule. TESTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE, LITERALLY, BUT......He curves test like none other. For example a 35/50 on one test was an A, so just study at the last minute for the tests and beat your classmates.", "complete idiot, but an easy A", "If you need history classes, do not take Douglass. He is not helpful. He is condescending. He doesn't answer questions clearly. The only grades for the semester are four book quizzes, a midterm, and a final. He grades very subjectively. Many times you don't know why he deducts points. I don't know of anybody who earned an A in this course.", "No Comments", "One of the best professors at EKU and by far the best English Professor I have ever had. So passionate and enthusiastic about English. Will do anything to help you pass the course. His goal is to have everyone of his students pass his course. That really says alot about the kind of teacher he is. Excellent person and teacher.", "I was not a fan of Human Geography however Urban Geography was my favorite class.

I would definitely take another class in the 200300 level with Dr. Eberts.", "Professor Milburn's lectures can at times be dry (due to his sometimes monotone voice), but if you are interested in psychology, there is no way to make this subject boring. His exams are easy, IF you do the online quizzes, which have all the answers in them.

He cared about my grade alot and was willing to help. Great prof!", "An excellent prof.

Only take if you love history; if your filling an elective, you're probably better off in a different class", "I do not doubt that he is a talented writer, but he seems to be at a loss for what is expected in an academic setting. His course was really just film appreciation with no academic rigour. Instructions to the class could be vague and contradictory.", "i took CC102 with Mr. Peters. Honestly, the only reason why I passed is because the class is basically common sense. He is knowledgeable and excited about the subject, but he talks more than teaches. His notes don't always align with the book. His logic & grading is confusing . He talks fast and lacks enough patience to teach a class. Avoid him.", "Almost finished with my BA in History, I really like to reflect upon my history class with Prof. Timmons. He is tough, but you will rarely find another Prof. as knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone who is serious about history or, simply enjoys actual learning and is not afraid to work for it!", "The worst teacher I have ever had. He cannot explain how to do anything relevant. The main points that you need to know come after 40 minutes of nonsense proof. Do not take him for Calculus based Physics worst teaching job ever.", "Todd is a great prof and film can be a difficult concept but he is able to put it in simple terms for new students. His quizzes are based of the film, lecture, and readings so as long as you attend class and screenings you should do well. The exams are straightforward and everything you need to know is on the study guide. He's super sarcastic too", "You have to be at a collegiate level.

And Doc Robinson was always available for appointments.", "A passionate prof. I could see how lectures could be dry if you were on fb the entire time instead of listening... listen!

My favorite class.", "very enthusiastic and engaging... and smokin' hot.", "i love how teachers talk nice about themselves on this site lol", "Other comments posted are bunk.

Plus, he's a great professor and pretty funny, too!", "he is the SWEETEST old man..he will do anything to help you out. fair and very nice!", "If you can take Dukes and avoid Lofton, DO IT.

He is very straight forward, a clear communicator and very responsive and helpful. His videos are awesome. He's hilarious, has great taste in music and is interested in the success of each of his students. Highly recommended, so much so, took a second class and will take another with him as well.", "From day one everything is given online. Assignments are given and even the essay questions for the exams and final are also given on day one.

I plan on taking all his classes", "Prof. Kojo is def. unique. he never had any lesson plans though & we just watched youtube videos all class. no need for the txtbook & doesn't give any tests but just 2 papers which were fair. Students use to always walk in after class and just sign the attendance sheet because the class would be in complete darkness while videos were running. haha", "Dr. Scanlin is such a great guy. All he wants is for his students to pass his class and do great after graduation. You pretty much watch movies every other class and he rarely takes attendance.

Awesome pro", "Lectures are boring, but what else can you expect from introductory econ?

This class might prevent me from graduating. never thought a multiply choice test could be so hard or a undergrad text could be so difficult.

He sets up the class in groups, and that works out great. At first he annoyed me, but later in semester I came to understand what a good teacher he is.

And check out his wine blog!", "Cawley is a really good professor that knows the material inside and out. He is always available, and very understanding of students.

Go talk to him too during office hours!", "Steve K. is easily the best teacher I have ever had in any subject. He cares about his students and what they learn. He is a genius when it comes to art.

I took it as a summer course and we had to jam through the whole course, but he kept things lively and even though he had so much material to cover in almost no time. I'd take his class again.

GREAT TEACHER!", "He is a nice guy, offers extra credit and is willing to help. However he isn't that clear when he speaks because he talks fast and confuses himself at times.

His tests were a bit hard though. Alot of the things on the test he did not cover in class so READ the book!", "Best professor I've ever had! I normally dread math class and do poorly in the class but this was the one exception. As long as you attend class, take notes, and make sure you do your homework this class will be fairly easy.

You only need the access code really, no point in buying the book since you can get the code separately. He tries to tell jokes, I don't think he realizes we're laughing at him not with him, but whatever.

You're graded on a couple quizzes, tests, and papers. It's lecture heavy, but the slides that go with it are pretty informational so if you miss a class or two it won't kill your grade. We read a lot, but they also go in depth about the books.", "If you go to class and do the assigned work you will most likely get an A. Dr. R is absolutely not as bad as everyone else is saying!

You can go to him for advice, anytime. His class is very easy. It includes a few papers; that?s it!!", "He's very boring and is ridiculous in grading papers. Basically if you want an A on a paper you have to dumb down your writing. If you write a paper that sounds like it came out of a real psychology journal (ie. a good paper) then he won't like it.

I've had a lot of trouble staying awake", "I just feel like he just made his course difficult on purpose . On the first day, he told us that more than 50 % of his students fail so i don't know if its his fault or the students. He gives out quizzes everyday which is fine but what he teaches in class is completely irrelevant to what he gives out just as stated in the comments below.", "I wondered why he didn't have a perfect score. Now that I see the rating criteria, he's not an easy A, and I don't think he'd want to be. The work is fair. It's college.

He just needs to retire because it's clear he's lazy", "he was so unhelpful and his lectures were took up the entire class period.", "I learned a lot from Dr. Andy about how to think and how to write. He's a funny guy who makes a reaaally long class (three hours in the summer) fly by. He makes you get to know your classmates, which is also cool.

He is challenging & awesome.", "No Comments", "This was someone that I actually rightfully trusted to discuss my future in pharmacy.

While his technique of lecturing is everything but lively, if you follow what he says, and walk off the lecture path with him, you learn alot more than with the textbook.

He's not the best teacher ever, but he's damn, damn good.", "His voice just isn't that interesting, and he seems to doze into space a lot. I found myself getting distracted because I couldn't focus on what he was teaching. The subject itself is pretty complex and therefore I personally need an enthusiastic funny teacher, especially in the morning.", "I was assigned to take 3 courses with this fellow. He is very arrogant. Teaching method is unenergetic. I have no doubt that he is very bright - verging on genius - but who can benefit with that attitude of his?", "Entertaining professor. Class is mandatory but it's not at all boring or difficult to sit through. One major health assignment, two tests and one take home final. Very easy, pretty fun and a kind and understanding professor. No class on Fridays either. You write two paragraphs a week on a health topic instead.", "There were only 3 grades - 3 short papers. That's it. Get someone to help edit your paper. Go to class. He will sometimes go over your head but read and write a well written college paper and you are fine. I got an A and it's was pretty easy.

Once the door is close we will not be allowed in the class", "He cancled class too often and the material, half was intro-psyc and the other half was his life story. This teacher is concieted and self righteous, rarely alowing students to explain themselves when a question is asked, instead he opts to hear himself speak. Easy enough if you can memorize and regurgitate. Don't take if you actualy want to learn.", "Very intense and opinionated.", "He gets angry at students from time to time, and I can't remember ever being on schedule in his class. He skips over some content in class (sometimes would ask TAs to make up for it in DGDs). The assignments are hard, but if you can do them you're good for the midterms.

I never thought that I would get Shakespeare, but he made it possible.", "Prof Harding is funny and personable. He grades a little tough but gives you the rubric before hand so you know what you're going to be graded on.

He is a fun professor and tries to make things interesting.", "I had Olguin before for political science and loved his class.

He always make jokes and share personal experience to entertain and at the same time he has a extremely detailed note coverage makes along with online proof reading.

Perhaps best, the difficult midterm and final essays are perfect practice for next month's CBEST exam.", "Dr. Kelley is unbelievably smart. Its fascinating how much he knows, but he expects his students to know the same. The class is very tough. Need to review all his lectures and the book and do the problem sets.

Not a good class at all. Worst professor in the soc department.", "Anyone who says the prof is not helpful, probably they didn't ask for help! Prof. Hassan is very helpful and caring.

You want to know how boring it is? He went over the syllabus for a week and a half...5 class meetings. And, im not kidding, it took him 35 minutes to divide the 60 student class into 8 groups.

He tries so much and though a test every class or every other class is nothing.", "Comes prepared. Mixes up teaching methods between videos, fun exercises, and 'get to know me' exercises.

However, the course was DAMN easy (the final was just 100 mulitple choice, we were given 80 in clas", "Charles O'Brien, never had I had such mixed feelings about a prof. He is a very nice guy who I believe cares about his students. Yes, he is a little awkward and stutters a bit and can't convey his ideas with clarity or precision but he is easygoing (unless you talk) and plans the course out nicely. The exams are super easy multiple choice.", "Boring lecturer, too much reading. He was equally unfocused(as Hass,0 but the class wasn't hard.

Lecture was just horribly monotonous and totally useless, rarely went.", "very easy going but completely resistant to the **** and spin - which is why some people have a problem with him.", "Worst prof i have ever had, reads off p.p. and doesnt teach the concepts, test are hard, SI himself said to me, \"he teaches at one level and expects you to know at a much higher one\" class is boring and I got nothing more out of the course then", "Pin-cushioning, Proportioning, and LowBalling. If you do any of these things will be ran over by a man with a pipe full of cherry tobacco, wearing a authentic Scottish bagpipers hat, plus he will take your house too.

Very Helpful towards students.", "He is a nice guy, but should not be teaching game design classes. He gives horrible advice that drove our project into the ground. He doesn't understand games at all. If you take any of the senior capstone classes with him, it would probably be in your favor to ignore what he advises you change about your game, which is to say everything.", "I would definitely recommend Foreman! The three week summer course was a lot of work but the class is discussion based so as long as you read the case studies you are fine. He is very laid back and entertaining. There is a lot of writing and analysis in this course, but as long as he is seeing you are putting forth effort your grade will be fine", "Good labs, lousy lectures.", "Just when I thought I couldn't take another minute of stupid multiple regression, Dukes assured me that I could! Wonderful prof and a truly decent human being.", "Eric is one of my favorite people, let alone favorite professor. His class is one of the only that I participate in. You have lots of reading assignments and they're kind of hard to understand, but they're very interesting. He gets to know his students and makes everyone feel like what they say is important. I wish I could have him for every class.", "Tests were pretty tough. All he does in class is go over homework, doesn't teach anything. Homework has nothing to do with the tests. The class average was so low he let us take the third test home, and still most people thought it was too difficult.", "He is a good teacher. In the beginning of the semester he will break the class up into groups. If your group sucks your grade could go down a couple of points. READ READ READ, that is the only way to get a good grade. And make sure that you do the quizzes those are easy \"a's\". And at the end attendence is added to extra credit.", "Super easy. Never thought I would get an A in stats. Tests are open book, open note,open computer. Plus he give a test review with all the answers. Test questions straight from review!!

Class was always eventful and challenging and focused in a weird fun sort of way. He is also invested in his students, and fully encouraging.", "The best teacher at monmouth!", "He's fairly easy, and grades on a curve. He's a pretty mellow and nice guy. Even though you don't 'have' to go to class much, I think it helps because he does a good job at explaining concepts in the book", "Does not explain his lectures very well in class, instead preferring to discuss concepts over doing actual example problems. Reading the textbook will be a must as you will probably not learn the material any other way. His tests are also poorly worded and described. Would be better if he could actually explain his lecture material.", "I signed up for this Professor's Statistics class in the summer. He was teaching methods were so unclear that I had to drop the class after two days. I do not recommend taking this class with this Professor.

Overall a very friendly guy. He should quit smoking though!", "My favorite class and professor at RU so far. He adds humor to his lectures to make it interesting.

Definitely take him if you're looking to learn a lot, work hard, & have a professor who truly cares about each of his students! I would absolutely take another class with him again.", "Extremely unintelligent, though well-intentioned. The Hunger class was a breeze if you read the books, but don't expect to learn anything whatsoever from Sanders. He spends most of class time showing videos and telling personal anecdotes. Easily distracted and incapable of clearly answering simple questions. Easy A if that's all you care about.", "Burns is amazing. If all people learned math from burns from start to finish, we would all be math wizards. He'ld give you the shirt off his back to help you out. Great guy and great professor.

A great experience.", "Watched him kick a mentally handicapped man out of his class before he turned to the man's mom and said \"don't try to back me in a corner\".

He really loves what he does and shows it in his teaching.", "No Comments", "I took him for a hybrid class and at first I honestly thought that I was going to regret it because he seemed tough. After the first few assignments and in class lectures, I was really liking the class and him as a professor. He is a super cool guy. He loves to focus on music and artists that he likes. The topic papers are different and interesting", "Dr. Blythe is good at keeping your attention. Class material is easily organized. I liked Dr. Blythe's teaching style so much that I took him again for ENG 212.", "Gosh, when I took this course (PSC 101) fall 2013 I saw that he had good rating so I decided to take him. I don't know why some people rated him 5 stars on easiness. you can NOT really understand his lecturers. his voice are very low and exams are hard Plus 10 pages term papers. The worse class I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIM.", "He is hard of hearing, but very nice and understanding. He easily gets off topic, but is funny in his own way. We learned PHP and C# and you kinda have to teach yourself.", "I love Philosophy & taking it with him was great!

BUT he will tell you when you are wrong. hahaha.", "Ed. Ed Ed Ed. I loved this class, and not only because he was sexy. He actually was passionate about the subject matter, and he helped clarify already instilled opinions I had. I can easily say this is one of the best teachers at AICOC outside of core or lab classes. I would probably take the class again if I had the money :X", "SEXY!!!! And an AMAZING lecturer!! Taken all of his classes!", "Public Speaking: Very easy. He's helpful and clear. One tip: Don't pick controversial subjects for speeches.", "By far the best teacher I have ever had. Without a doubt. He has taught me more in 2 courses than the rest of my college experience combined. The people who give him a bad rap never invested enough in their learning to understand him in the first place. The only teacher who won't waste your time, but he expects that you want to learn.", "Great Class!No exams!There are 9 2-3 pg chapter reflections,a 15 page paper, a group project and frequent class discussions.But if you take into account you have one paper due per week and the rest of the time it's just very interesting discussion with no tests to cram for.You really learn the information and it will be with you for life.TAKE HIM!", "is this even a college class? i could have made an 'A' when i was 10...very easy class...a must to take!", "Great instructor. States clear objective every class. Very organized and enjoys what he is doing. If you show up you will pass. Easy course.", "Absolutely the best professor I have taken at Assumption. He is clearly passionate about what he teaches and his lectures are so engaging and interesting. Taking Gendron made me decide to be a criminology concentrator...don't miss out on this prof!", "Very disorganized professor. He has yet to embrace the 21st century. His lectures consist of him sitting there and spewing notes with no direction, as if he is reading a Wikipedia page. It's not very clear or concise either, he's not a very good speaker. He does not tell you what he's expecting on assignments and does not respond to emails.", "No Comments", "I really liked him! He is intelligent, funny, and clear. If you're taking him for Logic in Practice, YOU NEED THE BOOK! You won't pass without it - the class is entirely based it. He conducts lectures through student participation. He is a bit of a tough grader, but you shouldn't have a hard time as long as you pay attention and know the material.", "I have never been more disappointed in my life. I have never met a more arrogant person in my life. I regret taking this class. This class and this professor are completely disjointed. To blatantly and constantly reject student opinion is NOT how you tech a class.", "Dr. Pecorino is one of the worst professors at UA. I am a straight A student, and I think he makes class as hard as he can. I do not recommend his EC 430 if you have another elective you can take.", "This guy is a hoot! He seems kinda goofy but he is sharp. Don't argue with him unless you're sure of yourself. On second thought, do try and argue with him; you'll see.

Very friendly, tests are extremely easy, but you need to GO TO CLASS!", "Doesn't do a good job teaching in class, so the homework assignments are very very difficult. Not very helpful either. Would not recommend.", "No Comments", "WORST PROFESSOR EVER, hes def. on my worst professor list. This guy has so checked out of teaching its not even funny, hes close to retirement and it shows. He didnt even correct our papers he had his grad student do it so in reality we werent even writing for him because the grad student wasnt even correcting by his guidelines! He's so boring.", "The first few lectures I was wowed with his lecturing ability. But this wore off as I realized he said the same thing over and over and over again. I also do not think that his course was well described in the description on line. The readings were horrible and most hard to understand. All he talks about: STORYTELLING. Every lecture. The whole time", "This class was extremely hard. He expects a lot from students...almost like grad school. He really knows his stuff and if you ask a question you almost always get an answer in the form of another question. His tests are really really hard. be prepared to work your ass off.", "Best teacher in the school of management, knows a lot, teaches a lot, jokes a lot, cares a lot.", "Dr. Hardy is a wonderful teacher that knows what he is talking about! A math wiz! COME to class, BE ON TIME! He seems tough but he is preparing you for the Compass Exit Exam and wants you to understand the material. He is very helpful! Come prepared, bring your book and LISTEN IN CLASS! I passed Math 98 & Compass Exit Exam. THANK YOU Dr. Hardy!", "I personally don't like him. He is not clear with the assignments he wants, he doesn't give you the grades of the assignments you turn in until the end of the semester that you receive your final grade. Never try to reach him by email, he never answers, or ask him anything after class, instead he wants you to go to his office.", "He's funny.You ave group work, which was fun and helpful.Some of the test questions sucked like the which is bigger problems. He rambles a little but otherwise he's a great guy", "wonderful professor and probably the smartest man on campus.

He is also not someone you want in your corner as he is two faced.", "It is evident that he is smart in class, but one-on-one--he is terrible (obnoxious)! He does play favorites in class! An instructor should NEVER make a student feel \"stupid!\" If we knew everything, there would be no need to even take classes. He has a huge ATTITUDE PROBLEM!", "Takes time to answer questions, eight am is too early though for any class. Otherwise a great teacher.", "By far, this is the most wonderful teacher i have ever had. He is caring, funny, sweet, helpful, everything.

I would recomend him to everyone", "Funny, bit of a smart @$$ though which can make him hard to approach. Worth taking.", "Best pick for supervisor. Provides detailed feedback. VERY respected and insightful. Lectures get long and tedious, but he provides you with all the info you need for essays. Read the material for multiple choice not just slides. SWEETEST prof. on St Pats. Often given the street name OBrizzle. Because he is our homeboy. WE LOVE HIM.", "Dr. Baker is very helpful and intelligent and definitely one of the best professors I've ever had.", "He tells you what you general things for tests and gives handouts. Pop quizzes are on vocab that you have to define from the book, and aren't really random, he tells you the class before to study. He offers help. When it comes to tests, study everything and know little details especially for short response questions. Tough grader, NO extra credit.", "He knows the material, but presents is in a dry manner. The book is interesting, but not necessary to get. Most readings are online. Attendance is taken, and could help boost grade. Papers are worth small percentages, tests worth more. Do the online practice tests (read correct answers) and you'll do well. TA is helpful.", "He is hard to hear so sit in front. Willing to help you outside of class if you don't understand. Fair, multiple choice tests, grades on a curve. Lets you use one page of notes for test. Hey guys, this is accounting, don't expect it to be fun.", "He is an amazing professor! I liked going to his class every day and he influenced me to become a sociology major. The exams can be difficult, but he gives study guides.

Martin is a absolute gentleman. open book quizs, multiple choice exams, lots of extra credits, lowered bar.. He does everything to help you pass the class. There is one minor thing about him though. Sometimes he spends too much time helping out students who falls behind. some advanced students may find this little boring..", "Prof. Horn's class is extremely difficult. Group work every single day. Daily assignments can be confusing at times. Exams are super frustrating and hard. The worst exam set up I've experienced at UVU. He seems super unapproachable in class. That being said, one on one, he is one of the nicest dudes. You can go to him and he will help you out.", "Dr.McCauley is one of my favorite Professor at York. He's very easy to approach and his teaching is very clear. All tests or exams are based on the lectures' PowerPoint.

He has an accent, but you can still understand him. Very funny aswell. EASY A+. Just do your classwork and homework and you're set.", "This class does take a lot of time and work but I believe it was all worth it in the end.

Wish you could get the same out of other teachers though, has very good ideas.", "bad", "The 2 exam format seems to be a trend of history profs. The fact that he doesn't require you to talk is a bonus since you then get participation points for free. Raising your hand is a courtesy thing since I pay to listen to him and not someone that once took a trip somewhere. He's packed with knowledge and was fun to learn from.", "I am honored to have been in his class. I wish him luck in his retirement, but I wish he wouldn't leave! He has so much knowledge to share.Very talented musician!", "Amazing Professor. It was an honour to be taught by Dr. Allard. It is clear that he is passionate about what he teaches.

What a waste of money.", "great guy i mean it funny too", "Do not take this man if you have the chance. Avoid at all costs. If you get stuck with him be prepared to lose a third of your project grades based on his opinion of your design. Design it exactly as he has written it or you get no credit no matter how functional. Says he is available outside of class. However, he is mostly unhelpful and curt.", "Best Geo teacher! helps you in his office well if you have any questions. He's really nice too.

Because he is really knowledgeable in this area he sometimes forgets that his students may not be so you need to ask him to explain in a different way.

Exams are hard and require work but he is a great.", "Reardon is one of the few engish teachers I have had that allowed for insiteful discussions instead of plenty of BS.

Overrated. Material is interesting though.", "Great Instructor. RECOMMENDED", "His class was really great. His lectures were really interesting and he used recent events so you can relate.

Excellent at teaching the material, learned tons, but tests are very specific and a total time crunch. Will to some extent be penalized if you do not think along the exact lines that he wants you to. I recommend if you want to learn, but not if you are concerned about your grade.", "Talks very quietly and drones but what he's saying is easy to understand.

Very nice to students so long as you are nice back.", "He is willing to chat about the material and help you. However, half the time his answers don't make sense.

He can be frustrating and unclear but good lecture overall.", "No Comments", "Professor Unger was very clear about his expectations and good about communication. The material was laid out in a manner that you could work at your own pace for the most part. The journal was tough but that is because it required a LOT of introspection.

He truly cares about each and everyone of us.", "No Comments", "Don't expect to get a study guide for the midterm or final. Final is worth 40% of your grade.", "Dr. Chambers is an awesome professor. Dr. Chambers just made it easier to learn biochem but you still have to study alot. anyone who complains about him was just being lazy and wanted an easy A. I just took a practice MCAT and scored 515 with no studying or practice because he makes you learn and understand not just memorize.", "class sucks", "I would not recommend this professor.

Overall, an excellent professor! I would take him agai", "He knows his stuff, but does not cover the textbook thoroughly. He tests on some things not discussed in class. Don't count on the lecture. You need to read the text. He does give helpful info and good real life examples. He requires weekly reports on an article from the Wall Street Journal.", "Easy class if you do the reading and take notes. Great professor, knows his stuff and makes it interesting, relates it to current events. I will definitely take him again.", "Amazing teacher. Intelligent & understands what hes talking about. Hard but well worth it. He teaches logic not writing logic. Very funny & loves his work. He only uses one small $20 textbook. Expect to use it a lot. My advice; you MUST be able to understand the principle AND apply it to the questions like math. Do not expect to write w/e you want.", "very cool guy. lots of industry experience.

His lectures are the ones that when you finish them, you want to tell your friends what was discussed. Strongly recommended.", "best teache i had at ru", "He has a terrible attitude to students, especially to those who come late to class. His tests are very tricky, but he appears to be knowledgeable, he requires a lot, and those who are willing to learn will be thankful they took his class.", "Lost the boat with the physics. Too MUCH PHYSICS. Stop it with the drawings! Take class if you like to tackle engineering projects. Do not take class if you have any form of sanity, whatsoever. Not a math class and do not learn much. However, he knows how to teach and for the right student, well done.", "Horrible. Even if you're interested in the subject he's teaching, don't take him.

Three blue book essays, that's it. Not very understanding, old geezer type who doesn't care about your grades. Class not overly challenging but would not recommend taking it from him.", "One of the best at HLS. It is Con Law, so it ain't easy, but he does a great job of explaining difficult and complex topics. Not the most famous Con Law prof at HLS, but far more engaged in teaching than Tribe.

Wouldn't know the topic without his notes, which are frequently incorrect.", "To all my fellow school mates, for the sake of your sanity DO NOT TAKE 1301 philosophy with this man.

One of OSU's best!", "AMAZING!!! i love this professor he is so much fun, helpful and easy. you really gonna learn hebrew with him in the fun way!", "Dr. Perkins is the best professor I have had at ACU. I am currently a MAcc student and he still goes back and reviews the basics with us. He believes strongly in understanding the fundamentals of accounting. His class is not hard if you pay attention in class and do the homework. He also makes himself very available to his students.", "Dan took the last two weeks of the semester off when material was taught (by TAs) that would make up 35% of the final exam. Tests were hard. Study at least a week in advance and read the text book. He is not a horrible man or teacher, hes just harder than other professors.. (he covered two more chapters than the other chem 2 class.)", "Attempting to stay conscious in this class takes skills beyond the average human. One of the most boring professors, I've ever had.

DO NOT TAKE.", "Very hard course... You can learn a lot, but he's not helpful, easy or clear in what he wants from his students.

He helps you to get a good mark.", "He is a really great professor that always puts his students first.", "Nice guy and very intelligent.

The class was somewhat difficult simply because it hops around so much, every week was not coherent at all, you never really know what hes going to talk about.", "Everything said is true, he is completely fantastic. The best I've had. He cares about his students and wants you to do well. He is very straightforward and understandable but even if you struggle he will help.

Attendance/Participation and homework are for extra credit, but you won't pass if you don't go. He lectures the entire class and there are homework assignments every week. The tests are mostly from the study guides which are from the homework. Go to the review session and study and it's a manageable A.", "He definitely has a passion for the spiritual side but totally lacks teaching skills.

He does take attendance, and does give somewhat difficult tests. Make sure to read in the textbook for the test! Overall loved the class!", "He's a good guy but has terrible teaching methods. Most of the learning is done through wikipedia and in class presentations done by the students. The class had potential but his method of having students teach students is terrible. Lots of work for little reward.", "Pretentieux.", "Professor Wernli is an awesome teacher who really knows his stuff.

If you blow off the class you will fail, but I took 14 hours this semester and have an A in his class.", "This guy is crazy, and I mean that in the best way possible. He's very intelligent, almost awkwardly so, and has a really out-there way of lecturing. He's very random too; there's rarely a downright boring day, and it's gotten progressively more interesting as the class goes on. The material doesn't really interest me and I had a bit of difficulty on one of our papers, but he took the time to explain what he wanted in the paper to me, even though I STILL didn't get it after the fifth explanation.", "First let me state that I HATE MATH! Bob however was the best math teacher I ever had. He moves fast and writes a lot of notes...BUT I got it! It is the way he explains it..and if anyone didn't get it..he always would spend time after class explaining it until we did get it!! GREAT TEACHER!!", "Better than Davis I sure say that", "Ed is a good man, but he can put people off. Sometimes he says or does things, sometimes he uses a tone, sometimes he makes people feel stupid when they don't necessarily deserve it.

Outstanding teacher!", "One of the best math 80 teachers!! He assigns homework but it is similar to what will be on the test. He sets you up for success in his class.

EVER. he's very understanding, he loves teaching, and it matters because when a teacher loves to teach, students will actually understand better", "Dr. Kelley definitely knows a thing or two about chemistry, and that enthusiasm shows. What he is not great at, though, is teaching concepts. That's where the textbook comes in, and reading the textbook is 100% necessary to do well in this course. Listen to him when he says to make flashcards; they will actually help.", "A really smart guy, and a good teacher. He's really god at making discussions interesting, and I don't think he's monotone at all. If you show an interest in the subject, he will respond with great positivity.", "Very good teacher.

Unclear, arrogant, condescending. Switch sections, or good luck.", "Peters is a nice guy, his office is open a lot if you need to ask questions. His classes involve a lot of reading, lectures almost everyday, a short paper, a research paper, and about 3 exams which are challenging but not impossible.", "It's a pleasure to add to the growing list of positive comments for this professor. He is among the most helpful, straightforward, and easygoing members in the history department.", "I don't know how anyone could say anything negative about this prof.

Extreamly inconsiderate person, doesn't allow you to go to the bathroom. Treats students like they are in highschool. Makes his class out to be best devry has.

Droge totally had a point to everything he said. A lot of fun, very entertaining, hecka weird. Sorta offensive, don't take it personally. Really appreciated him a quarter lat", "Best MIS professor, hands down. Cares about his students and is always approachable. Tests are long and comprehensive but the curve is insane, so don't sweat it. Genuinely seems interested in the course material. Very passionate about computing, and he uses a mac so I will give him points just for that fact.", "Dr. Chambers is very knowledgeable, passionate, and funny. I took this course in fall because the other easy professors were taken, and I am glad I did. I been studing for the MCAT and this class made the bio-chemical section a breeze!

Would take him again!", "Jorgensen is the best professor in the department bar none. Lectures, handouts and video documentaries are all quite educational. Jorgensen is truly an inspiration.", "Good teacher. Helpful, if you are here to learn about stats he can help you understand it by simplifying it.

I would recommend him to my friends", "Really smart and really passionate about the subject, but he didn't really discuss the novels we read as much as I would've hoped.

After the first test I stopped attending class, I recieved an A overall. Felt like a waste of money.", "Rick is an awesome instructor! I am about to take my third class from him. If you are easily offended or want someone to reassure you all the time, he not the teacher for you. Rick will give you the easy A but if you want to learn he has a lot to teach you! Go to the first day and you will know if you are going to enjoy his class.", "Long answers to short questions. Funny guy, very very helpful.", "He is a very good professor. All you need to do is do the assignments and make sure you turn it in on time. The exams were multiple choice and short essay. The essay questions are usually given out a week before the actual test. I think if you do all the work you should be fine. Excellent professor and very helpful.", "Professor Zorn is awesome! Super hippy and laid back.. He tends to talk a lot but he's a funny guy.there are only 3 assignments for the whole quarter and there pretty easy. He's just a tough grader but his main motive is to prove that you improved. I definately reccomend taking him for an easy laid back class. Plus he cancels classes all the time.", "Professor Strong is a good man, who genuinely cares about hes students. The test are hard because he doesnt want students to memorize the material but to understand how it works. He get nicer as the semester progress, so dont give up quickly. For example he starts giving reviews for test, broad reviews, but they do help. If you do the work, study hard and come to class theres no need to worry.", "This is a non-major Biology class. This is a free-giveaway course just to boost up your GPA. Just take it and you will get an A. Lots and lots of extra credit.", "Best Prof Ive ever had.", "GREAT PROFESSOR! Prepared, prompt, interesting, and fair. He is to the point and business like but is very open to students and helping solve problems.He does answer emails but very quick and direct. I would recommend to anyone. He tries hard to make material relevant and include all of class in discussion.", "This professor is quite possibly the best I've taken so far. English is definitely his 2nd lang. but his teaching is better than all the other teachers i have taken so far. He grades extremely fair. And if your motivated, there is no reason why you won't get an A in his class.

Has taken 3 shots of pure caffeine in the morning to be jumpy during class as he explains and jumps around from topic to topic with no clear relation.Thinks he is the smartest man in the world. Biggestego", "HATED THIS CLASS. Although he may be a 'nice old man' he is nearly impossible to understand, & is the most UNFAIR grader I have ever encountered - does not care how much effort you put in studying wise, there is NO CHANCE of extra credit & his advice 'do better on the next one'. I would NEVER take a class with him again if you paid me.", "liked to discus off the reading information, showed lots of videos, easy \"assignments\", all papers for the grade, NO BLUE BOOKS, and VERY interesting", "Awesome fellow", "Boring professor. Takes student suggestion, works through it, THEN states that it is erroneous. Tests seemingly don't correlate with HW material. Absolutely horrible.", "One of the better UVIC Visual Arts profs, informed and less conceited than most in the field.

He had some cute in class experiments too. All around definitely a good engr 225 prof.", "The lectures are sleep-inducing unless u participate, he gives lots of credit if u do.

Sometimes he expects you to know everything and when you ask help from him he'll be \" You should know this\" . yeah if i knew everything i wouldn't come to you and ask for help. His test are pretty okay if you study well from his study guides.", "This man is a lunatic. He managed to turn a history class into a literature course. I left his class with less knowledge about the world post-1500s than when I went into it. He does care about his students. However, he has one teaching style and that is it.

Loved it!", "Tough tests, but he was easy to follow in lectures.", "I didn't enjoy his lectures. I often felt that they had nothing to do with the subject matter.

The study guide gave you the answers for the test, you just have to memorize it.

You cannot argue with him at all. He is right. Period.", "If science isn't your strong subject, Mr. Ebert may not be the teacher for you. He is extremely nice and wants you to learn and succeed. However, he expects you to REALLY KNOW EVERY DETAIL. And yes, the labs are rather looong and un-exciting. There was 3 exams(mult choice) and quizzes for each lab. Great teacher, but overwhelming.", "Best math teacher I have ever had. He taught math is a way I could understand and always available for help.

You have input and can easily understand what is wrong with your paper. Unlimited rewrites secures an easy A.", "I PROMISE you...you'll be thankful for his \"strict\" teaching method! It's actually necessary for him to teach in such a way, it helps you understand the language at the most vital stage. I'm so thankful he instilled fear in me to make sure my work was done and vocab was memorized. People who don't appreciate it don't deserve to learn Russian.", "Dr. Liff is awesome. Really helpful. I had him for a summer course and it was really easy. You're able to be exempt from every test, including the final. If you took physics in high school, you'll be fine. He's one of the funniest teachers I've ever had. Definitely need to take him as a teacher.", "No Comments", "Great professor! Records every lecture and puts them online in case you miss class. Doesn't grade labs. Makes the class accessible; if you do the work it is impossible to not get an A!

Funny too.", "I am currently a junior student in his studio, and I could not be more happy of the fact that he is my clarinet professor. I was mediocre before I started my clarinet journey at WVU, and now I'm at a point I never thought I could reach. Yes, he does have high standards and he can be harsh, but it is to push you to aim high and improve.", "Teaching middle school ed was a fun class.

He is a good teacher!!", "Attendance was so low for every class, and fellow students constantly brought computers to surf facebook during lectures. Gordon could have made the classes dry and unbearable, but he really made them fun. As long as you study what he goes over on the exam review, the tests are simple.

An asset to the school and our community.", "Great guy. Very open to helping you as long as you try.

Totally knowledgeable in his field, but he understands that students are not, and that is why we are in class to begin with.

One of the best!", "very boring teacher, tests are ok but you have to study a lot", "He only teaches using PowerPoint slides which you can also get from the textbook's online site.

Thanks Doc.", "Exams were extremely difficult (10 questions free response no curve) I would not recommend this professor very fast course.", "He is so entertaining. He is so funny. But I felt like I did not learn all that much. We had a lot of in class discussion and it was based mostly on the chapter reading for that week. Weekly discussion questions on myclasses. He loves what he does and has a variety of experience which I thought was really cool.", "He relies very heavily on his power point slides. Most, if not all, of his lecture is simply reading what the slides say. He also moves too fast at times, and says that the slides will be available on his website, though they were not available until a week before the exam. Do the readings! They round out the important concepts in lecture.", "WONDERFUL PROF! well, actually he's called coach, but who cares? the class is easy if you work on the music. and we get to go to New York and sing in Carnegie Hall too!", "Very knowledgeable prof in MCC dpt. Widely covered issues and more-than-interesting lecture that makes legal issues interesting and inspiring. Although course work is a little bit heavy, not a big deal if you can handle Intro to media study well. DO NEED RESEARCH AND FINAL PAPER", "Litterly studied so hard, and the final didn't make any logical sense.

Hasn't mastered material.", "No Comments", "He has a huge ego, he likes to single out students in class and embarrass them for answering questions wrong and thinks he is a lot better of a teacher than he actually is.

So worth it for the cost!! Everyone should take self-defense. I would take it second time.", "Solid professor for the most part. Homework load is insane if you have other heavy courses. If you love to read and write take his class. He can be a bit arrogant at times, but he is very qualified and knows his stuff.

Unfair, hard to understand, and just overall terrible!!!", "Great examples. Smartest member of the Clinton administration.", "I took his class in the summer and hate history, but I loved this class because he was hilarious and told really funny stories about his life that related to the topic.

He is very sweet and understanding. Also he will take time out of his schedule to help you if you need it. Highly recommended!", "Class is very interesting and challenging itself.

Very, very frustrating.", "After taking Spanish-301 with Professor Yager, I took Spanish-331 with him a year later based almost entirely on the fact that he was teaching it.

Genuinely cares about the well-being of his students and understands the students' perspectives.", "Guy lets you know exactly what he expects at the beginning of the semester.

You won't need to do the readings.", "This dude moves super fast, has a thick accent, and has a grading scale which means its hard for you to improve your grade if you're not one of the smart people.

I messaged him at least four times a month for the entire summer and he answered 3 times.", "He is a little hard to understand at first, but just make sure to do all the work he gives you. It may be a lot, but it guarantees you a decent grade. Sometimes his explanations aren't great, but you can look in the book if you're confused.", "Worst class I have taken at BU. Professor not engaging and tests were not relevant to exams. Most test questions were insignificant facts etc. Sitting through the 80 minute class is extremely boring.

Learned alot too. Highly recommended", "Jason has inspired me more than any other teacher I've ever had. He's a delightfully funny guy but more importantly, he LOVES what he's teaching. He's influenced me to realize that I am indeed an Interactive Media major. Thank you, Jason.", "GREAT professor. Probably one of my favorite professors at Conn.

A really nice professor and made you want to learn.", "I am his students in China. He is very very cool!! Strongly recommend him!", "Professor Reed is a good guy, but his lectures tend to drag on and he goes off topic a lot. The grading system for this course was WACK.

Labs let out early often, so over-all I would say he was a decent professor if you need to get this class out of the way.", "The tests are very hard, but I got a C on each one of them and came out with an A in the class because he grades on effort.

Claims to be a generous grader but in reality is harsher, more nit-picky, and less forgiving grader. To be fair, he always offers private office hours to those who need it. I unfortunately did not benefit much frm thos", "He's a really cool prof. He's young and has kids, so he knows what it's like to have a life outside of classes. The textbook is useful, but most of the testing materials come from the lectures. He also tells you what is going to be on each test, which are not cumulative.", "i want to be just like kowalka!! he is a great guy and very understanding! although you don't do much in his class...the stories that he tells teach you everything you need to know and expect about teaching!!! THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!:)", "His classes are fun and entertaining. Really smart guy but kind of disorganized in his teaching methods. Extremely practical. You are not clear as to how to study for the exams.", "Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Jim won't ever criticize any artwork, but will give his opinion to improve on it meaning take it home and touch up on it for the final portfolio. You can't be lazy in his class or you will get the grade you deserve. He will give you his undivided attention as long as you need.", "As much as I love Professor Kelley, I dislike his teaching methods. If you really want to understand orgo, read ahead cause in class, he assumes you already have and just starts speaking another language entirely to you. memorize everything he writes and i think you'll be fine cause thats what he puts in his paragraphs on the exams!", "Great Chef and teacher. Just wished they would let him teach during the day.", "AMAZING PROFESSOR! I wish i can take him again for another class..", "Dr. Frank loves to teach and it shows! He goes at a pace where everyone can keep up. If anyone has a problem he will take the time to help. I had him for both lab & lecture and would definetly take him again.", "Fantastic Professor. Easy to understand and always lets lecture out early. Never assigns homework or quizzes so all your grades come from tests. Such a great teacher that you're always prepared for the test.", "Avoid if possible. He is very smart & he knows it, often being rude to students in class and answering questions with other questions. If you haven't taken AP Chem, he is not the prof for you. His hw isn't impossible if you start ahead of time, but I study & understand the material & attend every class and still do badly on his tests.", "Two personalities, a friendly face in class and nasty and mean comments through e-mail.", "He changed my life for the better.", "great professor...he will hellp anyone that asks", "Mr. Hood is very unfair with his grading policies. He is one of those teachers who TRY HARD to take points off of assignments, and with lab worth only 300-350 pnts, each point counts. SLU overall seems that way now, trying to weed people out, especially in chem lab. Don is not of any help, nor is he courteous when students have questions. Arrogant.", "Great teacher, there are no suprising or difficulty to the test! He is a smart ass, but thats what makes him cool, \" take a joke you sensitive losers!\" The information is up front and easy to learn. I reccomend for a fair and easy A", "Dr. Sambrook is awesome! You have to take the time to build a relationship with him! He is shy... talk to him and he will talk back! I went the whole summer with him to Ecuador and had an absolute blast with him! He wrote me the most touching letter of reference so I could become a teacher! If you are bored... you are boring!", "His class was a total waste of time and tuition. Don't take this class unless you can quote the Bible offhand and take religious text at their literal meaning. You won't talk about any typical \"english\" topics in this class, - it's purely religion. In fact, I just realized something: THIS SHOULD NOT BE AN ENGLISH CLASS. IT IS THEOLOGY.", "The class was fine. You are allowed to take notes into the exams. So long as you put in the hours to prepare there is no problem.", "totally excellent", "Awesome professor...pushes you to strive for the best...those who don't like him much have never really taken the time to get to know him, or they are probably failing his class because they don't do their work or read. I've had him for all four years and he's my advisor. I have nothing but good things to say about him.", "No Comments", "I took a 3 week summer course with Foreman. The class was brutal, and I don't recommend the summer course. Foreman is a great guy, knowledgeable, entertaining, and fair but one of the toughest profs for this class. You will do about 10 case studies, have 2 tests, 2 group projects, and a presentation. If you do all of the work Foreman will pass you.", "Took the online class, VERY time consuming. Not to mention you must buy 3 of his textbooks which COD doesn't even carry. I got an A because I sucked up in the papers I wrote (you have to write an 800 word essay a week) His book Compassion is very difficult to understand. Really struggled through the whole thing. Wouldn't reccomend him for online.", "I love math it's easily my favorite subject. This professor is very passionate and does an excellent job of explaining things. I'm not a fan of liberal arts math because I hate word problems, he does an amazing job teaching and it was np for me. Attendance isn't mandatory but I took it as express and if you skip, you will easily fall behind.", "He's great!", "Love him!", "Great teacher and an even better guy. Anyone who likes philosophy needs to take at least one of his classes.", "Worst teacher at UA! We pay too much for him to be a professor here.", "He is extremely helpful!

It seems that all the good teachers have dissapeared and left us with brainless and boring professors! For goodness sake John,get on the horn and do something about it! Cheers -Franco", "Avoid him if you can, but if you do take it from him, be sure to read the book, it is a good way to learn the material. Much better than lecture.", "his lectures are either really intriguing or extremely boring!!!!!!!!! he doesn't find that medium or balance and he almost seems biased most of the time...i'd be careful about taking him... but he does his job", "Class was a lot of fun and incredibly interesting. I learned about things that I did not even know were things.", "Thom wants what he wants and is fair and resonable. he allows you to write on ANY topic, so some of the peer stuff is interesting, but it's cool to have that freedom. Good input!", "Really good professor. He cares about his students and always wants them to improve. He knows everyone fears of public speaking but he makes the class a friendly environment. Tests are easy. Never opened the purple book. I used the white one to help me with our speech outlines. Very kind. You have 6 free absence passes. If you go over, you fail.", "If you can get past the 8:00AM class and sit through his sometimes boring lectures, you'll do fine. Just keep up with notes. His slides are very helpful and the suppliment's amazing. He seems like a really great guy he just gets a little nervous. No homework - but keep up on your studies.", "i have to agree with the people who wrote before me. szura is definitely a jerk! in last semester's class, no one had a 90 average. he said the top 4 students were going to get A's. i was in the 4th spot, but he gave me a B+. i will never forget what he did to my psychology GPA. it went from a perfect 4 to a 3.95 because of his unfair grading!", "This class is good for an easy grade. You don't learn anything. If you are majoring in history, find another professor. You will not learn a thing, but you will get an good grade.", "I don't understand why everyone thinks he's easy and funny. A lot of times we just sat and watched movies, and he gives out quiz questions abstract from the plot of the readings. I talked to him about my falling grade, he told me he didn't care, without giving me any suggestions.", "DO NOT miss lecture ... You'll fail the Lecture Exams & won't receive iClicker credit... STUDY for lab tests (Microsoft, Excel, Powerpoint) through Simnet... If you miss class you can learn the information from the text book, but it's not as easy to understand so I don't recommend it", "The most accurate review I've read of this prof is the one below me. Rest are exaggerating. YES, it's tough. But do you really think nursing school is easy? Sorry to say, heck no. And about the accent, really? If normal human can make it through his class, everyone can. It's not hard to understand him. He teaches excellent and is a doctor himself.", "No Comments", "Extremely unorganized lectures. Nearly impossible to take notes from. Rarely has a physics demo actually work.", "one of the best courses at Tech taught by a very good/efficient teacher. Karthik is a nice person, very approachable and very meticulous in his work. Enriching experience !", "Dr. A is an amazing director. He will push you and others in the choir harder than any other director. You will learn how to make near flawless music for the purpose of delivering beautiful texts and messages. A once in a lifetime opportunity to work with a musician of his calibre.", "This class does move rather quickley, it goes from the Chauvet Caves to Gehry's Guggenheim in Bilbao. Online quizzes fairly easy if you keep up on the readings, the midterm and finals are tough (lots of slide memorization) Many slides in ARH 101 overlap with 7 Pleasures", "I felt really awkward asking him any questions because he's hard to understand. You get really easy points for quizzes and labs but the exams are only 20 questions so you really need to know the material. Tough to get an A, but he helps as much as he can.", "His lectures are boring and just talk. Does hand out notes. His test are amazing, not easy, but well made. You can reason out questions and he will accept them if your reasoning is sound. Not a my way or the high way teacher, as long as you prove your answer. Learn the fundamentals of physics by heart and you will pass his class.", "This class was challanging but it was also a 400 level class. Anyone who thinks they are going to float through this class without doing work, is wrong. He is a tough grader but a great teacher. Work hard and you will do well!!", "Prof. Ream is one of the nicest professors out there. He's a little awkward but super patient and willing to help students. However, his lectures are disorganized and undefined. Math doesn't come easily for me so, although I'm a hard worker and I took lots of notes, I did have to spend a lot of time in the tutoring center to get a better grasp", "Scripps is a bad ass dude. Take this thug for your classes because he's a great teacher. Scripps if life. Scripps is love. Scripps is all.", "The lectures are pretty mediocre and there's a heavy workload for a 3 credit hour class. Your final grade is basically how much time you spent outside of class so it's 100% possible to get an A if you're willing to put in the time. If you're not a history buff and just looking to get a gen ed requirement I suggest you look elsewhere", "easy, that is all I have to say. he is a really nice guy", "Okay, so the trick with Kaminsky is you go to him every chance you get to check your projects. If you follow the examples you're given and he approves of it you're basically golden, otherwise, you're in trouble. Probably gave me the most anxeity of any professor I've ever had though.", "The reports were a little annoying and time consuming to do. However, most of the assignments were very reasonable. The midterm was right from the notes and pretty straight forward and so was the exam. The prof is nice and articulate. Go for it.", "He isn't anything special that for sure. Sits there and reads everything from a powerpoint. I showed up on the test days, and thats it. Studied from the book. The grading is pretty easy, there are five tests and a final all worth 100 points and you get to drop the lowest test grade for a total of 500 points. So you can bomb one test and be fine.", "BEST PROF EVER! HE IS AWESOME AND HE WILL ALWAYS HELP YOU! HIS QUIZZES ARE EASY JUST WATCH THE NEWS! LOOKS LIKE HE GETS HIS NEWS FROM CNN MSNBC AND SOME LOCAL STUFF! HE WILL ALWAYS MAKE CLASS FUN!", "Jerry is an amazing teacher. He's super helpful and involves everybody in the class. He's super easy to talk to-- in office hours and out. He takes time to learn about each one of his students. His class is so much fun-- he's hilarious! He'll make you like math more than you did previously, guaranteed.", "I first took this class with Robert Ridge. Both professors are good and give good demonstrations, but Matheson did more demonstrations and his slides had more images. As a visual learner that was very valuable to me. I understood much more in his class. Tests are in class. I recommend him to students who are single parents due to his flexibility.", "He's the worst professor I have ever had. I learned nothing of substance, he nitpicks on quite literally every single possible thing you can nitpick on, and his grading scheme is there to the detriment of students. I read these reviews while picking classes last semester but didn't think it was going to be _this_ bad.", "I love Hupp as a professor! This is my second time taking him and i have zero complaints. The field study was super easy. Only 1 easy test, and paper that is really your reference letter for him to write. Take him for any class he offers, great professor!", "No labs and no assignments, which makes learning linux challenging. Keeping good notes is imperative as he imparts all of his knowledge to you via lecture. This is an advanced class and you are on your own for developing hands-on practice strategies and methods. I did learn a lot though.", "Prof.Wernli is a great Teacher, pretty funny and very informative. Sometimes he gets off track but it helps if your taking him Flex in a 4 hour class. Weekly quizzes and extreme use of the textbook. Biology for Science Major.", "he knows his stuff, maybe a bit too demanding", "This guy is pretty cool! I nice guy in general but also teaches a really fun class. I enjoyed learning all the video editing equipment and Premiere. I also had tons of fun shooting videos with my group!", "Hes a thorough instructor. If your a math or engineering major hes your guy. If not, like I am not, then he is not your guy. Got an A but he defiantly makes you work for it. Will ensure you are prepared for future math classes.", "Great teacher! The Professor hands you an A, but it's up to you to go and get it. You have to attend for the quizzes which are basically completion grades, and the two major tests are all open book online. If you care about your grade, you'll get your A. I also learned a bit as well. Opens many ways to earn extra bonuses credits. 1 LOWEST GRADE DRO", "No Comments", "Best professor at Queen's. Hands down.", "Defiantly the best professor I've had for GEN chem. But the class is still hard. I got an A using Study Edge. They really help to explain and emphasize the most important things Talham goes over. 100% recommend going to the weekly review sessions with Study edge made a huge difference when it came to the exams.", "This is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. In a philosophy class, he discusses environmental issues. It is also a how-to for moodle. Never seen a teacher go so crazy with that website.", "Excellent professor, knows his stuff, excellent sense of humor. Does expect students to have an open mind, show some interest in the subject, and spell check their papers.", "No Comments", "so knowledgeable!!!", "I have to say Ernie Rice is helpful, no doubt about it. However, he is authoritarian in class. He confiscated an adult's cell phone. He is really crass, unprofessional, verbally abusive (he will try his best to make you look stupid). He IS very full of himself, his opinion is to be taken as gospel. Overall, not a very likeable person.", "His class was easy, but that's probably because ENGR 101 is easy. I still don't know how I did in the class, because he never gave us back our project grades! Very unclear when assigning things to work on and doesn't hand back things he graded. He's okay for 101, but I wouldn't want to take him for any other class.", "I dont like the way he teaches. and he is the most borning professor I have ever had!", "Wonderful professor if you're willing to work. Knows his stuff, gets things done in class. You definitely get your money's worth in his class. But he won't tolerate idiots. (If you had problems with one of his classes, you might fall into this category).", "Highly adored. Very friendly and willing to help. He makes you feel comfortable learning the subject matter. Not an easy class. My \"B\" is well-cherished.", "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Excellent teacher! The lecture is fun, he takes time to make sure everyone is on track, the homework isn't overwhelming, and he is pretty hilarious. I really don't see how anyone wouldn't like Phil unless they fall into the \"didn't work, got poor grade, must be teacher's fault not mine\" category...", "No Comments", "Kaufman is very easy-going and his open class discussion instead of lecture keeps me awake and involved in class, motivating me to express my opinions and thoughts. If not interested in class discussion though, it can get pretty boring - his voice does have a slight drone to it but he can be funny.", "He is crazy, he wants to learn a chapter a week. The midterm was six question for 8 chapters and the final 8 questions for 12 to 15 chapters. if it is not done the format he wants it to be it is wrong no matter what. Please Stay away. Any teacher is better than him trust me especially for pharmacy majors. You will end up repeating it again.", "as long as you took this in high school, you should be fine. most of the time he talks about the current events going on. easy to pass.", "Does not teach/explain things well. terrible.", "Professor Raj is an all around good professor. He is clear and you will understand the material. His tests are not easy but they are not overly difficult if you pay attention. I would recommend him for DBC.", "His class is difficult, but as long as you study and go to class it's really not that bad. The lab TA is very helpful too. Panter cares about the class and really enjoys talking about rocks. He is easy to understand. I hated the class. It's boring. Rocks are not my thing. But it's definably doable as long as you give it a chance and study.", "No Comments", "Really great guy, will go great lengths to help you understand, and truly seems to enjoy teaching. My only gripe is that if you zone out for three seconds, you will be entirely lost in his lectures. Further, his notes are not exactly the best to study from, but I know he means the best.", "Good professor. Went a little fast at times which was hard for us non=computer people but all in all a good class. WAY better than Quant 1!!!", "Mr. Betts is really into helping students become all they are capable of. I'm a shy person and hate public speaking; he realizes this and grades accordingly. He doesn't let you slip by but grades you low enough to push you to progress. I think all it takes to be successful is your own willpower and motivation, not being a good speaker.", "Good professor, I personally liked his method of teaching. People complaint about having to read the book but come on, this IS COLLEGE, you are expected to read the book.", "1 classwork and 1 homework assignment is due each week. This class only meets once a week for 10 weeks so I think the work is fair and extremely easy. He wants all his students to pass. You have to sign in every class but you can leave as soon as you finish your classwork. Highly recommend!", "He is my favorite teacher by far. he is so enthusiastic about everything he teaches. this class is a wonderful history class, and if you want to learn about religion, or crazy roman fights, or scandelous stories then take this class from Mark! p.s. I seriously would of had to try to get a bad grade on the tests cause they were that easy.", "Easy class. He is a bit unclear with his instructions at times though. He *never* answers pm's on etudes. I took it online and you have to come to campus for the exams & final. Textbook with required homework assignments is very overpriced. If you understand computer basics, then this is an easy A class.", "Very traditional teacher but more than fair.

I've never met a person so kind.", "Extremely chill. 2 weekly assignments, one in class, one for homework. He tells cheesy jokes every class and is super cool. It is a credit/no credit class and he grades mostly off of participation (completion of assignments). Very easy class with only a little bit of experience with excel.", "Best and smartest teacher ever!", "Mr. Abert was not my favorite professor. There were times that he would preform examples in lecture wrong, and he could not correct them. The lectures were unclear and hard to follow. Also, the tests were very hard compared to examples we had done in class and after talking to classmates, it was a communal feeling that we were not prepared for them", "stinko", "doctor peters is a fabulous math teacher, although he is a ridiculously picky grader!! as long as you follow his format on the board and make sure to copy it directly in your notes so that you can mimick it for tests/quizzes, you should be okay!! he's funny, too.", "My favorite teacher I have had at eku. I have took him for everything he teaches. He is a must take.", "Lectures explain reading well and you can choose topics for your papers (only 2). Don't expect to leave class early.

Just fill them out and study them and youre all good.", "Very laid back and easy going, very fun teacher.... only bad thing is he is a state fan! lol", "This SFI class was definitely my favorite course from my first year at SSU.

Good guy.", "I spent a year and a half getting to know math again and was just starting to learn it, love it, breathe it. After this class, I almost never want to see another math equation.

Great guy, but ruined my confidence in my math abilities completely.", "prob wrote it himself", "No Comments", "He's good at the subject and u do learn from his class.

If you want to sleep through class or expect him to give away grades... choose a class that you can pass without learning. He will explain concepts over and over until everyone understands.

I would take him again.", "When I walked into the class, I already had 6-7 years of classical guitar lessons. When I played for him, he really beat me up over technique, and I hated him for it, but kept coming to class anyways. It really payed off. This guy is brutally honest, but he genuinely cares about you. Take him, no matter what level you are, you will learn a lot.", "He is awesome. grades are only tests. attendance is 4%, but i recommend you attend every class because he explains the information thoroughly.

Tests are just the midterm and final; he gives you study guide and practice with the class before the test and there is an essay question for the test, he gives you the prompt so you can be prepared. Individual presentation is 10%. He just gives you a question and you have to find it in the book and present it in class.", "I rated the easiness a 1 for the avg person who knows nothing about Anat. Rude and uptight? He's just a grumpy guy who is bored. (quite humerous). Take him if you think you have what it takes. He's not easy, but the class is doable for an A.

The teacher was very nice also!", "Amazing professor", "Funny guy, which always helps in keeping the attention of the students, especially in lecture. Fairly easy grader, but tough subject overall. If you do your job (as a student) he'll go above and beyond his job, as a teacher, to ensure that you comprehend this tricky subject. Recommended.", "makes you work like crazy to earn your grade, but you learn so much...and he's a really fair grader, which is always good", "Eierman is a great guy. He is extremely helpful at almost anytime of day. Exams and labs are kind of difficult, but he'll always answer questions. Good professor.", "Nice, passionate, helpful... But tough grader FOR SURE", "Funny guy, picks favorites, wierd grading style and lecturer...", "IT ALL DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO TAKE 5 MINUTES TO READ FROM THE BOOK AS WELL AS THE CLASS NOTES. THERE IS NOTHING NEW THAT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE. TRY TO GET NOTICE WITH QUESTIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.", "The good, he gives you the notes and the sample problems. The bad is that the lectures are dull and less exciting than just reading the book. He has a particular way that you have to work problems on test, but does not use that method when showing problems. All of your points lost will be format errors. Not cause you didn't understand the subject.", "I loved this class. He teaches from a sociology perspective and you learn so much. Quirky, blunt sense of humor-- and tells the wildest stories. One assignment per week, with a final at the end of the course. Show up to class, and do the weekly assignment. The classroom dynamic is lowkey and comfortable. Super cool guy. Highly recommend him.", "Professor Douglass is the worst professor I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! Attendance is mandatory, (you get three skips, then he says you fail the class), hard to understand, doesn't use blackboard or power points, never smiles, need I say more? Find another professor so you actually have hope of passing History and not having to retake it!", "Prof. Strong really cares about you. Yes, his tests are difficult but coming from a former professor from UT Health, what do you expect? He trains you for nursing school because keep in mind, nursing school is not easy. I recommend taking him if you can accept the challenge because in the long run, you will learn an awful amount.", "don't take him!", "It's a very interesting class. There are a lot of notes though. The tests are over 100 questions, but he gives a great curve. He's a nice professor and gives pretty interesting lectures.", "Amazing!!! He is a profound teacher who makes you think, is very funny, and gives you goosbumps when you hear his stories. His passion shows through his lectures. He is the reason I want to persue a career in the study of Holocaust history.", "excellent professor", "I think Mr. Vandergrift is a great teacher. You absolutely must be on time and pay attention and that is really all he is picky about. It is a hard subject but he tries to make it fun. The tests are hard but fair and I would take him again if given the chance. If you really care to learn he is the man to take, he knows his subject well.", "Currently taking this class. Englander is an excellent professor. The material is hard but if you pay attention its really not that bad. Tests are challenging but you can bring a page of notes and he is generous with points. I definitely recommend taking a class with Irv. He's worked with computers since they were invented and he knows his stuff.", "He was a great teacher and will be missed.", "\"For the question J^j, to find the cost is like to find the dampning of the water waves or in an engine oscillating motion.\" To sum things up, he is rarely on track with what he is doing", "just talk in class and you'll do fine", "The class consists of just 3 exams, which are each 100 q's multi choice. He doesn't care if you are there or not. He only cares about your grades on the exams. Lectures can make you fall asleep. Textbook is needed. There is a lot of reading for the exams. He is a really funny guy, and definitely makes some interesting jokes if you catch them.", "Dr. Midkiff is one of the most liked and respected professors in the ME department. He regularly assigns homework dealing directly with the material that will be on the test and devotes almost the entire class to working example problems so that you can actually figure them out on your own. His lectures are useful and he has a good sense of humor.", "I have never been that interested in science, but Bob Filson was one of my favorite professors. He made the class fun and his lectures were actually INTERESTING! The tests were hard, but easy to make up for in other areas. I am totally amazed thinking back on how much I learned from his class. I actually looked forward to it every day!", "easy, fun and great", "Not too bad. Corny jokes and Dilbert strips liven up class", "No Comments", "waste of money.. was not helpful at all", "He constantly goes off on tangents that don't connect with the lesson. If you miss one class might as well not show up for the rest of the semester.", "AMAZING Professor! Honestly one fo the BEST I've ever had. Polisci isn't my major, I signed up for the class because I needed a fourth class. I went to meet with him before and he was great, nice and passionate about teaching as well as the topic itself. Easy to ask help, kept my attention, learned more than any other class I've taken!", "This class is the easiest i have ever taken. He is a little boring and rambules a lot. But he gives all take home quizes and all the questions for the mid-term and final are from the quizes.He is a sweet older guy.", "couldn't wait for it to be over!", "Nice guy, but class amounts to nothing more than long drawn-out Crystal Ball demo's. He messes with the lighting in class constantly during these. Also he has different expectations for \"performance levels\" between his quizzes and tests - a tidbit he will not mention to you until after the fact.", "Fonseca is a fun teacher, but his 349 class can go either way. It is very easy to slack off in that class as there is little HW and attendance is optional (posts lectures online). He is from Costa Rica, so he has an accent. If you go to class and stay on top of the material, you should be fine. Slack off, and you will regret it.", "Dr. Thielen is awesome. He does such a good job at engaging the students in interpersonal comm. He gives you every opportunity to make up lost points with multiple extra credit options. If you don't do the work you won't pass but you will have ample time to do it and its very easy work. I would take this class again, thats how good it was.", "I dreaded Physical Science before the semester started; I never would have guessed it would end up being my favorite class! I really appreciate how this class broadened my understanding of science and how the material was clear, but also challenged my mind. I learned a lot, I laughed a lot (like, a LOT), and I'm really going to miss this class.", "There is a reason Grout is so loved on campus. He is a kind man with immense knowledge and passion for architecture and teaching. While he is one of the easiest History of Arch professors, students are happier and generally more interested in learning with him than in other classes. A wonderful man who every teacher should aspire to emulate.", "HE WAS AN AWESOME TEACHER HE IS PASSIONATE IN WHAT HE TEACHES. HE LIKES DETAILS THOUGHS! BUT I WOULD TAKE HIM AGAIN HE IS AN AWESOME TEACHER", "not clear at all about subject/grading", "Has a deep sense of the material, and the wonderful ability to explain through examples. Very helpful.", "Todd makes learning algebra fun and I learned a lot from him. He always takes the time to help anyone who needs it, so they understand how you get from one step to the next.", "Summer on line class syllabus was long and confusing. His response to email ques., were even more confusing. Tests were impossible to prepare for and didn't cover material that went with assignments. . A lot of papers up to 6 per week, but easy. Class not paced well. Online set up disorganized! He didn't turn in grades on time to register.", "Hardest english course I've ever taken. The reading load is HEAVY you need Time Management skill or this class will be easy flunk. Lazy writers beware: You will be punished. Worked to the BONE for weeks to obtain a B. You'll learn a lot but if you already have a heavy course load i'd save this class for a term with easier classes. THIS IS HARD AF", "Entertaining", "Very helpful and understanding, medium skill set but ready to experiment with new trends in CS.", "Eierman is a great guy. He is extremely helpful at almost anytime of day. Exams and labs are kind of difficult, but he'll always answer questions. Good professor.", "Pretty easy class. A lot of the math-based problems are just plug and chug. Be careful with the conceptual stuff. Look at the notes he puts online, pay attention in class, do the homework, and you'll be just fine", "Easy professor. Just show up, do the easy 5 questions quizzes and free answer labs and you'll pass. Easy A.", "Best teacher ever. Take him if you can.", "Here's the thing; You are going to absolutely hate him for the entirety of his class. You are going to be bored from his rambling, irritated at his disrespect & frustrated at his teaching methods. However, at the end of the day he IS going to make you a better writer if you listen to him & pay heed to his criticisms. The pain was worth it.", "SUCH a great professor. Very helpful, funny, and interesting. Lectures might get a little boring some days, but for the most part the discussions were stimulating and thought provoking. Reading is pretty dense and heavy but he goes over it pretty clearly and answers all questions. Definitely turned out to be one of my favorite classes!", "Dr. Roter has a great sense of humor that he incorporates into his teaching. He gives an a properly balanced class of learning and smiles. He's great.", "wow is he hard, but very good", "\"One of the worst at JMSB Finance. Avoid at all costs. Random grading criteria (basically gives you a good grade if he knows you). If you insist on taking a class with him, focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get assignments/projects/exams right.\" From another review, but my thoughts exactly. Wow.", "He's probably the best professor I've had. He really cares about his students and really prides in his lectures. In addition, his lectures are all available online just for anyone to use. The assignments he gave were easy, all you really need to do is attend his classes and you're all set. Plus his stories are great. His final was easy. Take it!", "He has favorites in his class and he is not afraid to show them. He does spend more time on their questions.", "So boring! I had a hard time actually listening but it was a pretty simple class. I took at ITV so if I didnt get to take the test on blackboard I would have been ruined because the test are hard he uses every detail of his lecture in the book or not", "Ted is a great teacher and you really learn a lot in his class. His tests require a lot of studying but they aren't too bad. He gives many assignments but they are mostly interesting. Overall, Ted's lectures were usually interesting. Sometimes they were quite boring.", "I wasn't so interested in history until I took this professor. There is no reason not to pull off an A as long as you take good notes; his lecture notes are basically all from the book. The map test is really easy if you study, same goes for the midterm and final. Plus he has a great personality. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN.", "1 of the most frustrating experiences in my academic career.\r Lectures/study guides seem slight or opaque in regards to the assignments, which were disjointed in regards goals, if we were able to discern them.\r Feedback was critical w/o being constructive, & often irrelevant or inane.", "He is very smart and has a great teaching style. He teaches about interesting things that you would want to learn about! He is awesome!", "This guy is useless and arrogant. He converted a regular class into a blended one and kept assigning research papers for students to read, while he himself sits at home. He is never in his office. Most hilarious is that if you ask him something he doesn't know, he will tell you a long story about the work he did at Morgan Stanley 20 yrs ago.", "Easy class. Tests are online, so open book. Gives some of the essay questions ahead of time. Speak up in class once or twice and you will do great.", "Dr. Baker is by far the best instructor that I have ever had. He is very friendly, and he legitimately cares for his students. He helped us with the transition into the AEM program, and he is absolutely amazing. The midterm and final are both 20Q multiple choice, which take 10 minutes each. Attendance is 60% of your grade, so show up for class!", "Ok prof- he likes to talk about concepts instead of solving lots of problems in class, which helps with understanding but all the tests are only on the questions. You have to attend DGDs for that. But all past tests can be found online with answers and he seems to reuse the same questions every year so its not too hard to do well on his exams.", "He has you discover the chemistry. This has you understand why the rules are the way the rules are and understand why things work the way they do.", "Professor V. is a little boring and solely lectures the class and once in a while picks a person out to answer a question on the spot. However, he is very fair. He always rounds up. He definitely does not move too fast. Every class begins with a review of the last class.", "4 Projects. Miss a single criteria out of a list of 6-10? Max possible grade 66%. Test cases often all fail together, for reasons that are either very close to being, or are entirely arbitrary (showing a player piece on a board before they join) 4 projects, which you will often either get 100%, 66%, or 0%, and 3 tests are all that is graded/", "If youre thinking of taking Gutliph, do it! For an online class, he is extremely helpful and interacts with his students. He grades fairly, doesn't overload with too much homework, and prepares for tests. He is super helpful and has good taste in music as well which makes him all the more awesome. Take him, you will not regret it one bit.", "I don't know if he just hated me, but he destroyed my homework grade and hit a huge dent into my GPA. He docks HUGE points for simple mistakes, even if you arrive to the correct answer, so watch yourself.", "Dr. Baker is a great professor. AEM 121 was super easy compared to what I've heard about the other engineering intro courses.", "its kinda hard to get an a in his class", "Terrible professor. Insults students in class, makes students look stupid if they dont know an answer. would not recomend!", "He is a horrible teacher", "Ted - He's a legend. The man is hilarious and an amazing story teller. Struggled with his essays, but he was always willing to help. Got to that final ready to ace it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. He's great!", "Best professor I have ever had. This guy is AMAZING.", "Don't take James Naus as your TA, he sucks. Contrary to popular believe, his lectures are boring. You don't have to go to class. Just reading for the most part. Garaunteed B", "Best Class ever! I enjoyed the way Professor Jasek-Rysdahl taught the class. He made economics easy to understand. If you pay attention and do the study guide then you won't have trouble passing the exams.", "SO confusing! And the tests are excruciating. Likes to hear himself talk.", "DO NOT TAKE HIM! Papers every single friday on what we talked about in class. You have to fit every reading in the paper somewhere and theres at least 20 readings. Its awful. At least 6-7 reading for each class. Gives no help even if you ask. Tests are impossible! FIND A DIFFERENT TEACHER IF YOU ARE TAKING THIS CLASS!", "He can teach the material. Alright teacher over all. Attendance is optional, h/w is not graded nor collected, and grade comes from best grade of 3 out of 4 tests for 50%, and final for 50%.", "He's very rude and only wants to talk about how smart he is. It's like being in higschool because you have to show up and he yells if you need to leave early and freaks out if you whisper or your cell phone goes off.", "his class was a waste of my life. take someone else", "The single greatest teacher on the face of the Earth. The heavens opened up and deposited him in South Jersey of all places. The most important resource that New Jersey has, the east coast for that matter. Check that, the world! If you prick him he does not bleed, he is a demi-god of history.", "Great professor. Very good lecturer. Very fair grader.", "Very good teacher. Professor Walker is extremely knowledgeable on the subject. He makes you feel free to ask questions and offers clear explanations. With that said, the material is fairly tough. MC questions on tests can be tricky. Overall, I got a good grade but I have never studied that hard for tests in my life. Still he's a great teacher!", "Taking online class. Good teacher, nice and helpful. Organized and clear. Study the vocabulary and you're golden.", "THE BEST!!!!!!! He will soon start teaching A&P :)", "The hardest part about this class was sitting through the lectures. Just do the reading and the take home papers will be cake. Make lots of references to your reader and the handouts he gives you in class. Definitely skip as many lectures as your conscience will allow. So much potential wasted!", "He's a flippin moron", "Very Very Hard .His time is spent on learning to graph demand .Too many assignments and the final is really hard .Not recomended .", "He was awesome, just come to class and you will do fine the only reason a person would give him a bad grade is because they couldn't understand english... or didn't come to class. He was helpful fun and patience and very reasonable. Hell I wish my wife ha", "hE'S THE BEST!", "Had a bigger heart than any professor I've ever had. He'll be sadly missed.", "So boring and all he does is lecutre. Tests--Study FIFTY ID's, 10 will be on, and you pick 5 (each expected to be a page in blue book). Essay--study SEVEN, 3 will be on, you pick 1 (should be 3 pages)... If you guess Right, you'll be ok (aside from extreme hand pain), but he holds you accountable for insane amount of info.", "Fantastic professor. Loved his teaching. Took documentary survey from him. He opened my eyes to the art of docs, which I didn't understand before the class. He makes you write, so be prepared for probably 3-5 decent length papers. He will grade semi-tough but it's worth it. Some of the docs aren't the most interesting, but are valuable nonetheless.", "He tries constantly to not make the class boring or like basic book classes. He loves hearing student opinons because they give a different outlook to it. I recommend it to anyone especially if you don't like taking boring regular literature classes.", "Excellent teacher, very fun and knowledgeable about course material and give extremely fair tests for the midterm and final. I really cant say anything bad about him as a professor, if you get a chance to take classes with him you wont regret it.", "Just took the map test and got 100. One more test and one final. They are not cummutive", "I kinda like this professor. I can feel that he is trying so hard to make the students understand everything. The bad thing is, hes kinda short tempered. But he did it because he cares for his students. I'd take another courses with him in the future.", "The most incompetent and offensive A/H you will ever encounter in your life. Stay away from this professor, and you should have a rewarding college experience.", "Fred is the best! I have to disagree with whoever said he doesn't give stuff back, because I have gotten everything back very quickly in both of the classes I have him for! He is very laid back and is always willing to help if you ask! Easy A's for sure!", "took it in summer, physics is hard and he tries to make it as clear as he can. if you dont understand, ask questions. it's not something most people can just pick up, me included. he's helpful and funny too, good guy.", "I don't know where to start with this class. You sit in your chair and you bang your head against the wall for 75 minutes. Very boring and dull. Stecker is a nice guy and helpful, but the material he covers doesn't really help you. If you participate in lecture, you should be alright. The quizzes are misleading.", "great and fun to learn with!", "Mr. B is a very good speech professor. He understands most of his students hate public speaking but he just wants you to do your best. Some of his lectures are painfully boring but listening to someone talk about speaking tactics isn't fun anywhere. Show up for your speeches on time and you'll do fine!", "Online course, READ textbook, and you will be fine. Grades hard on papers, forum assignments are easy, but you must complete them.", "No Comments", "he is literally the worst teacher i've ever had... in my entire life.", "Just like all the rest of these reviews, I concur he is the best teacher ever. He makes Chemistry fun!! If you ever get the chance to take his class, do it. You will appreciate chemistry for the rest of your life. I took his class over 15 years ago. Amazing professor.", "This teacher is amazing!! he really kept me awake an taught me so much about life. If you like to debate you should take this class! i got a B only because i didn't study for the quizzes. Take home test an Final!! what more can a student ask for!!", "Prof. Williams, ahh, what a man! A truly unique individual in that you would never know what random thought would pop out during class. Sometimes difficult to discern what material was being covered in class and his explainations were sometimes as clear as mud . . . not always helpful during office hours, but at least he would try to help.", "Dr. Hupp was GREAT!!! He made the lectures fun and really interesting. Gives great examples in the notes. If you come to class and pay attention you will do fine. Exams usually have a few \"gimmes\"-easy points. I would definitely recommend his class!!!", "This is an easy pass class and Mike is a super nice guy. He is always trying to help people and is understanding. Just don't miss class because then you have to do the class work at home.", "Dave is a great teacher really got me into the subject of criminal justice and wanting to learn all i could.", "Spent most of class scratching his head, erasing and re-writing his code, and trying to remember syntax. His classes were a waste of time. He never prepared or updated himself.", "Jon is one of the best people I have ever met. His passion for theatre and his extreme knowledge and skill in theatre is very evident. Any class you take with him has a profound impact on you. But it's the times just working with him that you learn most.", "No Comments", "Allen Bell is a very nice man with a command for his subject. He is a brilliant writer and understands the film industry very well, which reflects on his teachings. He picks engaging movies and is fair with his marking.", "Professor Conti is equally impressive as an educator as he is a cool dude. He doesn't BS- BS probably isn't even in his vocabulary. Extremely down to earth but a tough grader. As long as you do literally everything he expects you too you will get at least an A-. He doesn't hand out A's easily but he is a fair grader.", "No Comments", "get past the rough exterior and a great prof shines through", "I absolutely love Dr. Milner. He is very passionate about teaching and learning. Class generally meets once a week with discussions and online tests, and there is nothing too difficult. If you want to be inspired, take this class!", "Took web class... great teacher and awesome class! HWs super easy (straight from book) and a few journals and DBs. No deadlines for HWs.

Take this class!!!", "No Comments", "great teacher great class great time!!!!!!!", "teacher is sooooo odd. weirdest teacher ive ever had.. makes funny faces and reacts oddly to fire drills...kinda freaky actually. i would avoid.", "This guy sucks at life. If your a math genius then you'll be fine. I got an A in college Algebra, but i had to drop his class. he is super strict on thing like, phones, behavor, and tarties. Blows by everything really fast. Will help u if u ask but still explains everything fast and makes you feel dumb and treats u like ur not trying in the class", "There's not much lecturing, mostly group-work, and a lot of self teaching. A lot of people don't like the way it's set up, but I don't mind it. Teaching this way forces students to actually LEARN the material, and it makes the final a lot easier. The class isn't easy, but it's not really supposed to be. Get to know the people in your group!!", "Ebert is a great teacher. Hard to pay attention to the lectures sometimes but he grades on a curve and offers extra credit. I missed the final day and didn't even call him till two days after. He took time out of his schedule to give me the test and I passed. Really nice guy and he's really enthusiastic about bio.", "This class is just hard, period. Physics is not my forte'. Mr. Dipert can come off as condescending and confusing but I've found if you approach him outside of class he is a different person. He tells you what to expect on quizzes and exams and leaves plenty of room to ask for help. If you do well on final and project, you'll pass.", "Kenney and Clark are a great pair. They're OK", "Daniel is helpful and caring. He really takes pride in the accomplishments of his students. Just for the record - you spell definitely - um - d-e-f-i-n-i-t-e-l-y. Just because we're in the visual arts doesn't mean we have to be illiterate.", "I took Frank for MRK 320. He's very knowledgeable about his field of work and can provide real life examples of marketing and sales theory in practice. He marks pretty leniently. If you do the work, you will get a good grade. He makes himself available via email or office hours. If you have him as an option for any course, don't hesitate. Take him.", "We had to study A LOT in this class. Don't take the class if you're looking for an easy A because you WILL fail. His tests are mostly T/F which I find harder than multiple choice questions. His teaching style is quite hard to follow, but you can tell he really has a passion for the subject. Our text is extremely helpful, so use it!", "Professor Stecker is one of the sweetest professors you could ever get. He loves the material, he cracks jokes, and he does a lot to help you out and also get to know you. As far as the class goes, he will assign a reading, read it before class to get the basis of knowledge and the next day he will go over it with you so you understand.", "McAuliffe is well-meaning man and a good scholar, but a ineffective teacher with a fatal penchant for uninteresting tangents. Our Love/Eros class was poorly planned and conducted in a slack, disoriented style. Until he gets this class together, seek guidance into this great reading somewhere else.", "This class was very interesting and you have a chance to learn a lot. I recommend this class for all Elementary Education majors.", "A nice guy with a dry and sarcastic sense of humor which I liked. He gives you the questions to the quizzes and tests beforehand so you can just do them on your own time with the textbook and then copy them down in class from your notes. Make sure you keep up with the journal questions. If you don't understan your grade he's helpful if you ask.", "The raw energy comment below is dead on. Steve can be a little much for the unprepared, but Sitting In A Room Listening To Steve 101 should be required for everyone on campus. Not a ceramics major, but would def. take him againfor anything", "I adore Irvine. Great lectures. He can even manage to make economics, the history lover's snore topic, fun! (Well, at least not terribly and dry and snore worthy.) I took his thrid year class too. All I have left to say is: Rrrrrrrusian Rrrrrrevolution.", "Very informative class. What I liked best was that the class work was NOT lecture-based. It was discussion, but also included dynamic, higher level learning activities. The course content is very useful for diverse classroom settings. The readings and issues brought up in the course are relevant. All viewpoints were encouraged and excepted.", "Very easy class. Makes it very interesting. Only 2 assignments. No book. 5 quizzes I think but are super easy. Don't really even have to come to pass.", "good guy, knows his stuff", "Professor Pyle is awesome. He's really relaxed in the classroom and tries to get people involved with his discussions. He's also willing to laugh at himself, and he realizes that people a long time ago forgot how to do that. But he still does. he's awesome!", "I had Caspi for Research and Child in the Community. I dont know what everyone is talking about. He is SO good! Compared to the other research profs, he doesnt give HUGE reports bc he honestly doesnt wanna have to sit and read b.s. fluff, WHICH IS AWESOME FOR US! People say he is a hard grader b/c people dont understand he just wants the facts. TA", "Terrible professor. Expected students to know information for tests that he didn't even teach about it. Awful grading system. I will never take a class with this professor again and advise no one else to either.", "This was a mini-course taken for HU credit but it honestly felt like 2 hours of the Amrine show. We never had ANY discussion and he just talked for two hours straight. I don't know why I kept going. Then the one paper that the grade was based on had 0 criteria laid out. No examples or anything. I had no idea what I was doing and paid the price.", "Wonderful teacher. He's the reason I majored in accounting.", "This guy is completely incompetent. Do not take any courses with him.", "He's the best!!! He gives 4 quizzes, midterm, final and two individual projects. Exams are not that hard as long as you study and do exactly what he tells you to do. He is an awesome teacher!!! 4 Quizzes will give you an idea what real exams look like. Take his class. You will have a great semester wit him!!!", "He is strict, and a definite pain in the butt and kind of a jerk. However, as long as you do what he says and get your work done, then you will get really good at Clarinet. His teaching method is like magic.", "Best professor I've ever had-period-. Class was demanding but interesting and when you get an A you know you've really earned it. Great guy personally, too. Take everything he offers, Denison doesn't have much else to offer!", "No Comments", "Really not bad a bad professor. He makes you work for it that's for sure. But he teaches students about controversial topics that are interesting to write about. The papers were cool to write about also. Just make sure to do all the online work, readings and follow the instructions for your papers and you'll do fine", "Awesome Teacher. Take it and go !", "I've had IxDA Seminar with Jason and he is a great professor and cares a lot about his students. Very techy guy & \"nerds out\" often (in a good way!) we took a lot of field trips & had many guest speakers/artists. Allowed us to see a variety of future paths in the IxDA field. he's mad into sound so take is classes", "Do not leave Harding without taking this man for at least one class. If you get the chance for an elective, I highly recommend his Civil War class. He's very passionate about what he teaches, and the field trip is great.", "Every professor should be like Professor Kozbelt. He was, hands down, my favorite teacher in college. I still miss his class one year later. Yes, stats is a challenging class, but for people going into this field and wishing to succeed, challenges need to be overcome. This teacher will fully equip you with what you need if you want to do well.", "difficult teacher, unless you're an advid writer do not take his class,He will not help you even if you ask for it,directions can at times be unclear,rude when you try to ask something, doesnt like being corrected even if you point a mistake out nicely,you can tell he is not inspired to teach anymore, dean refunded me right away without hesitation.", "He's an absolutely amazing professor and very fair. Take him if you can! I learned a lot.", "I loved evolution with Bro. Zenger. The subject matter itself is pretty easy. Just read from the text book, and discuss in class. There is a very large paper you have to write, which is a lot of work, but you get to choose what you write about, so that helps. Bro. Zenger is a great teacher and he cares deeply about his students.", "Very helpful with providing any additional help needed for this course!", "He is incredibly boring. We cannot pay attention in class because he can't keep it. We spend most of our time making fun of his receding hairline.", "He's great. Nice lectures alongside films related to the class. Take home midterm and final with some hw assignments inbetween. He won't make your semester a living hell and you'll learn a lot from his lectures and just speaking to him in general.", "As an IR major, I was required to take 3 econ classes. Of the 3 that I took, only one was even slightly educational--that was Intro to Micro with Visgilio. He is a straight shooter and is totally reasonable and fair. Great guy and professor!", "Loved the class, he made it enjoyable and fun. He was helpful and clear about his expectations and everyone knew what he expected from us.", "LOVED this class! I recommend it to EVERYONE with this prof! He teaches things beyond the textbook and has helped me with life skills.", "Most days he is 5-15 minutes late to class, then he sits down and reads off a powerpoint. Pay attention and take notes because this is a class where you do have to teach yourself most of it, it isn't uncommon for him to laugh at your questions and simply tell you it's easy and he already showed how. Even so, class is passable with effort.", "Steve is a great teacher! Very quirky, and he makes math (for those of us who don't LOVE it) a little more bearable. I work on campus and when he sees me he still says hi and remembers my name, even though it's been a few semesters. Take him if you have the chance!", "Phenomenal professor. Lectures were easy to listen to and fairly interesting even if geography isn't your favorite subject. Helpful guy. Test's and quizzes are all online and they are fair. Highly recommend Heywood if you want a nice grade in a 5 Credit course.", "A very intelligent man within his field of study. Not the best lecturer. He seems somewhat out of touch with the modern university system. He has an amusing tendency to glorify himself within his lectures.", "Funny guy, okay teacher, really easy class/tests - all multiple choice!", "Good professor but he will let you buy textbook that can't be sold back because it comes with access code. His tests are medium. IF you study, you will pass and get good grades. As simple as that. There's 2 tests, 2 movie reviews, extra credit movie review and final exams. He drops the lowest one grade final exam is not included. He is so-so.", "I had professor White for Comp Sci for AP Students. No textbook that I remember, labs are weekly but not overly difficult if you've had coding experience before. If you pay attention in class he will often describe how to do anything tricky in the lab and he's always willing to help if you ask.", "Very funny personality, talks like he doesn't care but as he get's more excited he sounds more angry, which makes learning programming really funny. If you are new to programming take his class! If you already know how to program TAKE HIS CLASS because if you finish the assignments you get guaranteed 80%, rest is the tests.", "You go to class to hear the same lecture worded differently. Discussions on (fairly easy) books simply touch the surface and nothing is in-depth. I think he's stupid although he acts like he's well-read and intelligent. I hope he gets fired. All you need to know is WL=lit read across the globe. I just saved you tons of $$ and time. You're welcome.", "Alexakos is one of the best teachers I've had at Santa Fe. I took Philosophy my first semester and failed. so i was dreading round 2. But he is so passionate about the material and so approachable in and out of class. The assignments and tests are easy and he loves to help with the 500 word essays assigned throughout the semester.", "You can get an easy B, if you read and complete the assignments on time and completely. He's a hard grader and the professor will grade based on how well you understood the readings and subjects for that designated assignment.", "Very hard class, not easy!! Expects you to know things that were never taught. Stay away!!", "AMAZING prof. One of the best I have had in a long time. Tries to connect everything to the students and encourages discussions in class. . Don't really need the textbook because he posts all the topics in his ppt slides, which is great. Readings are dry but if you go to the lectures, you don't have to do the readings, which is great.", "No Comments", "such a nice guy. i didn't do anything in the class and ended up with a b. it's not hard to do well and even if you screw up the tests, if you study for the final and do well on it you'll get a good grade. much better than beverly mitchell (from what i hear)", "He was a really good teacher, it could get boring but he let us out early alot and if you do all your work you should do fine.", "Sun needs a translator to teach in the US. He should take ESL himself before teaching others. I can still vaguely remember his incessant mumbling that maybe only he thought was actual language being spoken. Impossible to understand. He could have been speaking amazonian or latin for all we know.", "He knows what he's talking about and enjoys teaching his class. He has a somewhat rude manner but don't take it personally. I was intimidated to talk to him at first but when I finally did, he helped out a lot! Just pay attention, read and take good notes(:", "I absolutely loved this course. The textbook was great to read (most days a page turner) and Dr. Kinney taught directly from it. The tests were of no big surprise and I learned a lot. It was great having the opportunity to scratch out five questions we did not want graded on all of our tests...boosts the grade. I would absolutely recommend taking i", "My worst grade for a course so far in university. I think it's the annoying overuse of textbook material that makes the class hard. It's very frustrating when all of your marks come from exams (based only on textbook material), and there are no assignments or lab work. His slideshow notes are terrible - they contain only words and no explanations.", "No Comments", "Easy going nice guy but class was really boring he lectures the whole time and its hard to stay interested. Plus the subject is very difficult. Lots of homework reading and test. Don't reccomend for a general requirement class", "How can you not love a prof who will call shoddy work \"Barfy\" or, my personal favorite, \"Barfarific\"? He knows his stuff and if you follow his advice you'll learn a lot.", "He's probably my favorite professor at SCAD! He knows what he is talking about and is very helpful and is great with his critiques. He tells lots of stories, sometimes they're relevant, sometimes not. I would definitely take his class again!", "Mr. Filson is a very kind and understanding professor. It is not the easiest class, but if you work hard to understand what he is saying, you will get a good grade. Before the tests, he gives answers to the study guide, which really helps understand what will be on the test. I would love to take another one of his classes and highly recommend him!", "Pretty laid back", "His lectures can get boring, but you dont really have to show up.I would recomend it since on all 3 exams he had questions regarding his opinion on a certain subject. The tests require a lot of reading and understanding of concepts covered in the text. Even though his lectures are boring he would make the class laugh at almost every lecture.", "No Comments", "Amazingly intelligent. He lectures from memory and knows something about pretty much everything. His course was truly fascinating. Only problem is that he made his exams years ago, and doesn't change them to what he actually taught this year, but in the end hes an easy grader and weighs the percents of each piece of your grade in your favor.", "Huddle is laid back, good sense of humor, but beware- in this class at least, 75% of your grade is pop-quizzes on the readings. They're easy, but you have to do the readings. Also, class can get a bit dull (you read out loud a LOT), but is mostly easy and a good excuse to just read the books.", "Senior Seminar is over the top as far as assignments go - it's total chaos. Overall, though, he's a good professor and he's very reasonable when it comes to grading. If you've met the requirements and you've demonstrated that you've done the work, you'll do fine. He's also a good advisor if you're a journalism student.", "I'm a junior and a I took him during my first semester at BC. His class is still the only class in my LIFE that I've gotten a C in. His exams have nothing to do with the textbook, and his lectures are not coherent. I'm writing this review because I want to make sure other students don't make the same mistake I did. DON'T TAKE HIM!", "marks easy in first year courses but in second and third year such as cart and geomorph he expects a great deal more although if you go to class and study high marks are quite possible", "really good teacher, loves philo, dark humor", "he is the GREATEST teacher he has such a passion for teaching! Cumberland county stinks for not hiring him, I am taking my dads money else where! P.S. he has a nice arse. I wanna touch it", "One of the easiest classes at mcp as of yet for me.. 100% would take him again if I could! I cannot recommend him enough. Study the slides and you'll do great on the exams (all MC). Extremely easy A. Lab is also much easier than freshman bio labs!", "Awesome teacher! He does whatever it takes to help you succeed.", "GREAT Teacher. HARD class. I don't recommend missing class - it will kill you", "Actually really good. Course policies are incredibly clear. Strict (a good thing, in my opinion) but fair. Homeworks are challenging but rewarding. There is never any ambiguity here, which is a good thing.", "One of the better teachers in the school. Very willing to help and can explain things in different ways. Large amount of busy work, but tests are basically given from past tests which he posts. Also very funny and acts like just one of the guys.", "Prof Strong is an okay professor. I found his lectures unclear/confusing. I basically taught myself by reading the chapters, going over the ppts, and creating my own study guides. His tests are tough, study everything!! If you ask for help, he is willing to help though. Lab practicals are easy if you study and go to the tutoring center.", "Not for slackers. Gives you all the information that you need and expects you to learn it. One of the craziest senses of humor on the faculty. Take his class but be prepared to pull your weight.", "This man makes you NOT want to be an EM major. This class seems to drag on for hours at a time and if it weren't required to be there I would skip a lot. Material is outdated, irrelevant, and not useful to the current world.

His exams are difficult and often contain vague information that he only mentioned briefly in class. If you get any aspect of the problem wrong, don't expect partial credit. He's super clear in lectures, but you have to work really hard for a good grade.", "Even though I hate science of any sort, I was still able to admire Prof. Bowman for his intelligence and apparent concern for us. However, when I dropped his class, and saw him in the hall about 3 weeks later, my friendly smile and \"hello\" was met with his rude glare and rolling of the eyes. Admirat", "Wonderful! Incredibly unique teaching method; much more enjoyable than the standard teacher-student style. His class was the highlight of my week. He is INCREDIBLY knowledgable about the human mind and emotions-quite possibly the most intelligent prof on campus. I changed my major to psychology too!", "i have had him for 2 classes now.

Does not teach anything, just hands out assignment sheets and gives too much time in class to work.

Rude to students and anyone elses view that differs from his is wrong.", "If you don't go to class you wont pass at all. YOU CANNOT MISS ONE CLASS. He leaves blanks in his power-points and you are only able to find the answers in class. At the end of the class he does not re-post the power-points with the missing words, so you are unable to study off of them if you miss a class. And there is no textbook to look at. DONT.", "He is a kind instructor. He sometimes goes off topic with his notes since he writes them as we go along in class so no class have the same exact notes. The material is hard but he teaches it well. Watch out for his exams. There is a ton of material covered and you get about 50 min to complete. Pace yourself or you will run out of time.", "He trys to be entertaining. The class is boring. The tests are hard. If you take this class be ready to study your butt off cause the tests cover like 150 pages+ each.", "He's very intelligent and knows what he's talking about because he's done fieldwork in the past.

It is also hat to read to the board.", "No Comments", "One of the worst profs I've ever had. Lectures were a joke. Most question that he tests you with are questions that really that dont have anything to do with the concepts studied in his sellout. It seems he just wants to know if you've read it, not if you understand it. Thumbs down", "Good prof and a funny guy. His lectures can run a bit long, but his sense of humor and tangents keeps them interesting. 99% of what you do in class translates exactly to the tests. He also makes accommodations for the way the online HW works, so getting the grade there isn't too hard. Just makes sure you don't underestimate his tests and do well.", "Prof. Curtis is one of my favorite professors I've ever taken...I had his class 8:15 in the morning, but it was the best. No textbook, no mid-term or final just a 1 pg paper every week pertaining to drug/alcohol, and a final paper 6-8 pgs. One of the funniest people I've ever met. Def recommend him you will have a lot of fun...I guarantee it.", "I ended up having to use notes from other Canadian lit. classes just to understand what was going on in lecture.

Rude to the students and just a huge jerk. I would never, EVER, take another class with him again. EVER.", "This man is to smart for community college.

Never taking his class again.", "He's a great guy and the tests are very easy, he's willing to help you out alot!", "Very unique class format, as we do the talking instead of him. It's more of us self-learning, with Splane as the one overseeing things. Big perk about this course is that the textbook is online, so it's practically clear cut. Mac users will have slight issues, but it can be worked around. If Mike's available to teach, then take his class!", "Dr Frank Mitchell is hands down the best instructor I've ever had the pleasure of learning from.

I would do a few quizzes a week and reviewed those for the final and passed. Turn the Journals in on time they are a great portion of your points. Very self paced, relaxed class!", "Super easy A+! Nice guy!", "Pretty easy and a pretty funny professor. The tests are easy as long as you study. Don't make it hard on yourself. The word exams are easy A's as well.", "Professor Pratt is great.

You never feel intimidated to ask a question and he never gives you attitude for asking questions in person as opposed to in front of the class.", "entertaining, disorganized presentation, vague, always late, expectations unclea", "A very subtle and humble man. You can just tell he has so much wisdom and perspective by the way that he approaches life. His class is fun, educational, and even therapeutic in some level", "This guy doesn't give any feedback related to the writing process.

The MLA was checked by professionals and my views are simply that, my views. Gives incompletes if you don't label exactly how he said regardless writing", "Great professor! The key to getting a good grade in this class is really just paying attention to his lectures, taking good notes, and studying. He makes all the neuroscience material understandable with the way he explains things. He also always provides real-life examples relating to the lecture and they're enjoyable to listen to bc he's funny.", "The best professor at gsu", "Very very specific about what he wants out of your assignments. Needs you to pander to his own views to do well in the class, leaving not much room for originality and outside perspectives.", "In his ethics class he really pushes peoples buttons to spur discussion.

His voice is monotone so it's easy to tune out but, he always takes the time to explain everything.

He also gives tricks to remember the material.", "Good teacher. Explains the concepts clearly. He is very helpful with the homeworks. Best class this semester!", "This guy knows his stuff for sure, but this class is very hard.

He will pick on you, but usually its because you didn't do your work. Overall, be prepared to do a lot of work, but you will actually learn something,", "Nice man, but the material was just too hard. He was such a mathematical genius that he couldn't find a way to teach it to idiots like me who only took it for requirements. Recommend Basic Math for those who can't do math real good.", "All I can say is, do not take this class. I had to complain to the department about this professor and the course. If Blackboard shuts down the student suffers. The quizes and 150 word essays are graded unfairly. The professor is the worst. I am far from lazy or stupid. Eventually I dropped it to protect my GPA.", "Terrible professor. His lecture slides are random quotes pasted from a journal abstract, and to learn anything you need to read all the journals. Is it laziness? probably. If you like reading 10 journals per lecture, leaving more confused after asking him a question or being stood up at his office hours take a course with mccarthy", "pretty nice guy, very opinionated but he hears out everyone and is pretty reasonable. knows his stuff and the class discussions are pretty good. If you know the material you'll do fine.", "EASY class. He is the only sociology teacher with this easy of a class. I loved it! He is great. You have to read the books but they are actual books not text books. This class is so simple it's not even funny.", "No Comments", "Good proof gets straight to the point. Know what he s talking about", "Very hard material! Very knowledgable", "This guy knows his stuff. Just make sure you get things handed in on time.", "IPE, hard class, but man I learned a lot by the end of the semester. Great guy too!", "Madden is a great teacher and funny too; but your grade depends on your TA b/c they give all the assigenments and grade everything...my T.A. SUCKED, so this class sucked no matter how much i liked the lectures. be sure you talk to people are make sure you get a good T.A.!!!", "This is my second quarter with Hyde. His class is easy, but heavy on lectures. There are no tests and the only assignments are weekly discussion posts and a final paper. Its pretty easy, and an interesting class.", "Without Dr. Dukes, I would not be a researcher today. Before taking him, I was scared of what he taught... Now I do it for a very good living. Thank you Dr. Dukes!!!", "Jim is a really nice and helpful, teacher. If you need help on the homework or an extension for a week or so, he will definitely let have your time with the assignments. Really enjoyed being in his class. Highly recommended.", "Craig is an amazing teacher, probably my favorite and I do not like science classes. He's quirky and a little weird at first but you will love him by the end, he's hilarious. Do not take bio 103/104 if you do not like going outside because that is all you do. If you do like going outside, it's an easy A. No homework except to read. Study for tests.", "Get ready to step outside your comfort zone and open your mind to learn new ways of seeing things. He allows you to test out ideas and theories through writing. If you are a good writer on top of that, you will ace the class and enjoy it immensely. However, the minute you close your mind is the minute you have set yourself up to fail this class.", "really nice guy. Class kind of drags on, but he does frequently let you out early. Tough grader on papers. You should easily get a B- in his class.", "professor scherb goes by the slideshows really fast and his tests are hard. you would have to work really hard in order to pass the class and he puts the lectures on blackboard. choose another professor if you can!", "Interesting class, lots of notes but you can print powerpoint off blackboard and take it to class. tests and paper were easy but final was difficult. if you miss one class, you miss a lot. i would definatley reccomend this class.", "Great teacher, knows his stuff and knows how to teach. People who complain are the ones who did not try and were playing games on their laptops in class.", "Memorizes every students name; knows exactly where he stopped lecture last time. Fast turnaround on tests and hmwk. Fast response to email. Textbook and lecture note combo: $5. One 5 question M/C Bb quiz with 48 hr window, per wk. Prior to hmwk due dates, willing to check it and show you where to make corrections. Sample tests provided on Bbb.", "Professor Matheson is an extremely nice man, but makes no sense whatsoever. Because his lectures were so hard to follow most of the class was left reading the textbook, going to the Physics lab, and studying in large groups for hours upon hours.", "Dr. S is def awesome. He is so helpful with everything and is more than willing to go out of his way to help his students!", "Late to the start of class 60 - 70% of time. Often runs class late as much as 20 minutes. 95% of class time is reading powerpoint slides. Very little insight compared to reading the textbook. Assignments are poorly structured.", "Dr. Hadley can be an aquired taste. A lot of what he says, he doesn't mean, all you have to do to get decent grades in his class is do do your homework and participate. And he's right though, as a generation we know a lot about technology but not a lot about world affairs.", "He thinks he is a dictator, and is going to take over the world. He looks down upon his students like they are nothing. Don't take CRJ425 with him take it with Prof. Sung, he is much better.", "DO NOT TAKE HIM! He does not speak about psychology of personality. He speaks mostly on Statistics but what does stats have to do with this class? He keeps on repeating what he says and stays on one chapter almost for a month. His textbook does not make sense as well. Terrible professor.", "Get past the Elmer Fudd accent and you'll find one of the best teachers Wes has to offer. Truly loves his subject and communicates his enthusiasm to his students.", "The class is easy and interesting, however i found the online format hard to follow", "Paul picks favorites. Paul has his own agenda. Paul has his own agenda for what you should do with yourself. Be careful, especially if you end up being a favorite. Some say he lives vicariously through the work of his students. All I'm gonna say is that he has an agenda - for you and for your work.", "yippee for lippy. i loved the class. most teachers are shy about saying what they think and making their views the centerpiece, but dr. lippy told us where he stood and even tried to talk us into agreeing with him. i respect that.", "Ok, this teacher was extremely not helpful at all. His powerpoint lectures provided would always have mistakes in them confusing the students on how to work the problem correctly. Teacher was easy to get a hold of but if you got a problem wrong because of his error. Tough Luck...", "Boring class... Felt like I did not learn much. Hard grader when it comes to papers. Expects us to be knowledgeable reporters who know their stuff when we never been reporters in our lives. Too much expectation. Made it difficult. Not that good of a teacher. Very tough!", "Duane is a great professor and role model. The work 4 the class is ALOT but U should already know that coming in2 any SOFD 328 class. He loves his job which reflects his passion for the class. Lots of busy work but nothing 2 major. Very eye opening course you will take with you for the rest of your teaching career! EMU should be proud 2 have him!", "Took the trickster and arabian nights courses while back. the prof was horrible. he does not know how to relate to other people. he marked us way too hard and made us read way to much. he borrowed money from students! and he totally played favourites.", "great teacher, his class is interesting, watch many videos, lets class out early a lot, very sweet.", "WORST.PROFESSOR. EVER!!! He was so boring, he didn't listen to students, and if anyone talked in class, he put them down. If you went to his office hours, he's always late and he won't respect your point of view - he will argue with you and make you think you're wrong.", "Camilo can be hard to understand with his accent and some of his assignments aren't very clear cut. The class can be tough at times, and he's a stickler for doing things his way. However i think he's an amazing person. The class might've been hard but I'm glad I took it with him", "you actually have to know the subject to do well in this class, which frustrates most people. be prepared to LEARN about fluid flow, heat transfer, etc. and not just how to plug-n-chug", "Irvine was easily my favourite professor this year. The workload is not easy, but it's manageable if you put in the time. He's so funny, and seems very approachable. Doesn't seem to be arrogant like other professors I've seen. Exam was very fair and much easier than expected. Not a hard class if you're willing to put in the work, which most aren't.", "Very organized and always prepared for each lecture. Gives crystal clear explanations of slides and definitions during lectures. Tough but fair grader. The semester isn't even half over, and I consider him one of my favorite profs I've had. Take Breiner!!", "Very strange, but if you get on his good side, you'll prosper in the class. You have to write like him in order to make a good grade. Tests are relatively easy, while papers have to be dead-on accurate....", "such a boring teacher, literally reads off the notes he gives to the class for the whole class in the corner of the room. Hope he gets canned", "hard class, busted my balls all semester", "One of the best math professors...Not only is he really intelligent but also really funny! Let's face it, integration is not most people's definition of a good time - but I absolutely loved the class!", "Gendron is amazing. I can't say enough good things about him. He's a fair grader, and really makes class interesting.", "Very helpful and outgoing. Tests aren't difficult if you actually do the reading and note taking. I will take every class i can with Dr. Grover.", "He's a great guy, and pretty funny in class. He's ALWAYS late, which is no big, just go to class and listen when he talks, you'll be fine. It may be a little bit boring, but he'll tell you that at the beginning.", "Expect to lose points for the most trivial things. Extra output, incorrectly formatted output; lose a third of the credit on the project, or more. Tests are open book and notes, but if you don't have EXACTLY the right answer he's going to take away points. Lectures are monotone and will put you to sleep. Avoid at all costs.", "Good professor. Had a lot of group work. That is all the class is. You need to teach yourself because he will not lecture. He will emphisise main points in your PowerPoint presentations. Crazy ass curve for midterms/exams. No quizes at all. Particiation is a must. Uses WebCT for that. Labs were fun and easy credit.", "This prof. is not that bad but the ALEKS and comp assignments is what kills u. The thing i didn't like about this prof was how he allowed everyone to get up and try to explain the subject and he just sat there.Oh yeah, if he knows your name he will pick on you.If ur the type of person that doen't like doing HW i wouldn't recommend him.", "I must say he has been one of hardest educators I've ever experienced. The textbook he co-wrote is like reading another language and never learning that new language. He will definitely ruin your GPA. He is of no help and cares less if you learn or not. Students are unable to do well on the discussion boards & on quizzes even worst. Never take him!", "Professor Travisano was and I presume still is second to none.", "HE's one awsome teacher!!!", "Bob was an amazing teacher. Read the chapters before hand and you'll understand what he is talking about in class. His tests are not bad if u do the reading. He is a very wise and brilliant professor and should be repected. Those who want to talk bad about him should try doing the work before they are going to blame their misfortunes on Bob!!!", "Excellent instructor. Very helpful and interesting. If you put some effort into the class (ie. attend, do the homework) you'll do fine. He wants people to do well. If you are a slacker, be prepared to be stressed with the workload. I also recommend the fieldtrips class (for an activity credit); it gives a new appreciation of geology.", "Too boring", "Absolutely phenomenal professor. He is extremely passionate about what he teaches, and is dedicated to helping you receive the best mark possible. That being said, do not expect a bird course by any means. Quizzes are frequent and rigorous, and you can expect to be diving into Kanji by the end of your first semester.", "Amazing angel of a professor. Dr. Kozbelt is an interesting professor, his lectures are clear and concise and he is very understanding and reasonable, even in a graduate level class. Take him!", "Don't listen to the bad reviews. Tudor really is the best teacher for Cells/Genetics. He is a very nice guy and very approachable which MANY of the bio professors at SJU aren't. The tests/quizzes and everything else are run by the bio dept not the individual teachers so they are the same in all the sections. Tudor's the best of them by far.", "Great teacher, funny guy, and his workbook helps so much. Everyone who takes Olsen regrets it. Take Walker, NOT Olsen. Great class and pretty easy to get a good grade if you put in the time doing practice problems and practice tests in his workbook.", "I was very uneasy as to how grading will be and I cannot lie, waiting for my grade made me very anxious. As a professor, def not the best. As an advisor, he is phenomenal and keeps things real. Unless you're ready to be fully engaged I would avoid taking him but he is great to talk to!", "great teacher...just different teaching tactics", "He's all over the place, you leave most classes feeling like you didn't learn anything at all. Since attendance isn't mandatory it makes you not want to waste your time and stay home, he's nice though so not a tough grader.", "No Comments", "Dr. Armstrong is favorable to the students that are in the St. Olaf Choir. If you are not in choir, expect to get a lower grade. Plain and simple. Also, I don't feel that I learned as much as I could have because Dr. Armstrong was so busy telling the class anecdotes of how he's influenced people instead of actually teaching.", "Go to his office hrs he likes to know his students Before all of his tests he gives study guides but his tests are hard and not all the info on the test comes from the study guide so make sure you use your book for reference 3-4 papers(3pgs min) are assigned analyzing newspaper articles.", "Dr. Bob is an amazing instructor! His lectures are beyond amazing and so enjoyable. I took both is Psych classes my first year at Highline and I absolutely do not regret anything. He's very organized too! Make sure to do those readings and study those before an exam! There are no secrets! Just read, memorize and study! DO THE 1 PT BONUSES!!!", "Superior teaching style, much of the way I teach now is allotted to him.", "He is a great teacher do not get me wrong, but he is teaching format is for students who clearly grasp the concept of math! i am terrible at math and i did terrible in this class! DO ALL HOMEWORKS! ATTEND ALL CLASSES! If you are good at math i advise you take this class because it may be easier for you.", "He does a good job teaching Photoshop and will give input when asked. He does take role and you must attend the lab to turn in your photos.", "One of my favourite professors at Guelph. He truly makes lectures enjoyable to attend. I believe he is an extremely fair marker and creates good exams, but his classes are not easy.", "AWESOME! this guy is a good teacher. explains everything clearly and hes VERY nice. tests are hard though so make sure u pay attention during class. take him, hes good", "Dr. Paulsen is a very easy to talk to, with a great sense of humor. The course itself was not that great, but I liked Dr. Paulsen a lot.", "This guy is VERY hot. He is a great teacher and ALWAYS makes class fun. I would also recomend you take this mans class!", "Slack! Tests are 50 question, multiple choice. The notes are emailed, and all you have to do is take a few notes on what he says here and there, like stories or examples. He's cool. Easy A.", "Overall a good prof. He tends to be monotonous and is somewhat hard on marking. However, he is very intelligent, his notes are very good and he is very helpful to students. Make sure to study his notes for exams.", "He slaps overheads up and talks for hours on end. Too fast to write down.", "i dont know what these other reviews are talking about! this guy SUCKS!!!! mid term, final and presentation. tests are SO hard trust me, im a smart guy. at least you can use the computer all class though", "No Comments", "Fey has a funny and sarcastic sense of humor and loves to blend it in. Very knowledgable about economics. Class seems dull at times and boring. The class was a bit difficult, but i think its more about the curiculum more than anything else.", "agree, has expectations of advanced painting for beginners class. doesn't like things painted in pastels. Likes a specific style of painting. if you arent satisfied with a grade he gives you a chance to improve your painting, thats nice.", "Dr. Wiseman is very strict and has no patience for students that have families. He does not make try and meet the needs of a student that is going through a hard time. And also as well, he does not narrow down what to study before an exam.", "John Burton is by far the best professor I have had at this college. I plan to ask him to be my adviser, and because of his teaching I have decided to major in Anthropology. He supplements his class with his own studies and so he is a master of the material. If you want an easy class that will expand your mind give it a try!", "Talks very fast and teaches right off of the powerpoints from the book's website. If you read the powerpoints and do practice problems from the book, you should be okay. So if you don't like going to class but like getting good/okay grades, this is the class to take", "Half of class was spent with him humble bragging about how marvelous himself and his achievements are and the other half was spent with him explaining his unclear prompts in the most obscure way possible. He's a tough grader with high expectations so to office hours and get feedback on drafts before turning in your final paper and you should do ok.", "Ridiculous - lectured as if we had a phd in bio - has to be the worst teacher I've ever had", "Prof Douglass is one of a kind. I guess when you sign up for the class it says it's strictly a lecture. Must have missed the memo. The most boring class I've ever taken though. If you like to listen to a monotone voiced man speak for an hour straight then go for it. He does not use blackboard or handouts either. Only six grades for the semester.", "Enomoto is the nicest teacher of all time. He is very chill and does not yell. He also explains thing very well!", "he is nice, but only the problem is he does not teach, and everybody is bored in class.", "Good guy, just kind of has dull lectures. Worth going to class though, when attendance drops he will announce a pop quiz. Your question will usually be \"Please recall your name\", and you turn in your name. Very lenient with homework as well.", "I loved his lecture style! It's frustrating when professors put up slides and expect you to just copy them down while talking fast. Dr. Talham put slides up AND wrote items down on the board AND explained as he went. Lots of great visual aids in class. He made a note to learn every student's name in class during Summer A. Kind guy, great lecturer", "if you are a full time student, good luck because this prof gives a ton of work as if this is the only class we are taking, asks for too much detail, and VERY picky with assignments and writing. if you can, save yourself and avoid it! also many students complained about this prof outside this website so, that should def be a sign!", "Ed is very helpful and is always trying to better his classes. Although this class reiterates principles of design, it puts them in a very subjective light. Dont be afraid to have very strong opinions, but also dont be afraid to listen to other people's arguements. This is a very interactive class", "Great teacher.", "No Comments", "Prof Czajkowski is the only prof for this course and is the best. He can be intimidating, but he is hilarious. His marking is really fair such that you will not be able to fail his class unless you put in no work. The final was multiple choice which was good. Midterms were quite hard but he gives many opportunities to bring your mark up.", "AWESOME PROFESSOR!!!!!!! you will learn in this class and you well love his class. midterms and finals are take homes", "This guy doesn't care much about teaching. I could just go on and say the same thing everyone else did, but I won't. He has accomplished alot in his life and now he's making money on the side for talking about it to a class. I learned nothing for this class, although I was happy with my grade. I've never had a teacher cancel so many classes.", "Mr.McDonald is a wonderful teacher. He is such a pleasure to be around. He has a way of making algebra make sense. He is by far one of my favorite teachers in all my years of school.", "The class is a handful of small lab reports that can be graded tough, lab notebook checks, and participation. The participation grade can save you. He is very sweet, wants to help, and is very considerate. He is incredibly intelligent so sometimes his lectures are over student's heads.", "No Comments", "One word: COOL!!!", "Confusing, unclear, kind of all over the place.", "You can tell he loves the material, and it is boring sometimes, but this class was definitely really cool. He made the tests SO EASY, you get a cheat sheet for every one, so theres no way to NOT get a good mark. He takes test material right out of the book and only does more challenging math on assignments, which he will help you do if you ask.", "Can't say anything negative about this guy. He cares about helping students learn and it shows, just look at all his teaching awards.", "Ware is the worst teacher I have ever encountered. At a Master's level I think everyone is aware how to site a paper. He spends too much time talking about about his accomplishments and how much he has been discriminated against. Grow up and talk about the subject matter!", "I have never thought of sociology as of subject of my interest. Since I started attending his class it seemed that this semester flew in one second. Bottom line: class is awesome, written assignments aren't hard at all, rather intriguing and challenging in a positive way. It is not likely that you regret if you take it.", "No joke, I developed a crush on him because he was so passionate about his work, his students and the environment. AWESOME GUY! Wow. I actually miss attending his lectures...", "AMAZING PROFESSOR!!! His expertise within the subject matter is beyond this world! He lectures only for 1.5 hrs and the rest of the 3 hour lecture he allows for group work. His teaching method is nothing that you will expect, but even though he relies on a lot of independent studying and research it pays off! This method is very effective.", "Was very unprofessional during group presentations as he often always interrupts speakers in the middle of their presentation and would even answer his own questions in the end without waiting for class discussions. Quizzes and midterm are an easy 100% even if you've just skimmed the chapters and read his slides beforehand.", "no choice if you want hebrew. He is the only hebrew language professor. Anything you don't know on the tests, just ask. He will tell you straight out. one time i asked an answer straight, he told me the answer, the 2 before, and the 2 after without my asking.", "This is a difficult class with a very difficult professor. He tends to get defensive and a little condescending when asked a question. He doesn't grade on a curve and almost everyone in the class was failing. You really do need to attend class regularly and be disciplined enough to do the homework if you want to get a C- or better.", "Easy class. Sweet professor. No studying necessary.", "Fred is one of the best math teachers I have taken. He is always willing to help. I passed this class because of him. However, make sure you show up to class and don't miss a test!", "I had Prof Smith back in 1994. Although we had different opinions politically, and they were discussed at length in class, he was one of my favorites. The way he conducted himself and the class was wonderful.", "dr wilson is interesting.. he talks to himself a lot and his lectures are boring but if you show up its super easy. you can turn in hw whenever and all tests are take home tests! the final is super easy and you practically do it in groups.", "Ichy was a great prof. I still remember day one of COMA123. A solid educator and a good guy. Heh. \"housekeeping.\" That word just popped back into my head. (Maybe we can raise $20 million and send him up to the space station so he can see that the earth is round.)", "don't buy the book! you don't need it. take good notes and save about $180!", "Awesome Professor! He is Hilarious! Great class for night students because he keeps things interesting. He definitely shows his bias on everything and wants you to agree. But he's a politician. What do you expect?? 3 exams-multiple choice, no graded homework. USE THE STUDY GUIDES AND YOU WILL GET AN \"A\"!! GUARANTEED. Support Edgerton's Revolution!!", "This class requires the teacher to help create your preception of art, form and design. Ed does this wonderfully and you'll find yourself wanting to have a conversation with him.", "I really enjoyed Professor Harding's class. He's really funny and easy going. There are only 2 exams (midterm & final) from what I can remember and they're both take home. There is one presentation but it is with a partner and its super easy. He has one short paper 3-4 pages and one long paper 5-7 pages. This is an easy class to get a WI credit.", "Very clear and helpful. Gives homework answers daily to check work. Very applicable teaching style", "no need to go to class, tests are take home... they are tricky though, so take your time. my major is criminal justice and learned NOTHING. haha", "Awesome teacher. Took him both semesters! Knows his stuff & likes the material. Bio is work but I would take him again in a heartbeat. Always posts his lectures & really wants you to learn & love bio as much as he does! Highly reccomended!!", "Best professor I had in college. He was my professor in the 1970's and 80's. Changed my life by encouraging critical thinking and creative ideas.", "No Comments", "I could not seem to get an A with this guy on any of my papers. I think its because I went against all of his personal beliefs. He is kind of creepy and you will not be able to stay awake during his class. Don't bother studying for the quizzes because he tries to trick you anyways. I never did open the book and i ended up with a B.", "While he may know what he is talking about, he talks for so long and brings in so many random references to the lectures (such as star trek or his daughter) that the important parts become unclear. There are only 3 exams for the semester and these are your only grades, so be sure to attend the SI and TA sessions before each exam.", "I took his class a few years ago and I really liked him! He seems like a genuinely nice person and he has a really funny sense of humor. I recommend his class!", "If you havent took SPH 131, this is the professor you need in your life! Professor Betts is super funny but very professional. He creates such a comforting environment in his class that makes it so much easier for speech days. He tells you want he expects & gives clear instructions for every speech, (4 +1 group speech) and also for the tests (2).", "Great professor, explains everything with clarity. Literally what he talks about in class that's on the test. I would take him again.", "Very funny and easy teacher. Was willing to work with you on problems. Quizzes are easy even if you don't read the book beforehand. Doesn't restrict project ideas (He let a guy make an add for a wife remote and lots about guns and explosives). Very helpful and knows what he is talking about.", "Definitely take physics from him, he actually cares about the students and does everything he can to make sure you learn. He also cares about your grade so he doesn't punish you for not knowing how to do everything and gives you several chances to learn. The tests aren't hard just study and do the homework and you'll get a good grade", "I'm not a fan. The free-willed nature of the professor is liberating, and for that I commend. However, that strength is the seed of his destruction. He offers hardly any challenge for the course, and is evident he isn't taking it seriously. You're better off with other professors.", "Dennis is a wonderful professor, wouldn't you agree? I love how he sets up his methods classes for open discussion and felt that it as a good way of understanding the concepts as well as his and my peers views and in turn made me think about mhow I would use those concepts in my own teaching. I too also like Mastery learning making sure the concepts are learned correctly, like in conducting. That is a vital skill for all teachers and is best that it can be done over until it is done right. HARD and SHORT!", "my favorite professor so far. he may have changed my attitude towards life. if you're a christian, he might convert you to something else.", "love this teacher. he is so awesome and very very very helpful. I know he's reading this right now. I know you are because this is his cp's homepage!! hahahaha..", "Hal Blythe is a very good teacher and he is actually interested in his students, not just his job.", "He's a nice guy, but very boring lectures. I have zoned out so many times. Tests are pretty tough. He does give you a study guide though. Lecture every class. Quizzes on short books and tests over a few weeks of material.", "His class is VERY boring and I'm learning nothing I haven't learned in the past. He never answers questions after class, or even during class. He lectures the whole time, and his attitude changes when a \"special\" person is in the class.", "Im TERRIFIED of public speaking and after this class i cannot say I am less so, but Mr.B is a caring prof who really wants you to do well! The comments saying to just try aren't wrong, he's an easy grader and I should have gotten a B cause of my exam scores but ended up with an A anyways? Also happened to a friend of mine. Just try and you'll pass.", "i can't say, he is a good prof. because he gives dood results( A or A+) to his fevorite students only.", "Dr. Krieglstein is a great Prof. He grades based on your true desire to learn and the effort you put into understanding the material. He assigns a paper based on topics found in one of his books and assigns journal entries based on reading material and movies in class. Deep and profound class that may change how you live your life.", "Um...Did someone say Retirement? Because thats exactly what he needs to do. I'm sure he use to be a great professor. He doesn't explain anything. Needs to realize somethings just can be elaborated on. Class has potential. Discussions were OK.But overall I think its probably my worst class yet here at EMU.Be weary of this class if you dare take it.", "Dr. Burns has been in the Rawls since the building was erected. His class can be dry at times, but you learn what you need to for your future careers. He had a TA that graded our project grammar and we got a lot of points taken off (He averages the substance and grammar grades together). All in all, very difficult. Work hard and you will do fine.", "Dr. Ferguson is an awesome teacher. He knows his stuff and he makes his class very fun. Assingments are easy and he is very clear. Tests are easy if you look over notes. No book was required. He was the best teacher I have had yet. I hated to see this class end!

Attend class and participate and you will get an A", "Tests are hard, but he helps you get prepared for them. I feel like I'm learning. slowly. But I'm learning. Thanks Prof. Bowman.", "Phil is awesome. He spoon feeds you. All you need to do is put in the numbers from the problem on the test. is it was 5+6-7 on your homework, itll be like 8+9-6 on the test. you just need to study the process. people who dislike him are EXTREMELY lazy.", "I took Social Psych from him.

You really only need the book to for a few questions on the tests that don't reference his slides. I took this class online and had a blast. If you need to take a communications class take this class with this professor. You won't regret it.", "Best professor ever. Genuinely a nice guy who just wants everyone to do well. Tests are nearly identical to the review problems he assigns. Always willing to clarify concepts in lecture and holds plenty of office hours.", "Classes are not challenging. He doesn't engage the students; when he talks, he's often one-tracked and opinionated. Course work is dull and repetitive. Ideal class for slackers. Nothing lost (but time), nothing gained.", "Pretty easy. Tests are 10 T/F questions and one essay. He gives hints about what essay question will be. Dont have to buy textbook. Short readings. No quizzes. Uses Canadian grading scale- A:100-80; B 79-70; etc.", "A good prof but a bit of a hypocrite, not sure why he is at Nyack...", "He is not an easy teacher but he is very helpful, considerate, and funny. I learned how to like math bec. of him. He encourages students to ask questions and explains things in simple and clear manner.Students who are scared of math should take him. He is the best teacher ever !!!! :)", "Labs are short. Tests don't really cover what is covered in class. Textbook is not used.", "The universe is amazing.", "Great Teacher!!! I found that he was extremely helpful and welcoming to any who came to his office for help. He also helped us to better understand careers in mathematics. Easy grader and offers easy extra credit problems.", "Dr. Curra really cares for his students. He is very helpful and will do whatever it takes to help and encourage his students to succeed. Yes, the tests can be hard. Just read the material and pay attention to his lectures and you'll do fine! He knows what he's talking about and he's a very intelligent individual. Communicate with & you'll do great!", "No Comments", "He really wants us to be educated and goes out of his way enormously to help his students. He's a great professor and a great advisor. Funny too. Take his class..", "The first moment I saw him I laughed. He looks somewhat homeless. However he is a great teacher. Clear, easy and the midterms and final are pretty much a breeze. Can turn in homework late and still get credit. Attendence not always necessary. Studders a lot and goes off on tangets, but it's good for zone out time. Easy GE class- I recommend him.", "Best professor at DePaul. This professor really cares about his students. He gives a couple of essays for the quarter but makes it really easy to pass. Let's you redo any assignment until you receive full credit. I enjoyed every minute of this class and it was a night class. So happy I took him.", "Very cool guy. He's really easy going and doesn't teach you stuff you don't need to know for the class.", "His class is how any college course should be. He is very passionate about his subject and demonstrates so much knowledge. The point of the class is to understand our government and as long as you show up, review your notes, and prepare for class, you will succeed in that and it will be interesting. Don't expect an easy class; this is college.", "best professor at john jay easy easy easy A all he recuires is a paper", "Class consists of six exams and two papers.

Wish I could take more classes with him.", "This class covers: corporate growth, debt & equity financing, and dividends. These topics are not taught in other courses. There are five projects. The math is not hard. Explaining the formulas can be difficult. Exceptional professor! Exceptional course!", "He is the best professor I have ever had! He has so much energy so it doesn't matter if you take him in the morning or at night he will keep you awake. Take notes in class, participate and attend class you should be fine.", "This man is the most arrogant and self righteous person I have ever met. Told us on the first day of class that he doesn't assign A's, does not give his email to undergrads because we ask stupid questions, and overall makes you feel belittled. This man should not be teaching 100-level English.", "Expect to lose points for the most trivial things. Extra output, incorrectly formatted output; lose a third of the credit on the project, or more.

Avoid at all costs.", "No Comments", "ABSOLUTE WORST TEACHER AT SONOMA STATE!!!! DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR SEMESTER RUINED!!!!!", "This class was the longest class of my life. Lectures are extremely long! He stands in front of a stand and reads the lectures to you the entire time. Go to the SI Sessions if they are available! I learned everything from the SI sessions. He gives 2 grades the entire semester :midterm and final both you must write during class like a test.", "Is a tough grader, will get really snippy if you're tardy more than once, will get snippy if you are absent more than twice, will get irritable if not enough people participate during class, even with all his moodiness he was very good at critiquing papers and always wanted his students to progress. YOU HAVE TO DO THE WORK! and come to class.", "If you will take his class it will be your nightmare semester. Course is very good to study but he studies like we have done Ph.D. and know all things. Lectures are sleepy. Homework is very tough as well exams. Don't take his class otherwise ready to ruin your semester and grades.", "Raymond is the best. He is a great person to get to know. Some of the other teachers may help you to grow as a desginer more but with Raymond you truely get a friend.", "The class is very interesting with movies you would probably never have seen otherwise. Dr. Bell is very knowledgeable about the topics but it gets a bit boring. His lectures only last about 30 minutes though because you watch a film every class period. Quizzes are very hard, make sure you read!", "good teacher also is willing to help answer questions. fair grader and explains why you missed points. good personality.", "Good professor, knows what he's talking about. He'll make you think deeper into the subject, if you actually come to class. Attendance was never mandatory. He specifically says \"Show up to class regularly\". So, half the semester is enough. Come in, sign in, leave. Just do the 2 papers, make sure you answer all of the questions, you'll pass.", "Aaagh! He is the college dean's husband - in that sense he's more part of the architecture than part of the curriculum. Sometimes I see him coming and I run away. Don't bother. You pay lots of money to be here.", "Jerry's classes are tough. He expects a LOT from his students, but is very knowledgeable about all things Russian. He gives you all you need to know in lecture so take a lot of notes & do the readings to participate (25% of your grade). Tests are a crap shoot of what will be there, but if you attend class, take good notes, & study you can do well.", "No Comments", "He means well but the way he talks can be hard to understand. Also his theory is to say how much you suck ass with filming and then hopefully that motivates you to do better. I have to say it worked for me", "Very nice and very understanding. Class is all lecture but I never got bored. He takes the time to explain everything you need to know for the tests. Six quizzes (drops two), three tests (drops one) and a final. There is a short paper but it is fairly simple. I taking him again next semester, he is great!", "a little repetition in the class, but that just means the material sticks more! Calm, cool, collected. Great prof!", "There is definitely a lot to learn from him. Pay attention to all he does, his techniques are great.", "Daniel was a very good teacher. He could have taught more about sculpture, but instead gave us materials and sent us on our way. I would have liked more interaction and instruction in this class, but Daniel was very constructive with his criticism and was genuinely interested in helping his students do well. Pretty good for a foundation class", "No Comments", "this is my 3rd semester with mr. jones, and the reason for that is because he is a wonderful teacher! really nice, knows his stuff, very smart. i learned alot about theory too, teaches what should be taught. encourages everyone to play. inspired me to keep on learning. very fun class. if you want to learn, take this class, worth it!!!", "I adore this man. SO awesome. Such a great professor.", "Tony is such a cute professor! He sort of reminds me of a turtle, but I don't want to diss him because he's really enthusiastic about economics. I don't think econ is very interesting, but his lectures go really fast and usually get out early. I still don't like econ a lot, but I'm glad he was my professor. He also gives extra credit assignments!", "this prof is teriable i will never ever take him again. sucks at teaching anything. however he will give you extra credit.", "very nice man but horrible teacher. Comes late, won't look over work, and is completely deaf. You have to repeat yourself a billion times, and then he still doesn't hear you and tells you to speak up? Imagine how much fun taking attendence was.", "He's the Devil incarnate. Right now I can already tell you he hates you. Evil! Avoid at all times.", "lectures are helpful (majority of what is covered in lecture will be on the exam), he posts study guides & past exams to help you prepare for each upcoming exam, there are many extra credit opportunities- if you don't take advantage of it there's something wrong with you.", "Sends the most hilarious emails, if you don't get his sarcasm you will hate him, accent is thick but still easy to understand. Attending the lectures is a must, content isn't posted online. Doing an assignment every week is annoying but easily brings up your grade. Midterms and exams were fair to what we saw in class, posts old tests and breakdown.", "He may be smart and know his stuff but he is a HORRIBLE professor and I love physics. He constantly talks down to the class and acts like he is revolutionizing your world view, or like you have never thought about the universe before. He rushes over formulas and never does them with you, he just shows a slide of how he did them.", "I thought that Professor Allard was awesome! He is an excellent speaker which made lectures interesting and engaging. This was my first english class in university and he made sure that the students understood clearly what was expected of them and was very approachable if you had any questions. I am always looking for more of his classes to take!", "chaney is amazing!! had him for an 8am on a monday and he made it totally bearable! he is hilarious and gives you a lot of creative freedom! take him !!", "Bob.. Is fabulous! He helps people when they need help. If you are worried he will reassure you that everything will all work out in the end! He teaches you not to give up on yourself and to remember that you can do this work-- all you have got to do is try and take BOB!", "Wonderful teacher of any class in Philosophy. You are guaranteed to learn a lot.", "Dr. Pynadath did a great job teaching. The difficulty of his tests were such that his teaching exellence was required.", "Dr. Hupp is one of my favorite professors ever! His lectures are fun yet informative. You'll never be bored in class, but you'll still learn a lot. The funny stories he tells about his kids really help with the material sometimes. If you show up and pay attention, you should do just fine in his child psych course.", "He was an awesome teacher. Very clear and concise with his instruction. He was intolerant of students who didn't pay attention, but it was the students fault for not paying attention. I would take all of my future classes with him. Period.", "Pat is one of the most amazing and approachable professors @ WFU; he genuinely cares about student learning (not grades) and inspires students to take learnings beyond the classroom. He's a real asset to the facility of the University; I would definitely take him again if possible.", "Fairly unintelligent, and narcissistic as the day is long. If you accidentally make him feel threatened your grade WILL suffer, as his grading method is entirely subjective", "He was very helpful, very interested in your own opinions and those of the class.

Because of him, I <3 collages.", "Great instructor, very helpful, multiple choice tests. great class", "Everyone here seems to be giving hi bad reviews but he's really a nice guy. He's a little bit hard to understand but you get used to it. Tests are really easy and there's usually a big curve. Do the homework and you'll get a good grade. I loved him.", "Loved his class. Has a great sarcastic sense of humor and tells interesting stories. People are just scared to actually STUDY in college..", "Dr. Bergeson is the best professor I've ever had. He's goofy and eccentric and keeps his lectures entertaining, and somehow learned almost all of the names of every student in each of his 150 student classrooms. He teaches the material simply, and tests on what he's taught us in class - nothing came as a surprise, ever. Very accessible.", "The worst! Anything that contradicts his argument he dismisses as \"it doesn't matter cause it's just comics\" THEN WHY ARE YOU TEACHING A COURSE ON THEM? In one class a girl called him out on taking a quote out of context, his response: \"I know but it's so much more delicious this way.\" Great reading list but that's all. AVOID HIM LIKE THE PLAGUE!!", "Snapple face 120: you can't get better then Ric", "One of the best profs I have had at yorku. He made it a goal to connect with every student and help them. He is just so knowledgeable and enthusiastic, he makes you want to learn more. The material was quite difficult and at times he went through it quickly, but he made you study it through his pop quizzes. Yorku is very lucky to have him.", "No Comments", "ed's one cool hot guy.", "Great guy - he's very clear and knows what he's talking about. The tests were very straight foreward, as were the assignments, and his odd expressions and variety of coloured markers help keep your attention if you're starting to drift. Keep on top of the work, otherwise it will seem harder than it is", "Excellent prof! Take his course. If you put in the effort to improve you will be rewarded. Isn't that exactly what this university thing is about?", "AWESOME AND CRAZY! He will say ANYTHING! Easy A. I think we only had one test besides the final. JUST COME TO CLASS! You have to write a 25 page journal but it is very easy because it can be about ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING such as the pizza you at last night. Very caring personality. Likes to talk about \"Hot Dogs and Doughnuts\"", "He is pretty much one of the most useless professors at Montclair. I don't really have anything to say about him other than the fact that he is useless and a miserable human being. What a shame too, because the FCST department is full of wonderful professors. Unfortunately for him he just cannot compare. Take somebody else.", "The class was kind of iffy.. and what we were supposed to learn was kind of unclear.. then again.. it is kind of a weird filler cse class i guess.. but arvo tried his best.. tried to teach us as much as he could and was always willing to give us extensions or clarifications on hw problems.. good guy", "Paul was a nice guy, but he was a ridiculously hard grader. He had no grace with any grades. Over the top and should not be teaching. He is too smart to be teaching college kids. If you dont talk in class you dont get any participation points. I would NEVER take him again. Im telling you, SAVE YOUR SELF!!", "Andy Katz is a great guy, and the classes I took with him were some of the best experiences I had at Denison. He's very personable, and gets you to really engage with material. He's also quite available outside of class, and I'd suggest dropping in on office hours just to talk, not even about class. You won't regret taking a course with Katz.", "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. There is a reason he has over 40 ratings. This is my first time rating a teacher because I need to vent. 1.) Not a teacher.. You take pages of notes almost every class that he reads word for word off a slides show. 2.) He Is very slow 3.) GPA killer. Test are all essay question in which he grades very hard. 4.) BORING!", "I love Todd! I thoroughly enjoy attending his class, he makes it extremely entertaining.", "Extremely hard .Too many papers ,assignments,in class assignments .Too much materials covered for a 3 unit class .", "I was hoping that Mr. Kmetzo was still teaching at NVCC, as he was one of the most inspiring teachers that I've ever had and I wanted to comment. Kmetzo still stands out in my memory as one of the best teachers, even though I took his classes in '89! Funny and interesting person - Highly recommended", "I took him twice. I felt the difficulty of his class was fair, The exams were short answer and multiple choice. The daily quizzes he gives, do help you papare for the exams. His grading criteria is clearly laid out. If you do the homework, you should be able to pass the class with no issuies.", "Inspirational professor and interesting course. He has a lot of experience working in the EHS field., and he brings \"real work\" to lecture.", "Fair is one of the professors truly interested in the students at the law school (I don't say that to slight other professors). I enjoyed his class and knowing him as a person. I do however refuse to rate his \"hotness.\"", "If you have a dispute with your TA over a grade Madden will regrade it, and the grade he gives you is your permanent grade. According to his secretary, he grades harder than the TA's do. Therefore, he is not willing to consult you with such problems.

Open book/note test and if you answer all the questions on the study guide, you should get an \"A\" in the class", "No Comments", "I took this class during the summer, we went outside almost every single day to walk along the lake, in the woods,& sometimes to do some very messy &gross activities. Going to class & outside earns you participation pts. He is not very good at conveying material in class so you NEED to read the book to do well on exams. There is LOTS of memorizing.", "Easy class, scattered professor but effective. Miss a few weeks & you will suffer in the class. Miss once & you are ok. Quizzez & fill in the blank tests are covered in the class, so you know exactly what he wants to see... Just show up, take decent notes & its a pretty easy A", "Arrogant! Only an associate prof. Associate dean is just a useless title to make himself feel superior. Terrible engineering administration. Anyways a REAL academic would not sit in admin positions!", "He truly is a nice old man and will help you but is very old fashioned. He gives out packets for you to learn the material basically on your own but let's you do test/quiz corrections which is nice. His lectures are basically just examples and can be disorganized. He wants you to write steps out but he skips steps himself which causes confusion.", "Dr. Anning is a great Prof. he is monotone and loves to talk your head off but is also overly willing to help. He pays attention to the little details so take the time to cross your t's and dot your i's. There is no text book so you will have to keep track of your handouts, they are used for an open note final.", "HE IS ONE THE BEST PROFS I HAVE EVER HAD! HE WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HIS STUDENTS.

Very good to talk to during office hours. He speaks with a passion that is hard to find in a lot of professors. Lectures often don't relate to the books but still are very interesting to those concerned with German culture. If you have the chance take a class with this professor. it will be a good experience.", "best prof in this univ", "I enjoyed this class because Mr. Qureshi is intelligent and using humor to teach intermediate algebra. He's known for saying, \"This is a beautiful equation\" and \"You are a good student\".", "I think he's well past his prime, mentally speaking.

Open note exams, with questions often coming straight from lecture or Homework.", "Worst art teacher I have ever had. Loved himself. Discouraged all creativity. We disagreed on one project and he was unbeleviably rude to me, and because of our disagreement he almost failed me.\r DONT EVER TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS TEACHER.\r Awful. Im and art major, and I have never been so disgusted.", "Great teacher! He knew how to push me to reach my potential. He always offered help before and after class for those who wanted it. His tests were easy if you studied for them. I wish he was not limited to just Math! He would be great in other subjects as well. He relates with his students since he has been there before.", "I was really interested in sports bargaining but this class was not the appropriate forum for it. Kahn takes too much time trying to cover things that are repetitive, boring, and not necessary for the exams. The presentations are fun to work on, but you also need a good group to do it with.", "Easy teacher, but don't expect to really get anything out of the class. He could make jokes, but I found him to be disorganized and arrogant. Don't ask to see him after class...he complains constantly about how he has no time.", "This class was so much fun.

Class is boring but he is helpful if you ask for help.", "Nice guy, class was boring (I took it for a filler; not a law student. Might have been the problem). Very helpful and candid with his students. Course was just boring - mostly reading ye olde English Lawe records - like Shakespeare without the drama. Very dry. Cool guy though.", "This was the most boring class I have ever taken at Western. I got the worst grade in this class I have ever gotten in college. He has an interesting sense of humor, but I think he is rude, and it is very impossible to follow his lectures without falling asleep because is voice is monotone. I couldn't go to class without falling asleep.. STAY AWAY!", "Extremely easy lab teacher, quizzes are a little difficult though.

Do not complain you teacher.", "One of the best professors I have ever had. He gives good feedback, has an upbeat personality, and will help you out with any difficulties. He makes his lectures interesting and puts you at ease when presenting a speech, which especially helps for the anxious. His study guides for tests are terrific, and I highly recommend him!", "I had Mr Glennon last year. This teacher cannot teach. I studied the book for hours and when I didn't understand something, he would refer me to the book, if he said anything at all. If you care about your GPA, avoid this teacher. This is the only class I've ever recieved a D+ in,and I studied ALOT. He's pretty mean and doesn't care about the class", "Awful prof!! Most horrible boring class you'll ever take. Very unorganized and his lectures make no sense. Half the time he talks about some house he built!", "People told me their English 300 classes were a waste of time, but this class was not like that at all. I learned a lot of useful information about different writing assignments. The instructor explains how to do an assginment, and he answers all questions until you know what he wants. I recommend Inman because he cares about what you are learning.", "Dr.Hardy is a very fair teacher. You MUST DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!hint(you never know when it might count as your test.

Love him dearly!", "Great teacher who explained things very clearly. Sometimes gives a little too much info, but is overall the best chem teacher I've had.", "He makes it harder than it has to be. Course moves very quickly. The gradding scale is the only saving grace. 100-80 is an A, 79-65 B, 64-55 C, 54-45 D. And he drops your lowest test and quiz grade. Seems ridiculous but you will need it, our class average on the last test was a 50%. Good Luck!", "The man is very informative on guitar technique. He will be the best guitar instructor you will ever have. Doesn't discriminate on playing ability. He helps everyone who tries their best. He kinda looks like the Treat Williams, the dad on Everwood.", "His accent is difficult to understand and it's not helped by his incredible messy handwriting. You'll have to teach yourself the material out of the book. He's also very condescending to anyone who asks a question. He gives a lot of homework, but it's not too tricky.

He is very knowledgeable and well published in his field.", "He is a very straightforward teacher. He wants us to do well and not fool around.

I am so glad I signed up for his course!", "Professor McCauley is the best professor I have had York. He posts his PowerPoints which makes it easy when studying for the mid term and the final.

Putting aside his monotone inflection, he was an excellent teacher, and I enjoyed the course.", "Although Paciocco is a leader in his field, he does make the material more difficult to understand than need be. His classes are incredibly stimulating, but, again, he should keep things simple. I found his final, compared to the mid-term, particularly difficult. Beware of this. Expect him to ask you to do a memo and essay for the final.", "Read your book and you will make an A.You must read and pay attention to the lectures!!", "He's a pretty tough grader, but he basically tells you what he wants. He takes writing seriously and rates reading even higher than that. If you're an intellectual, he's your kind of professor. If you're lazy and just someonewho's his course cuz you think it'll be easy, don't bother showing up.", "BORING!!!\r He was mumbling something for several classes and then students were doing the presentations...\r did not teach anything in class but the final was Hard and from the book...", "Best instructor ever. I LOVED his biker gangs class... He knows his stuff. Got me really interested in this stuff", "No Comments", "Mark is the BEST. He loves challenging people, but is always available to help. He goes out of his way to make sure everybody does the very best possible and learns LOTS.", "This mas has been teaching the same way for the last 30 years and hasn't changed a thing during his time at EKU. Once he hates you, he will ALWAYS hate you. Don't get on his bad side. There is one way to learn in his mind and that is HIS way. To stay awake in his class is a true challenge. It's time to hang it up Dr. Ferguson.", "Droge was great. He really knows his stuff and makes you think for yourself. The classes are challenging and entertaining.", "He makes the class very easy, gives lots of hands on examples. Can get an A on the tests just by studying the lecture notes for 1-2 hours. Very nice guy!", "Really wants his students to do well. Lectures are long and wordy but you will do well if you go to class.", "No Comments", "Worley rocks!! He's an awesome proffessor, and an awesome director. I loved being in his classes", "He was very accessible, always gave feedback and answered very fast. I took this course online so I'm not sure how entertaining he is, but I did not have a problem with this course even though it was my first online course. You have to submit online discussions every single week, grading for all assignments is clear.", "i really didn't like the class because when i tried to come up with ideas - mine were shot down and he gave me a new one i felt like i had to go with.... anyways i did alright in the class but i wasn't happy with the way he guided my ideas so much", "Have had him for several classes. Study the power point and you will get an A but know it inside and out. He is a wonderful caring professor who will go out of his way to explain things. Sometimes he seems a little annoyed if you ask too many questions but he always is willing to answer them. You get out of class early.", "Great prof who CAN be an ass, but is good none the less. I really enjoy my time working with him.", "He's such a nice and caring man. He reminded me so much of a grandfather. His tests were a little hard, so make sure you study. He gives you different options for tests so you can choose what works best for you. His lectures were boring at times, but you feel bad not paying attention since he's so nice. I would definitely recommend him.", "hes the best prof ive had here", "Great professor but something you should know right off the bat is that tests arent multiple choice. Theyre matching, true and false, and a type of fill in the blank. He knows a lot of interesting facts but the textbook isn't really necessary. You need to study but he offers a lot of help. You never use the textbook so don't buy it", "Professor Allen is very inspirational, if you like to write you will like them. He makes class entretaining and is very caring.", "really hard class, you need to come prepared for each class to succeed. Make sure to pay attention during the lectures otherwise you'll be lost. READ the textbook", "Dr. Andy makes this class very interesting, I would take it for sure! My favorite professor that I have had at Davis.", "MUST TAKE !! do hw , lecture examples, extra problems, and your golden", "D is a truly remarkable educator. He is passionate about what he practices and it transcends to the students. He is an inspiring professor, and the \"writing intensive\" part of the course is hardly noticeable, in part because we write a little every day. It is reading intensive, however, the reading is valuable and fascinating.", "No Comments", "Good as person but not as teacher. Very Very hard. If you are looking for an A, you will never get it in this class. Don't do it. In the essay i got 65 after that he gave us revision essay so i improved my essay as per his suggestions and he gave me 69, are you kidding me??? You have to be book author to receive an A in the essay. Hell NO", "His class is really easy to pass. His study guides are usually around 120 questions long but they're all on quizlet so you really have nothing to worry about. If you study the quizlet, you'll pass his tests.", "Easiest math class you could possibly take. He gives you the test questions and then lets you retake the tests if you dont like your score. He is really nice.", "He is very easy. He always tries to scare his student at the beggining, but just like the NAZI regime fell so will he and in the process I got an A. Dont let him intimidate you. Also I dropped the class after I found out he was teaching so you should do the same.", "Nice guy, but AWFUL prof never hands things back and he is the most unorganized prof you will ever have. Does not have actual notes. Text book is very unclear. You won't know what you have in the class until final grades are in. Unless you have a lot of time to devote to this class do not take it! It is not an easy A!", "He gives two test during the semester. But the test is 100+ questions and sometimes he's questions are sometimes weird. He gives a lovely curve and you must attend all classes to get a decent grade in the class, and the lectures are not that bad. Besides he is the only 1 that teaches the course.", "DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. The exams are a load of crap. He doesn't teach anything that's on it and we would spend a whole class talking about two equations that we he openly admitted we didn't have to learn. He lost my first exam, didn't come to class because he \"lost track of time.\" I withdrew from this class as fast as I could. He's horrible.", "Only had him once, but the university needs more teachers like him.", "thoroughly enjoyed him as a teacher and as a person...very helpful.", "EXCELLENT PROFESSOR! Organized, test was comprehensive if you followed along in lectures, experiments were fun and assignments went along with the class. He is very accessible and office hours are great! He was very nice and made a point of trying to get to know everyone's name the first day of class. Lab reports were long, but facilitated learning", "He is a great professor. Always willing to help. Not a set curve, just curved based on how everyone does on the exams. Always reviews homework and always extended homework. Always willing to help. Can be confusing at times, but i would take him again", "Everything said before is true, he can be arrogant and he does mark ridiculously hard but all for the reason of improvement. My first essay was a C and after taking his feed back and applying it to my writing I improved a whole letter grade. This is university, teachers are not going to hold your hand. He knows his stuff and expects you to work", "His intelligence and personality is so sexy. Can't wait to take his Vietnam class next year. This guy rocks! By far the best prof I have ever had here at UVIC.", "this guy will bend over backwords to make sure you understand the material and that you pass the class. and the fact that he gives you photocopies of the notes is key.", "He is so easy, funny, and laid back. If you're not into English, I recommend taking him. He's not uptight and has street smarts unlike some professors.", "He's always 5 minutes late but he's always there for students. He will let you know exactly where you stand in class and is always willing to help you improve. Funny guy too when he relates his stories about his son Ian in class. Definitely take a class from Dr. Gordon.", "Dr. Baker is one of the best teachers I have had. He seems interested in what he is teaching and makes it interesting to learn. He is one of the best at leading and encouraging participation in class discussions.I don't think it would be possible to take a class with him without learning something and enjoying learning it.", "Overall he was very keen about what he was teaching. He didn't make it easy for us to feel the same way, and at times he was slightly off-putting in regards to subject matter. There was never a clear focus and it always seemed like the weirder the better was the way to go.", "What a harda** - I made an appointment to go in and discuss a paper topic, and he blew me off.\r When I called him, I had to leave 3 voicemail messages because he's never around. A total technophobe, he's inaccessible.\r He also blamed the missed appointment on me, saying he had written down the next week tho' I programmed it into my phone's calenda", "This is a man of striking brilliance; if you are looking for an intellectual challenge - definitely take his class. Course requirements are pretty easy - there was no final exam, just writing comments on assigned readings (all on his website) and a paper.", "Very easy, but also very boring. Class was based around stereotypes for the entire semester, it gets old after a while. Case studies are also pointless, take it with someone else if you plan on getting something out of the class.", "when he lectured, it was clear... during his critiques you were ripped apart if you did something slightly off or what you thought (at the time) was funny. He plays favorites though, if anybody ever played favorites it was him. And, wouldn't you know, he always only wanted to give help ONLY to the skinny white chicks...", "Dr. Betts is a wonderful teacher. He is always willing to help if you need any clarification on anything. Really knows his stuff. He makes you work for your grade, but he's fair and clear on what he's looking for.", "Some of this stuff can be confusing or not interesting for most people. There are a lot of readings so be prepared. The number one mistake is not showing up to class. His lectures and class discussions give a lot more clarity to the content. Not bad, but kind of a demanding prof.", "The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.", "Professor Stettner has a wide variety of knowledge about species from fish, plants, animals, etc. He takes the time to explain important concepts and is approachable by office hours or email if you have issues. If you are not the best at science or not a good student, there is more than enough extra credit to keep your grade in good standing.", "We did nothing but take notes. And he flipped through the overhead notes so fast few got them down. Tests based on notes. His basic level class had more work than advanced courses. The only save from notes was the current events first thing of class which we learned to prolong as much as possible.", "TOok distance ed course - SO boring. I didn't listen to the lectures b/c they put my to sleep. He NEVER got back to me about any of my questions, and all his supplementary material was VERY out of date.", "worst prof I've ever had in 5 years at York! believe me, I studied.. I went to every class lecture.. I even went to the writing department for help and I still managed to get a C on my papers? he's very UNFAIR, everyone gets the same presentation mark.. stay far away if you want to pass! GREAT COURSE, he just taught NOTHING to do with the course", "You will not learn haw to throw in this class do not listen when he says to glaze greenware you pieces wiil be ruined", "Very cool and insightful. A good first semester freshman class.", "If he is still teaching his 'Rhetoric of the Civil Rights Movement' please take it. One of the best classes Denison has to offer.", "I really enjoyed the disscussions in this class...when I could stay awake. Great guy, but \"dry wit\" is a good description. He has an unobtrusive monotone voice, so it's super easy to zone out during lectures. Don't panic if you don't get to al", "This class is no joke. He give 6 tests the whole semester and drops the lowest test score. If u do the extra credit that's 11 points. So if u have 69% and did all the extra credit you'd have a B in the class. He is pretty helpful if you go to his office. The class is hard as hell..i wouldnt take the class again.if u like science this will be ya boy", "This class was extremely boring. Even though he gives you everything that is on the midterm and final there is an insane amount of information to know. Most of the info terms you have to look up on-line because you were not able to find it in pages of notes and he will NOT HELP YOU AT ALL.", "Great and very helpful. Dry sense of humor, but when he gets down to business he demands respect when talking.", "He mostly taught of whats wrong with Plato and Aristotelean views and why his philosophies are right.Very ignorant to Abrahamic religions made me believe that he has never really read a Bible or Quran because he was off in his facts.But if you want to know his views hes great.I had him his last semester so he must have already checked out upstairs", "He is okay at explaining things but definitely go to class, the slides are useless. Recording the lectures is helpful because the tests are extremely hard. Be careful with the online quizzes too, he never reminds you and they're easy to miss and forget about.", "My high school football coach could teach better than this man. Attendance is taken through clicker quizzes that have huge effect on grades. He is extremely rude 1 on 1 and belittles students. No formula sheet so good luck memorizing all the equations for the final. I guess studying 20 hrs for the final isn't good enough to pass. 50% averages rip:)", "Took online class. Very easy. Some of the answers are wrong on the tests and after showing him where it said otherwise in the book he quickly changed the grade. He will reopen tests if you want a better grade. Never met but I would recommend.", "I've taken two classes from him. His is my all-time favorite: enthusiastic, helpful, funny, fair, knowledgeable, etc... Take him soon before he retires completely!", "No longer teaching. Professror Emeritus. Laid a good foundation for future teachers to model. His clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses. Master teacher", "Dr. Salloway needs to retire ASAP. He may have been great in the past, but he's starting to slip. He is always angry, which seems to influence his grading/approachability. He needs to take care of his issues BEFORE he comes in to class. He tries to be funny, and gets a few nervous chuckles, but otherwise is NOT well liked, at least this semester.", "Not the most organized teacher but the class is not too difficult. He rarely collected homework and he always gave out study guides for the tests. 3 tests and 5 geometry software assignments. Go to class and you'll do fine.", "I am obsessed with David Hyde. I am majoring in sociology and have taken every class he has at SPS. He should be teaching at the University level because he is a walking, talking genius! If you print out the PP notes at the start of class and follow along with lectures, taking notes on PP's, you can't go wrong. EVery day is interesting!", "Dennis is by far the best teacher I've ever had. He's hilarious and brilliant. He is also an incredible person and anyone who gets to know him is very lucky. His classes are incredible--take one.", "Riegle is awesome.He has a great interest in relating the material to stuff you learned in other classes.DO THE STUDY GUIDE and you'll do fine.The tests questions are right out of it!In lecture he pretty much tells you the essay question :)", "easy to disagree with and argue ponits of disagreement", "best teach in polisci dept", "The course I took with professor Chapman was world history, but was dissapointed that we mostly looked over Greek and Roman history. As for the rest of the world, like Asia, Africa and Americas, we only saw pictures with minimal or no explanation. Very easy class though.", "I had not taken algebra for over a decade when I signed up to take college algebra with Mr. Ream. He truly wants students to succeed and as long as you do the assigned homework and reach out to him if you are struggling, he is more than happy to do whatever he can to help. He tries to make math fun and gives curves on the exams - highly recommend", "He is a nice guy but his teaching style is really hard to understand.", "He lectures were entertaining and eye opening. There is a fair amount of homework in the class and must read the textbook if you want to do well in class. That was my problem I just listened and took notes on Powerpoints but didn't read text book like students who recieved a better grade than me", "Good prof. Cares and gives you multiple opportunities to succeed. Always willing to answer questions outside of class. My first class with him. Tests are hard, but watch the videos. Go to class and pay attention because it helps you learn. Definitely would take him again! Not an easy class though.", "Most definetly the worst professor I've ever had. I am a straight A science student and failed the first test. The book is impossible to follow (he wrote it) and is littered with mistakes. He treats intro physics students as if they've had physics before. I can usually learn from the text if the professor is horrible but he wrote the book, too.", "Horrible prof. I don't agree with earlier comments that if you attend you will do well. I have only missed one class and I am always lost. The tests are ridiculous. They have almost nothing to do with lecture and require you to remember tiny statistics out of the book. I would never take this prof again!", "VERY EASY!!! I never went to class and i made an A..He e-mails the notes and reviews to you, so you never have to go to class...Tests are straight from the notes..", "Although he can't really speak good English,but actually, all I can say is to study hard by yourself! But he is always a good prof. to seek for help! He will provide you as much as possible! Don't be afraid to seek help from him!", "Despite what others may say,Jorgensen is the the coolest and smartest prof in soc.his deal:he has been in davis for 30 years,his class isn't normal, it's creative,and he is constantly challenging ideas and making you think.What people can't handle is that he really cares about his material, and about his students, but he presents it differently.", "professor Strong is a really good professor class isn't easy ,and you will have to study ,take good notes ,and maybe even watch a couple of videos in order to really understand the material expected to know on Exams .Mr. Strong does tutor after class or before in groups if needed to prepare for exams .No quizzes, No homework Studying is HW", "a really nice guy. The whole class sleeps and he makes really corney jokes but it's a easy A. The test are easy and the final paper is only two pages and he is very generous with giving out A's. I recommend this class.", "Don't take his class! All he does is show youtube videos and gives out only 2 articles so the entire semester. There are two response papers and a final research paper with a presentation to go with it. He's completely irrational when it comes to grading. Don't take a chance. Attendance is sometimes called out or sign in sheet. This guy is a mess!", "Has around 11 blogs and group presentations. Allows the blogs to be revised for higher grade. Grades fairly and offers extra credit. Be prepared to read a lot and participate in class discussions. Blogs make up a large % of grade.", "No Comments", "one of the worst teachers I had at cca", "HE is one of the most BORING instructors I've ever had. He just reads the slides and you have to sit for 3 hours and listen. You have to study on your own , he doesn't help much.", "quite good proffesor", "tests unreasonably difficult--practically impossible to get an A. Never missed class, but almost never knew what he was talking about either.

Doesn't like to make sure you understand, just makes sure that you have heard what he said.", "Wow, how could you say he knows nothing about chinese history? Possibly the smartest prof i have ever had. He does struggle at keeping his lectures clear, but that's not his problem, it's yours. He's extremely smart and his tests and exam are easy.", "GPA boosting. Show up to class, do your best, and youll get an A! Exams arent cumulative and the project was marked generously. The students tend not to be as competitive or as smart as what would be found in accounting or finance classes, since most just take it as an easy option. Class is not curved, and relatively easy to get in the mid 80s.", "During the beginning of the course you would think he is a good professor. As the course progresses, you come to realize that he is a GREAT professor. Very tough on his students at times, but very impartial. Recommend him if you are serious about learning!", "EXTREMELY easy if you take a survey class with him. We had one final that was take home open book and no homework. Fairly entertaining and down to earth as well.", "Martin is very difficult, so if you're not taking this for future classes beware. He's probably the best out of all 102 profs, but you need to do so many extra practice probs to pass. Study 1 week+ before the test, no matter what. He can be rude, but you need to put it the work. He is the best @ concept/math balance so if you need future chem do it", "Biostatistics is a difficult topic. Many people do not attend class because it can be very boring, especially the 7pm class. The notes he provides are very clear, and the sample exams are perfect for studying for Exams. He is also shy, and make sure to ask your questions clearly and aloud.", "The class isn't the most interesting but D is great! He's really funny and nice and loves what he's doing. Expect a lot of reading. Participation in class and attendance is key. He just wants you to have an opinion and think/talk about what we're discussing.", "Great teacher wicked easy and supper helpful I loved every min o his class and he is writing the text book so there is no book to buy! SUPPER PLUS!", "Very good teacher. Hilarious. The first day of class with him, I was sure he was **** (He wasn't; he's just naturally that way). He knows ridiculous amounts of psychology. He also understands that taking physical notes is dumb. That's like +1000 points right there.", "I think Prof. Tim is a great instructor. If u want to specialize in Network & Security this is the class. It is true that he want's students to correct the PP slides & teach the class that is for students own advantage. Finally he curvers the class on the grade just do all the work. Attened all classes.

He makes sure that everyone understood the material.", "Nice guy, but hard grader", "This guy was ok but you have to work hard. He curves tests which is his only saving grace. I have a lot of trouble sometimes because he was very unclear about subject matter but after all I guess its Economics.", "Richard Shockey is a hottie!", "Professor Abert was a good professor. He teaches a little fast in my opinion but he is very knowledgeable. He takes attendance but does not give any in class quizzes. 10% of your grade is online LONCAPA and this alone will teach you everything you need to pass the class. He does not give study guides for the tests but you can just review LONCAPA.", "Dr. McAuliffe is a really nice person. He has trouble expressing himself in class but one-on-one he is extremely helpful. The reading load for his class was pretty light and just a term paper for graded work. No midterm or final. Weblogs due on a weekly basis and a heavy emphasis on class discussion", "Ralph is awesome at applying these things to your life as a believer...and he's funny and easy to talk to!!", "No Comments", "In my opinion he doesn't have a good way of teaching. He always quizzes you on grammar. He doesn't show any powerpoint or examples. And most of the time he spends the class time talking about things that aren't even related to anything in class, he always releases you early. He's one of those teachers that seem not to care.", "No Comments", "Pratt seems to really enjoy teaching and this is rare. His classes (this is the second I've taken with him) are challenging, but this is as it should be in law school.

ALL HE DOES IS READ FROM POWERPOINT AND TALK BS ABOUT ALL THESE HIGH POSITION JOBS HE HAD MAKING MILLIONS OF $ IN SALES.", "One of the best professors I've ever had - made the potentially boring subject matter interesting.

He cares a great deal about his students! I totally recommend him for a professor for an easy A+", "great class if you love weather. great prof if you want to learn. don't take if you're looking for an easy lab credit. his class really should be 300 level because its a serious science class. weather is a lot of physics. small number of engineers/science majors set the high grades and the rest of us got screwed.", "Honestly, he is one of the most eloquent men I have ever heard speak; however, it proves to be hard for him to stay on track. Lectures are extremely hard to follow due to his presentation (in other words, he's so smart he needs to hold it back a little bit). He is very emphatic about the New Testament and extremely stringent with grading.", "I eventually just stopped going to class and just taught myself the material. No website, no homework solutions, little or no lecture preparation.. If you are looking for someone to actually teach you math, avoid this prof.", "Great professor! some students say he's everywhere in his lecture but the truth is, he is very precise and he tells you exactly what he wants you to know. The class is difficult but he makes it light by injecting jokes here and there. If ur serious about learning anatomy, take him coz he knows what he's talking about.", "great teacher. hard class", "Best lecturer I have ever had, very interesting and you don't have to show up everyday if you don't want to. Would recommend showing up .", "Clearly would rather be doing his own research than condescending to teach. Very opinionated, and not tolerant of other opinions. Assigns his own articles for readings. Lectures are deadly boring. Does decent prep before midterm / final, but the TAs marked pretty tough.", "Very fun professor. He makes going to class fun and you still learn from him. He is also on the students side (ex. if you think you should have done better on a test, talk with him and he will most likely give you some extra points). I want to take as many classes with him as I can!", "He comes off weird at first but you'll get used to it. He knows his stuff and he's truly so nice! He offers a lot of extra credit and chances to do them so he wants you to pass! You can do bad on the exam and still pass the class with a B with all the extra credit opportunity. He crams a lot of questions on the exams too!", "And WHP 311! He is a great professor, very passionate and I highly respect him as a person. He is concerned that you do well and expects you to take an active part in the classes and in your education. He has a sweet accent and has many life stories that add to his classes!! Not a blow off by any means, but hes a GREAT GREAT PROFESSOR!", "I only took this class to get rid of a requirement but Professor Arvo made the class interesting. He's also a really nice guy who printed out notes for everybody who came to class. The notes are so good you probably don't have to go to class, but his lectures make life eaasier on you.", "If you like to read and memorize the textbook, you can take him for you psychology class. He's not an easy A teacher for me. He only give the extra credit for doing a volunteer job. nothing else for extra credit. I didn't have any attraction for psychology, his lecture isn't fun or interesting. He use slide and TV (not a fun show)for teaching.", "Mr Karakul really knows how to teach. He does not care about the stuff that the students do not need. Fair in grading, everything was prescheduled, quizzes , assignments, exams, examviewings... I really enjoyed this course. Just study before the exams, that's enough. Overall : very good !", "Very good instructor and specific about his expectations. Would take another class from him any time. If you don't like to follow directions, don't expect to do well (\"artistic license\" comes in upper division class, not foundation ones).", "I found him to be both uninterested in his students and in the subject matter. He spent the entire semester reiterating the same exact communications theories every other com. class at EMU teaches with nothing new or even remotely insightful to add. Doc Robinson \u00e2\u0080\u009clectures\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the dangers of dogmatic thinking, intolerance, and ethnocentrism yet, I have found him to be one of the most dogmatic, preachy, intolerant, and close-minded professors I have ever had.", "Very funny guy, always up for a laugh. Grades a little hard, but willing to help you out as best he can.", "loved reading DQ and other books, I mean Quixote... great course and excellent instructor.", "Teaches from a physics perspective, not a exercise science or AT perspective. VERY picky on tests. Spelling, angles of vectors...those have to be perfect. Lecture and lab are fair game for tests, as is information and diagrams from the textbook. No suprises on the test, just information that's difficult to comprehend.", "Professor Baer is a great teacher! He enjoys lectures and tends to mumble or speak fast, but always makes sure that you understand before moving on. He enjoys teamwork and has teams work for points.

I would absolutely take him again!", "best teacher and a great friend still today. quite an ex-hippy which is fine with me!!!! i love Dr. Zorn...", "Dr. Thielen (Tee-Lynn) is an amazing professor! You can tell he really enjoys what he does. I'm so glad I had him for a teacher. The class is very interesting, never a bore and the work level is moderate; just do the work..he believes in true learning not just memorizing for a test.", "He is definitely the best professor I have had in the English department. He is very helpful, witty, and funny. His class to me is fairly easy as long as you read the assignment and follow his models for how you answer things.

He never shows you how to do the same thing the same way two times in a row which can lead to some confusion. Writes things on the board that aren't testable Looses you as you try to decipher what he's written down.", "Disliked this professor. Tried extremely hard in the class and did not do so well on the final because of problems outside of the classroom and he lowered my grade to a C even though I had earned a B in the class as far as percentage wise. Makes you sign a contract that says he can do this. Awful.", "He really does make it easy for student, however, I don't feel like he has any ability to teach. Very hard to understand, but you don't need to listen in lectures to pass.", "He's alright. His lectures are long, and unclear because he tells us to write down random adjectives. I didn't read one of the books, and still passed with an A though. Mid term and final exam, 1 research paper, and weekly quizzes. Lecture slides are online.", "he doesnt explain anything...he isn't a very good teacher", "Mr. Dineen is an absolutely wonderful instructor. He really knows his stuff. Attendance is a must. Tests are difficult, but if you study you will do good. Your grade will reflect the effort you put into learning the material. He makes learning about politics fun and didn't try to sway us left or right. He made us make up our own minds.", "You get what you give. Bracken is not afraid to call students out on laziness and his \"honesty\" and high standards seem to unnerve undergrads. However, he's intelligent and well read, and classes are funny and exciting. He doesn't like email and office hours were near nonexistent, but if you've gone to every class, he will make time to talk to you.", "Ted is a great professor; he is at the top of his field and has clearly refined his curriculum. The class is split up into coherent, well organized units and he presents the material clearly and concisely. Makes the broad subject engaging with pop culture references and video clips! Definitely take IMS with Magder.", "This was my first class. Did all assignments, did pretty good on the Quizzes. His a good Professor. Reviews the work with you just in case you missed any assignments. I really learned how to use the Microsoft programs and the different stuff u can do. I highly Recommend him. Easy A.", "His version of a grading curve-- he gave everyone one point. PRAISE THE LORD! Very helpful though, in terms of a human being, one of the most compasionate teachers I've had in a long time.", "By far the worst teacher I had at RVC. Very condescending and often spoke to the students as if they were ignorant fools. There are many different speech teachers you can take for a better experience. Please stay away. There is no need to comment on the professional style of this professor. In my experience there was none.", "Strong knowledge and approach, although grades hard. Good professor to introduce new law students into the study of law, not to mention contracts.", "Great professor...amazing...inspirational...do not take him if you're not interested in philosophy.", "This class is hard. You will put in 3-4 hours of hw, and this must be done right since it is graded. Oh and you will be doing this blind, with no prior guidance. Class tries to cover too much material which never gets tested away.", "This guy litterally borders on racism. The entire semester, we talked about stereotypes, and I kept leaving class feeling like a lot of what I heard was how evil I am because I'm white. Further, he refuses to fully explain his assignments and he really doesn't explain anything very well at all.", "Probably the best teacher I've ever had. He just makes the whole class interesting. He's easy to understand and is very funny.", "Incredibly mean and heartless, constantly swears in class (\"G-dammit\", \"this f-in thing here\", and more...). Just rude, crude and crass.", "Dr. Terry is a great professor when it comes to knowing what he is talking about. He is brilliant when it comes to finance. But be warned his classes are tough no matter which class you take that he teaches. If you are confused about something don't be afraid to ask. He expects a lot out of you and for you to remember things from other classes.", "He is a really nice guy! If you try hard in his class and stay on top of the assignments he asks of you then you will seriously do well. Try to get on his good side, it pays off. He is a really smart guy and is very willing to help you out if you need. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! It makes him take you seriously and you learn a lot from his genius!", "Took his freshman seminar class and found it quite interesting. This was a pass fail class so it wasn't hard but he was helpful...he did talk a lot about his life but it was interesting to me.", "Todd is a really good teacher.", "he is a really funny person, i think that everyone should take a class with him. he posts everything on blackboard! rocks for jocks cant get easier than this", "Delgado is a easy teacher just as long you do your work.His test may seem a little long but if you study you should be able to pass easily. He has the abilty to make all his student feel at ease. Very funny, and out of 10 I would rate his bottom a 7 (pinch!!!!) thanks you Jesse", "Mr. Rose brings the world of the unseen to life in his Microbiology class. His attention to detail in lecture and lab is impeccable. By the end of the course I feel that I knew a lot about infectious disease, working with bacterial cultures in lab, and safety. Mr. Rose is a kind and caring professor, while maintaining rigor and professionalism.", "Take This Teacher if you can!!! He is awesome awesome awesome!!! I still email him sometimes even though I've been out of his class for a long time. He's a great teacher and a great person.", "This Professor (supposedly) taught mechatronics to me, mechanical-electrical devices, according to the text and curriculum mainly involving controls related to ladder logic. All of the labs were recycled from previous courses and did not apply, questions often took weeks to get answers, and the lecture was completely off subject.", "Great professor, would highly recommend him.", "I'll take two posts to describe this guy: he's got nothing but rocks on the brain, that's for sure. Designs some ridiculous course with no structure and throws out some ridiculous haphazard notes package for you to try and follow through. Not at all helpful, in class or in lab (labs, by the way, are weekday nights from 5pm - 8pm, what a joke)...", "Beware of Dr Fernando as a professor or advisor. He does not teach to broad learning styles in students. It can be a serious problem for someone who needs to understand plant science taught by him. He relies on textbooks. When answering questions, he was more intolerant and unhelpful than any other teacher I have ever had.", "Just don't. Unless you're one of his favorites. It's like you think you understand the assignment - you could even meet with him about your ideas and he'll be supportive - and then you make a low grade because you apparently didn't give him what he wanted.", "Class content overall not hard. Forum posts are easy and are based off your opinion. The test? 4 chapters. 50 questions with 40 minutes you do the math. YOU HAVE TO KNOW IT. If not you are doomed. But it's so much information it really is hard to know what he will test you on.", "He teaches like a kid that is excited for a present on Christmas but it makes a usually dull subject engaging. I had him in the morning and he was almost better than coffee for waking me up.", "one of the best professors I have ever had! class is extremely structured. effort is required. learned a lot from his class. nice guy too.", "His language courses are extremely tough and I have seen students cry during the oral exams. He is very caring with those he believes to be making an effort but he is harsh on others. Don't take his class if you want to focus on your core courses. Hardest course I've taken and I may fail it....", "Don't buy the book. Tests are from PP.", "His class is pretty simple, but if you want to get an A in the class you really have to try. You have to read the assignments assigned because he gives daily online quizes. Visit him during office hours and he'll help you with writing your papers!", "I just wish we would stop talking about Rennie Stennet. Otherwise, he's OK and he smells good too.", "Folks, If you value your money never take him. I was surprised at his lack of knowledge and in defense he said \"This is a grad course, you dont expect me to know everything\", duh?", "Great professor, his class is really easy to pass. His work and essay topics are essay. Make sure to turn in work on time and you'll pass. My favorite thing about Allen is how he grades, he is not a tough grader at all. I don't write so good and all my essays have been higher than a B. His classes aren't boring so time goes by fast!", "Dr. Johnson has a doctorate in stats. Very knowledgeable, very helpful in explaining, answering questions, and assisting students. His tests are fair if you learn the concepts. He is very enthusiastic about stats and makes the learning pleasurable.", "Easy. Seems like he always had some idea of making money off of us students. which i didnt appreciate. Easy class though. just show up on time, and take notes.", "EASY CLASS but boring", "He is a good professor. I just wish he understood that if you have a hospital note, you must have been very ill.", "Rudy lost me, when in class, said that only whites can be ****.", "One of the most unhelpful teachers when it comes to teaching. If you like teaching yourself than this is the teacher for you. It isn't very helpful when you and your group have no idea what he is even teaching on. I would say never take it from him.", "He doesn't prepare for class, assigns problems that the book states are unsolvable, not to mention, when asking for help on homework, he takes off from his office at the time he told you to stop by! I don't learn a thing! He really needs to get a clue!!!", "FAVORITE PROFESSOR! SOOOO FUNNY! I would never miss a day because he makes class so interesting. TAKE HIM!!!", "No Comments", "Spears is a really great prof! His course is very focused on the readings but he lectures very well and is really funny.", "The Dostoevsky preceptorial in \"The Bell Tower\" with Mr. Verdi ranks as the best class I have taken. His opening questions brilliantly demonstrated the effectiveness of the art of asking questions, and how it is an indispensable preliminary for a close-reading of texts, especially Dostoevsky's incomparable novel \"The Brothers Karamazov\".", "No Comments", "I think Prof. McCauley is an awesome teacher. He is easy to understand and he makes Sociology interesting. I plan to take more courses with him in the futue", "He expects a lot from his student you will need to work. However he will help you if needed. He usually grades on a curve, and a very kind one at that. He's friendly and will gladly have a chat about physics and how it works, especially if it helps your understanding in the class.", "Prof. Bell is unclear with directions and is very rude. The class is supposed to focus on culture in film; however, he only focused on cinematic technique. After looking at his comments on papers, it is clear he only skimmed the paper before commenting. His suggestions on sentence structure made it grammatically incorrect and took away the meaning.", "Worst teacher ever. treats people like they are stupid, when he doesn't know anything himself. 7 people left out of 32 by the end of the year. If you want to work hard and get an F take this rude guy.", "Very kind and approachable! Never made me feel uncomfortable because I'm not a music major!", "I love Dr. Roter. He's funny and expects the very best from everyone and is a very active believe in us living up to our full potential.", "Very slow and rambles on about things that don't pertain to the lesson. Boring is the word.", "best prof at AC. easy to talk to, laid back. Knows his stuff, passionate about what he's teaching.", "He is a generally a nice guy, and I think he really does have intentions of truly helping you.", "Really enjoyed this professor. Very professional demeanor, interesting topics. Fair.", "This class overall has an incredibly high fail rate. This teacher, however, doesn't make it any easier. His lectures are confusing, and doesn't give any chances for a retake or even to earn lost marks. If you fail one quiz or one lab, just drop the course and don't waste your time; you need a 50% on every piece of assignment to pass.", "He's such a passionate professor and I loved taking his class. It's clear that he loves his area of expertise and enjoys teaching people about the Holocaust. The books and readings assigned are very interesting and most often a pretty easy read. I LOVED THIS PROFESSOR", "I've had Mr. G for several online math classes. He's the best when it comes to online math courses at GPC. His video lectures are clear and he's very fashionable. If you have a question, he responds to email promptly. A+ teacher.", "If you pay attention, his class is really easy. especially quizzes. in lecture he gives u vocab, gives the def. and then on the quiz/test, asks for 3 or 6 specific ones. and he only wants 4 or 5 sent.", "I really enjoyed this prof. He has high expectations and helps a lot too. Attendance is mandatory, as well as participation. I learned a lot in his class and have lots of respect towards his knowledge.", "Brilliant and Beautiful. Keep the blues going!", "If you're too lazy to go to class, study, this is not a course for you. If you are willing to be challenged and (god forbid) learn something, you'll do fine. As long as you work hard (go to every class and start studying for exams way ahead of time) you will be fine. Deep breaths. Relax", "great professor", "Professor Christie is a good professor. He has an old school mentality, but you learn a lot in his class. If you are lazy, you might as well not take this class. You will be challenged in this class. In the long run, you will feel more confident and your public speaking skills will increase dramatically.", "An Awesome class! I loved taking it", "Best prof for Econ. Knows his stuff well and interesting lectures", "He is also listed AS LUKE BROWN. Listen to these raters. This guy is a time bomb waiting to explode - on you, the class.

ALL BUT 10 PEOPLE DROPPED CLASS BY WITHDRAWAL DATE. 8/10 LEFT FAILED CLASS", "Hands down my favorite Biology professor! Would recommend!!! You get a lot of extra credit and its just an overall fun class. You go outside for most of your labs. Craig is so understanding!!! Everyone loves the guy!", "Has a great knowledge of poetry; that's all. Late to class almost every day. Slow talker. Only talks about old white poets. Rambles on and on, and god forbid you have a different opinion on a poem. 2 grades for the class, unless you want to write a long extra credit paper. Expects you to be interested, but you will struggle not to fall asleep.", "some one should teach him the material before they let him teach it. also some one needs to teach him HOW to teach it.", "I think the previous rater hit it: one of the few tutors who could express himself clearly, and who also tried to understand students w/o judging and putting them down.", "A nice man, but old and stuck in his ways. He talks soooo slowly that you can barely pay attention and he reads from movie review essays he wrote 10 years ago. A nice man, but makes film boring. (And I'm a film student)", "Mr. Johnson is the best teacher I have had at WWU. I had him for 124 also and he made a class that may seem boring and difficult actually kind of fun. His enthusiasm and willingness to help are contagious and he knows everything to know about math.", "i hope he reads this one day and knows that straight up, the guy almost ruined my first year. with all these professors trying to make u feel welcome, here is dr. stewart and his condescending remarks and attitude. not a good person, and not a good teacher. i tried to tell him i was struggling, he couldn't have cared less. a real egomaniac, and jer", "He's ridiculous, puts things on tests that he never goes over in class. Tests VERY unfair.. basically by the end of the semester you'll hate him intensely, so just save yourself the trouble and don't take anything he's teaching.", "He is such a sweet guy! Every second week there is a test but it is open notes!", "The benny lo's show!!! hahaha this class is absolutely amazing!! amazing bcoz u can get an A+ no sweat, just show up and listen to his dumb stories! he's cool but i'd rather study on my own than to show up for his class.", "I really liked Bob's class (he doesn't like to be called professor). He was really helpful and made things easy to understand. Most test questions are graded right or wrong, but the questions are very similar to the homework and the practice problems in class. Does things 'old school,' using papers for notes using overhead camera.", "Wonderful teacher! This class is very fun! I would recommend him to anyone!", "I had Dr. Stewart in an honours seminar a couple of years ago. He's one of the worst professors that I had the misfortune of encountering at Dal. Pompous, egotistical, inflexible and--unfortunately--not that good. That being said, if you're willing to follow his lead and you love critical theory, you'll probably be fine.", "It's a good elective class. It's not difficult and he's an interesting character. I wouldn't recommend this class to people who are wanting an intellectual, thought-provoking class (you watch movies and talk about them), but it was decent and easy. Everyone has to give their opinion, so be prepared to talk in class.", "The workload is a ton. Usually three assignments (which take me a few hours each) per week. On test weeks you have all of those plus an essay test. I don't even know how many days worth of hours I spent preparing for the tests. If you're up for a difficult course, go for it! However, if you have a pretty bulky schedule I would not recommend it.", "Prof. Vyse has done a great job sparking my interest in Psychology. He does a great job keeping the class engaged with his helpful powerpoint slides, succinct explanations of main ideas, and integration of out-of-textbook materials. He will make you work hard, but you will learn a lot. In addition, he is very kind and has a good sense of humor.", "Professor Unno is a top-quality educator. His passion for the subject is apparent in the way through which he presents the material. Incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining. I do recommend that you keep up with the reading, but if you get a little behind Professor Unno will cover the material thoroughly in class. Highly recommended!", "He rules. Totally worth it.", "Dr. Reardon is a little pompous and particular, but once you understand the writing style he likes, you'll be fine. THIS IS NOT A BLOW OFF CLASS, so don't treat it like one or you will fail...", "Really, really, really cares about his students. Always available for help. Learns student names and can actually remember how you did on tests and assignments. One of the best!", "Class is rigorous. You must read the book to do good on the quizzes. The test are not related to the book. You must go to class. You must also have a good understanding of theories pertaining to developing nations", "i heard so much bad stuff about this man. it was all lies. his class is not bad he is very intelligient and no nonsense man. u have to read the book a lot of work but easy. TAKE HIM u will get a better view about criminal justice.", "Dr. Andy is super passionate about his classes and UCD. Not for everyone, but I personally enjoyed his class. His essay prompts and grading criteria weren't ambiguous or unreasonable. Participation and attendance count- he makes that clear from day one. If you're content to not show or show up with a disengaged attitude I'd find a different class.", "He is a \"professario magnifico,\"as he claims.He knows his history so well that he doesn't need notes!U will always learn something new & he keeps u entertained.His jokes r easy 2 laugh at.As long as u take great notes & do your project,u will get an EASY A,as he gives NO homework!Dr.Chapman gives very direct answers,but make sure u speak up. =)", "worst teacher ever, hates america for some reason", "Such a good professor! His tests are straight from the notes and he pretty much tells you whats going to be on them. Makes class very interesting because he talks about his experiences as opposed to lecturing from notes. Highly recommend, and don't buy the book.", "He's a great guy! BUT.... he can be confusing and particular (HE wrote his textbook, so it also doesn't help)..often feel like things have to be HIS WAY exactly...which is frustrating. Knows a lot about music, but not always easiest to understand. Felt like I shouldn't have been so frustrated in an intro to music class, esp with prior knowledge.", "I love Dr. Phelps! if you take the time to go to his office hours, he will help you with anything you need! He helps a lot with homework and even exam questions. he does tend not to teach much during class but he makes up for it during office hours!", "Not your typical grumpy old english teacher...Very helpful and fair, very good personality, and highly approachable. If you study hard and go to class, a good grade is definitely in reach.", "Great teacher.. Just listen and do your work", "Professor Brotheron is a very cool professor. He does not expect much of u. The midterms are open book. The final is a take home.He gives 15 page term paper thats due at the end of the semester. Overall he is very funny and he makes u want to come to class.", "eaaaasy grade! just show up, didnt need to pay attention half of the time, never used the textbook and still passed, only 2 tests & lowest score is dropped. very much a story telling teacher mostly about his personal life and random things going on in class.", "Good prof., but I must say that he gets boring after telling u the same stories about his business, family, etc. SO, Ken stop wondering why people stop coming to your EIGHT O'CLOCK classes!!! All that aside, good guy, choose him and you'll have it very easy. (1midterm, 1 pro, and 1 final)", "This class is not hard to pass, but it is hard to tolerate. This man is impossible to listen to and brutal to meet with in his office. You will learn some interesting material and read some good cases but be prepared to use a thesaurus in class if you want to understand him.", "Extremely hard class and Beneski's teaching styles do not help. Recorded the lectures and studied for hours on end and could still only manage C's. Best bet is to watch videos on the topics because the tests are all applied questions. Good luck.", "HIS NOTES DON\"T HELP YOU ON EXAMS", "The class is easy, but notes are very important. A chimp could get an A on his quizes, the papers do require some effort.

I can't believe that he can teach at all!!", "One of the most amazing people I've evert met. So ENTHUSIASTIC about what he is teaching and loves/knows his stuff. Look forward to Gospel Choir every Wednesday, can't beleive we actually get credit for this class...I would take it no matter what!", "boring, couldn't be more monotone, SO NOT FUNNY", "Absolutely, by far, the WORST professor I have ever had. He's rude, he's arrogant (for no reason at all), and he is consistently 10 minutes late to class, but marks you absent if you are 1 minute late. It's his way or the highway, don't even think about making suggestions. The only way to get a good grade is to do exactly as he says, no imagination", "I took him for both my 310 and 410. He's good, the best professor in SHA. Just go to every class and take notes. He told you what the problem will be on the exam before hand. The T/F might be a bit tricky tho. I managed to got a perfect score on my last exam for 310. he only taught the basic stuff in the textbook. Recommend!", "Phil will refer to the textbook but his syllabus doesn't outline what sections of the chapter to read, so the textbook isn't a good tool to use for the class. The labs and projects are doable if you start them early. His exams are tough.", "Best instructor I have had in my four years at IU - very knowledgeable and clear communicator", "He read straight from the book. The tests were easy if you studied at all.", "I really dislike ENC classes and the semester I took ENC1102 I took 5 classes in total. Crazy to say that my favorite class this semester out of the 5 has been the ENC1102 class and it has been 100% due to Preston Allen's awesome lectures. He makes literature fun and makes you interested in what he is teaching. This professor is amazing.", "Wow, was he amazing... he taught a whole class blind-folded, just for humor. I'd also like to marry this man. So hands off.", "best class to take in the summer. he lets out class after a half hour or an hour. its pretty interesting. 2 test straight from power point notes, dont read the book just memorize all the slides. 1 group project, which is fairly easy. really nice guy. really good summer class!", "Grades easy and is very nice to all students. He gets kinda lost in his own lectures sometimes but put up with him and study along side his notes and you should get at least a B+.", "incredible professor! funny, sweet, and interesting. i admired him so much we were friends outside of the classroom. he doesn't belittle students, but he demands attention. it's about respect. he needs to do his job, you need to earn your grade with knowledge. my favorite professor in my 6 years of college. would love to get in contact w/ him again", "WORK HARD, PLAY HARD, he always says that. He's veryful and understanding,always making the class interesting.", "Youll wonder why you even bother to show up to class, which consists of personal stories and repremanding you for not having a commanding knowledge of material he never covered.", "For the class size he does a really good job. Interesting material. He plays music before each class and has a sense of humor, which makes the lectures even better.", "Best one I have ever had. Speech is hard. You have to practice, regardless of the professor. But if you do what he says, each speech you write he checks on each person individually in class. If you do exactly what he says when he gives you individual help, and you practice, you will pass easy. Hes really smart so just do what he says.", "No Comments", "Jay is a straight forward professor. He teaches for concepts not for memorization, which is helpful. He is funny and occasionally takes the day to just talk politics with his class and get to know students. There are frequent quizzes but they cover literally exactly what he taught in class. Exams are predictable if you go to class and do the work.", "Worst professor I ever had.He is rude and is not a good teacher. If you can avoid is class, do so. I dont care how long his resume is. That doesn't mean he can teach.", "This guy is really helpful. You do a lot of problems for homework, but then the next day he asks for questions. He would work the problem on the board and explain it. I actually got this stuff and I s*ck at math. Nice guy.", "No Comments", "Very melancholic, 10/30 points on projects is either pass or fail. So either 10 or 0. He will never admit he is wrong. I got an F on a project because he stopped testing when it failed a test case that WORKED! I went to see him and he would not admit that he was wrong even though I showed him Java Documentation showing he was wrong.", "Prof. Caspi is a great teacher! Kind of a smart ass sometimes but he makes class so interesting and time really flies by. I would definitely take him again! His workload is manageable and you actually learn something.", "Rob is a wonderful prof. I was somewhat intimidated going into his class, but ended up LOVING it. I have probably learned more in his class so far than any other comm course i've taken. He is extremely knowledgeable and approachable. Lots of busy work, but well worth it!", "One of the best profs at PLU. I graduated 6 years ago and looking back he is still my favorite.", "If you come to class you'll be fine. Spent a lot of time covering certain topics and then rushed through others. Very helpful if you go to his office hours, but beware, he may sit and talk to you for hours if nobody else is waiting. Knows a lot about his topic and overall is a very good professor.", "This guy is the****. This guy made taking Japanese more than just an anime thing.

But take his class only if your serious he wont sugar coat things.", "No Comments", "This class is not an easy A! You have to work for your grade. Each Wk you have to answer 2 questions about a prg or more each and give a clear explanation. Grading is #/10 for each week's assgn.

You'll be fine.", "Don't take class if you don't like group projects or presenting in front of class. The group project very difficult but you will learn a lot as well. His lectures are hilarious, but the group presentations are often tedious. Very respected teacher and will listen to you. His exams are very fair as well.", "Extremely helpful- if you are worried about taking Accounting this is the man to take it from.", "Pretty useless. Enjoys walking around the class and rambling. He doesn't do the actual marking, but his teaching assistant marks fairly (Though slowly). Doesn't give notes, and it's hard to tell what you should write down since he includes so much irrelevant content in his lectures. Take Philosophy 1200 with Flynn instead if you want", "I recommend that you read the course description because the title of the course is misleading. The books for the class are necessary. Every assignment is based on the readings. He can come off as a little rude to the skeptics. However he really tries hard to be respectful. Be prepared to hear rambling from the die hard Christians in the class.", "No Comments", "This professor is one of the best I've had at York. You rarely come across a professor who cares about his students and believes in everyone's potential. His assignments are not easy but he will walk you through them and give you a bunch of useful resources.

If you're gonna say something in class, be prepared to defend it.", "To the person who said he's rude and not a good prof, you're wrong! Sure he doesn't have patience for the people who don't try and are forever behind but that's THEIR fault! Not his! If you actually want to learn the language TAKE HIM! He's very nice, funny, and helpful if you try and he'll make sure you learn. He really loves what he teaches.", "Okay, this is hard. Reading-Jung-and-Freud-in-the first-week-hard. You read a book (or more!) a week. You go into hardcore hermeneutics and philosophy. You analyze stories until they are just a bone of word-framework.

Still, this class is not for the weak.", "nice, really helpful, lots of fun", "nice prof. hard work.", "Note how all the good ratings are based on sex or passionate . Ew, ew, ew.", "dude blows", "Midkiff is a really nice guy and doesn't make the class unnecessarily hard. He goes off on tangents sometimes but they are related to the material and he has cool stories to tell. Make sure you study the lecture notes and examples for the tests.", "He was an excellent professor. If you come in late, he will blow up your spot, but if you have some days when you cant make it to class, he is forgiving and a very respectful professor to his students. Very knowledgable in Police Science and even with Politics. I would definately take his class again.", "Good", "Kibbles is the man.

Grading is very rough.", "Take theory 3 with him!", "he knows his stuff. good class if you are interested in the subject, but if just taking to get credit it could be a pain...", "Boring monotonous lecturer.

Psychology should be an interesting course and he just doesn't present information in an interesting manner, it's almost impossible to take notes on anything he says.", "The course itself is difficult. Starts off really easy, but by the end of it you're left confused (unless you already have a background in Visual Basic coding). Scripps was funny and nice, class was usually pretty entertaining. The only downside is that when you're in lab, he isn't that helpful. He just kinda shows you what to do.", "He is one of the amazing teachers at NAIT. He has a great level of Sarcasm. His teaching method is different which make everything so easy to understand. He relates things to daily life and gives different example which makes it so easy to understand.", "Great professor. Clear on explaining Chem, have to say I learned a lot by taking his class.. I definitely recommend him", "Doc. Shreiber was my favorite prof. Took every class he taught. Played chess with him a few times. Taught me as much out of class as he did in class.", "Memorize the slides and you've got it made.", "Fairly good teacher, I enjoyed his classes. Expect to do homework for each class and don't trust your original quiz score. Not only are his multiple choice tests difficult (A&B, A&C, C&D, all of the above), but he makes the test the day before you take it and fixes any errors after you take it. Overall, nice teacher, fairly difficult class.", "Makes almost no sense, does not even come up for a breathe to allow you to ask questions. unfortunately there is no avoiding him...", "I am an international student. Dr. Pecorino is the most responsible professor I met in UA. His class is easy to understand so that I rarely read textbook after class. The class and homework is much helpful for tests. He is a very kind person. I really appreciate for his help.", "No Comments", "Tests aren't that hard but the lab reports are pretty rough. He's very fair. Grades are pretty good.", "always willing to work with students. funny, if you're smart. confusing, if you're not.", "Great guy, horrible professor. He would be a great professor for students not taking an intro course. He is very unclear in his expectations and has major mood swings. Kicked whole class out twice for things we have no control over. Probably the reason the theatre department is not strong at UA. Would take as a sr but maybe not as a fresh or soph", "AVOID. He may be very intelligent but only someone with bionic ears would be able to hear him speak. Yes, it's helpful he gives test questions ahead of time because it would be impossible to pass otherwise. Take philosophy with another professor!", "He expects a lot from students but if you go to class he is very helpful.", "Dr. Sharif comes to class with problems to work out. These problems are almost identical to the online homework. However, he often makes mistakes/gets confused with his own work. This can make the class confusing. His tests are very similar to the homework. Make sure you actually know how to do the homework and not just copy it from your notes.", "GREAT PROFESSOR! I had Potter for winter... class was fun yet you learn. Great group class discussions. he reviews everything that will be on the tests. everything in his lectures is in on the test... EASY A!!!", "If you dont cheat your an idiot. cause everybody else does.", "A very wise man.", "Dr. Irvine is honestly one of the kindest people I've ever met. His lectures are very interesting and easy to understand. Tests are really fair.", "Great professor! Very passionate about his work and genuinely cares for his students. His lectures are intriguing and thought-provoking. He has a fun personality, which makes his class all the more enjoyable. There is certainly a lot of writing to do and his tests are challenging. Open NOTES though, but not open book! So pay attention in class!", "Great guy, conveyed a lot of passion about the subject, and gave a great intro to statistics. He really understands what he is teaching and to whom, and the class is well structured, even though there was some confusion about the textbooks/DVDs. He was also very democratic as to grading exams, removing confusing questions post-exam.", "what the heck was the point in me taking it?? He is boring, and the material was pointless.", "He has a strange concept of proper academic writing. I have never gotten grades so low on papers before (B- and B+) and his identifications on his tests sometimes seem like they are asking, \"What's the third word on page 33?\"", "Great Professor! Very helpful and understanding if you miss class, as long as you keep him informed. He's very laid back, his classes are easy to understand and he's extremely helpful at all times... If you need to take SYG2000 he's the professor you need to sign up to!!! Trust me, he's the best!", "I'm not going to lie, this class is pretty hard. Granted, I got an A but I had already taken 2 regular drawing classes before and worked really hard. Jim is a good professor; pretty helpful when demonstrating homework assignments and critiques. He lets you redo the work for a higher grade, which I think is great. Manuel, the T.A., is awesome.", "mark is great. his only real flaws are that he can be a bit too smart for his own good and his clothes are all too tight.", "Peter Bloom is one of the hardest graders in the music department, but a fantastic professor. The exams are based mostly on listening so it is much more difficult for nonmusicians. It is important to ask questions, challenge him, and go above and beyond for his class. Music Majors should take a class from him before graduating.", "Bob has a fantastic understanding of calculus. Sometimes he doesn't notice if you need him to slow down or go over something again. Be assertive and he'll help.", "Extremely hard class. Class average's on the the three exams were 68, 72, and 78. Grades assignments easily and scales final grades a good amount. You will need to read a lot, but in the end, you will learn so much.", "Awesome", "This is one of the most retarded classes I've ever taken. Every single class has a video, and none of them are new than the mid-80's, most of them are terrible quality. Yet the tests are taken straight out of an outdated, redundant \"textbook\". Poor teacher.", "Very knowledgeable about the American government. Each class is a lecture and youre graded only on quizzes (submitted through angel online) and two bluebook exams. All quiz material is based on the textbook and not his lectures, so if you miss a day or a few days then just make sure to keep up with the textbook.", "Absolutely awful experience in the class. I always felt as if I was drowning and he did little to help when I asked questions. He has a way of giving you an answer without actually answering anything and leaving you more confused than when you asked the question in the first place.", "great class. he never said hed curve the grades. high score earned in teh class sets the top of hte scale and its 10% down from that for each grade. totally fair but science majors set the top. i did ok xcept for the final. shouldve studied more cuz it killed me. learned a lot tho. makes you think.", "TAKE HIM! HE REALLY LOVES WHAT HE TEACHES, AND HE'S VERY VERY FUNNY. NEVER BORING. HE'S VERY HELPFUL WITH TESTS, AND GRADES EASY. ITS HELPFUL TO READ THE CHAPTERS TO UNDERSTAND HIS NOTES. ONLY DO ABOUT 10 SEGMENTS FROM THE ENTIRE BOOK. BUT SERIOUSLY TAKE HIM!! DON'T SECOND GUESS IT. NO HOMEWORK OTHER THAN READING. TAKE HIM!", "ken was the best math teacher i have ever had. he makes math so much easier and makes learning fun! thanks ken!", "One of my favorite professors. I recommend him to all history majors (and non).", "Very knowledgeable but it seems like he doesn't care too much about students success. He pics favorites in class so its helpful to be part of Ashrae and other student groups. Not very approachable, if you don't understand something and ask a question he will sometimes talk down to you. Watch for his BPM (blinks per minute).", "Extremely tough grader and gives no breaks. Make sure you pay attention to that syllabus, because he follows it word-to-word and gives no chances... unless your dog died and you have a death certificate to prove it. Hard exams but the project is cool (for the Biological Impacts of Poverty Class). You will work your ass off in this class.", "He is good as long as you expect what the subject entails. The course is intended to cover all the basic aspects of database management systems and the professor does a satisfactory job at it. He does teach outdated technologies so beware of that. Also he will make you work hard and cares about the effort you put in the project. Overall good course", "Im so glad he is leaving.", "Nice guy. Good teaher. Funny. Cares about students learning the material and succeeding in life. Highly recommend.", "Professor Patierno is easily one of the best professors I've ever had. He's helpful, kind, polite, and extremely knowledgeable. All of his tests are made up directly from his notes, so as long as you show up to class every day and study your notes, you'll get an A. I highly recommend taking one of his classes -- you'll have fun and learn a lot.", "One of the greatest teachers I have ever had. Tarkow is able to take student's comments at the beginning of class, and weave his lecture around those points. The discussion is always deep, but never tangential. He has a wonderful classroom presence. He's a picky grader, but he gives you all the tools in class you could ever need to do well.", "one of the best professors in business. also a real accountant. and makes it impossible to fail.", "Very passionate professor and very accomplished. He expects the best out of students but beware of his extra times in labs counting fecal pellets. He is very clear when he lectures but please please pleasee record him or write everything he says. Time consuming course but very rewarding. I really look up to him and respect the man.", "Good course! Not terribly difficult. Just make sure if you take the DE course, you know the assignments really well for your final. And don't bother with the lecture notes too much. Prof won't give any answers away, but still very helpfuL!", "This guy complains about everything. What a clown shoe.", "Awesome teacher. Very good at breaking the monotony, especially since he teaches math, yet you still learn a ton. Only down side is very long homework assignments, which aren't checked in depth. Tests aren't too bad. Overall, one of Duquesne's finest.", "Prof. Young is awesome! He really cares about math and his students. He offers extra credit on canvas so be sure to do that for some gimme points. Be sure to do the homework each week and his tests aren't really that difficult as long as you practice. Young makes math fun and is very funny! You will definitely enjoy his class.", "Okay seriously don't buy the book - you won't ever use it! It's a pretty easy class. He's a great guy and he explains everything a couple times very clearly so if you go to class you'll be fine.", "He's really helpful and if you talk to him and ask him questions he will go out of his way to help you. He wants everyone to succeed his class. All you have to do is ask. He's always helpful outside of class also.", "He's the most magnificent professor ever. He's a genius. He is dedicated to helping you out, and is just excellent at his job. His class may not be easy, but he is willing to explain things and help you out, as much as you're willing to be helped. Best professor at Denison!", "This class was way easier than I thought, he lays out clear guidelines for what you need to do to pass, and let's you decide how you will do. Every week he has a quiz, which you must be present for to be able to get your points (that build up to an A), but as long as your getting a decent grade, you can leave early. He is very willing to help.", "Absolutely the hardest prof. I've had. Very difficult exams. Too bad he is a must-take.", "Sure he might be a bit rough, but he explains the ins and outs of design. From Sequence Diagrams, Use Cases to Screen Designs. He's able to point the flaws and mistakes when you submit a document.", "A caring, loving, easy going, and funny/ He is by far a great teachers there no way to fail his class no WAY............", "Extremely nice guy. He is very old and gets confused easily however. Class can drag but is very easy and you only have to do a few papers and some homeworks. Hes very easy going and such a cute old man!!!", "Worst professor ever. Told me i was bound to get a F when i could not withdrawal from the class.99% of the students could not do the work due to blackboard outage. how am i suppose to pass it with no work to be graded? DO NOT TAKE HIM.", "He saved my life ! I came to the university in 1979 I had just gotten a GED and was enrolled in the talent devlopment program. Prof Trav , as everyone called him became my friend - more than anything he listened to me and accepted my short comings. Made me feel I belonged and I was worthy of an education .very dear man to me !", "He's okay...a little nitpicky with the papers. Nice guy, but I dread taking him again b/c I know there'll be several papers involved. But he did take us on a day trip to NY; that was pretty cool.", "Totally unhelpful and difficult to reason with. Overall very poor quality professor. Very disappointing considering the high quality of Seneca College's other professors.", "No Comments", "Eierman is a nice guy. He is willing to help and answer questions all the time. Hard to follow most lectues in class so reading on your own is essential to get an A or B. Overall good teacher if you are willing to put effort in.", "Very boring. Pretty easy grader though. Quizzes straight from book. Lectures straight from book. Get a good hour or so nap in his class.", "Katz is the man! He is the best teacher I have ever had on any level. He is funny, knowledgeable, open, challenging, genuinely interested in his students, and everything else that you would ever want from a professor. He will quickly learn everyone's name and make them feel at home. Do your reading. You will not regret it. He will connect it later.", "Lots of workshopping in a really mature and supportive atmosphere. Always makes himself available for extra help. Encouraging!", "Good professor. Explanations are clear. He's very methodic and strict. There are a lot of programming projects and the grading is though (got an F on a project because of a debug statement I left on the code). Tests are long, hard but are basically about what's mentioned in class. Lecture notes suck, so don't miss the lectures.", "Pretty funny but odd guy, has been teaching here for 50 years. Insensitive but kind-hearted; he wanted us to call him Uncle Ron. the class isn't easy, but he helps you out w/ some extras and stuff.", "very strange class. you read books about nuns and monks fantasizing about jesus and weird things like that. if you like taking the literal meaning of weird religious texts very seriously, this class is for you. mcauliffe has mood swings. sometimes he is easy and nice, sometimes he is condescending and makes you feel like a jerk for not reading.", "i love the class", "Professor Hu lectures in an understanding matter; writes all the steps to the problem. Daily homework that is optional. It is to your benefit to do the homework. Three quizzes per week and the problems are from the homework. Fair and easy grading system. Recommended to do the homework. Tells you what is on the test and is similar to the homework", "Geib is pretty easy, but his lectures are really really boring. SUPER nice guy though. Easy class to take if you can keep from falling asleep.", "He's kinda cute, and funny. He tells lots of random stories and made the class really fun. If you're going to take this class, take it with him!", "Took this class in Spring of 2013. Usually, I hate night classes and anything with a three hour lecture, but he was good about making the class interesting and ended class if he finished early. Almost everything is gone over in lecture, with just a few book readings to reinforce the topic. There is one paper, but it's no big deal.", "Can be interesting if you enjoy the topics. The lectures can be long and boring. The class itself seems easy but beware he is a tough grader. Thought I did well for the class but ended up with less.", "Very hard class. Does not use textbook. Wants you to learn to derive formulas you will not ever use; tests impossible; DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!", "No Comments", "Awesome and funny teacher, repeats himself so that everyone understands which helps tremendously.

You'll miss a lot.", "Best teacher I ever had", "Boring as heck...nice guy though, easy grader", "Peters was good but the class was a lot of work. For an LAC class, I spent more time doing tests and homework than for my major classes. There are 6 tests and they are all online (30-40 MC with a strict time limit), but the final is in class (100 multiple choice). There are also 4 article reflections throughout the semester that took a lot of time.", "Taking Physics 105 from anyone else would be a mistake.", "good for students who have had calc before, if not see him during office hours. do the maple labs right or they will screw you.", "I hate him. He's an ****. So damn picky and mean to his class. He also thinks he is so much better than his students. Don't be scared to challenge this guy. He deserves it.", "He is the best design teacher ever!!!! He knows what he's talking about and makes you feel good about your work (as long as you have it done). He only teaches Design I &II so take him while you can!!!", "On the one hand (men), Greek grammer is extrememly boring, especially the Machen text, on the other hand he is a super cool guy. MMelghh. Uhhhh... okay.", "A very nice guy but so boring. too much reading per night, 20 dreadful pages and more. tries to trick us. midterm was hard intentionally so people will drop his class, final review was given but final was too tricky. easy paper to write. sarcastic rude and does help students. i felt that i shouldnt gotten a high grade.", "not too hard, but can get boring after a while, focuses mostly on what he knows", "HORRIBLE class! night class and he kept us the whole 3 hours everytime. Class was boring. could get done in 1 hour what we did in 3. Must go to every class, takes attendence and partipation.

Down to earth, when ure with him u never feel like u;re talking to authority you feel like you';re talking to a friend whom you respect and who cares about what you say.", "Probably one of tbe best teachers at McGill BUT his tests are very hard. Be prepared to put a lot of time in this course. Make sure you understand the material well (do as many previous midterms and finals as you can).

If you do the homework and take notes in class, you will be able to overcome the confusion most students experience.", "Great teacher, interested in his students and willing to take time to help.", "Dr. Farmen is by far the most practiced and advanced prof I've ever studied under. His understanding of human behavior, motivation, and inner-workings is truly a great resource when studying Psychology. I will use what he's taught me every day!", "I loved his class! I think Prof Shangraw is amazing, very knowlegeable and concise. Tough grader, but what do you expect? Its a tough field. Very helpful. He knows his stuff, plus a VERY nice guy, with hot daughters.", "Ercoli is the BEST! He's so laid back, and free spirited. He really gives you the room to be creative, instead of always trying to change your ideas like other teachers. He has lots of cool books, and can tell you about really cool relevant things...just ask him. Def. take him for Prob. Solving. NOT CLARA", "His tests are pretty picky and his lectures are boring. Take good notes and study for days before the test!!!", "I love this guy! He's hilarious and extremely intelligent. I've never had a professor explain the material so well.

Next yr's gonna be his last so take him while he's still here. He's a great connect 4 letters of recc! As for the class, its straightforward & makes it super easy on us.

I'm not sure that there was even a teacher in the room most of the time. really off track this semester... would have rather had seman and learned something", "One my favorite professors so far.

I highly recommend!!!! :D", "What can I say about this man? He is nice, but the course was a waste of time. Very disorganized and confused. He only stresses your final paper in my opinion. Don't buy the books. For some odd reason, he grades too harshly. If you don't write like him or agree with his points-expect a C+. What a semester. I did learn how to master you tube though!", "best teacher...such a cute guy and very smart and nice! knows his math", "my best non engineering professors, loved the course", "No Comments", "Horribly mean teacher who only criticized his students, couldn't even remember who the twenty people in his class were, made us where name tags, and had harder course material in a freshman seminar than upper level classes!", "Great professor, not the easiest grader - but definatley worth it - really cares about his students and puts in a great effort - highly recommend! - great man", "Perkins is the sweetest man ever!

Professor piqued my interest in India and WWI, WWII and inter-war period.", "I took Prof. Hu Summer '14. He is a great teacher. Very willing to help. Gives tons of examples during the lecture. He does have an accent, but you get used to it. Very kind and nice teacher. He gives tons of HW, but that's how you learn math anyway. Quizes everyday, Mon,Wed,Fri were group, Tue,Thu were individual. On test you can bring small note.", "The guy was an arrogant conceited jerk and the entire MBA class full of adults all had that opinion of him. He deducted participation points even if you had to leave the room to go to the bathroom! One person left the room due to having a coughing, fit and he deducted points! He is in love with himself and loved to brag about his BMW to the class.", "He's a nice guy, kept me interested even with my lack of sleep. hard grader and tests are difficult, but still a good class and professor.", "Interesting material but Beneski is really dry. He has a few good jokes, but the material is just so hard and it is hard to focus. Anatomy will take up your life so be prepared to study hard. It is doable.", "Brannon is a boring teacher. You have to write down everything that he says, it will be on the test. what you read in the book is not discussed in class, and will be on the test.

He is very respectful of everyone and gets across a lot of information in a short amount of time. Great class!!", "Ian is a wonderful professor!

You have to put the time into reading and understating the content. It is not a difficult class but you must put an effort into it. I highly recommend his online class.

He expects you to read the material prior to class and loves relevant questions. Read, come to lectures (daily!) and you'll get an easy A.", "OChem 2 is a difficult class. . Dr.G Focuses more on the mechanism of the reactions and few problems here and there. Although this may not be efficient for most students, he really wants you to succeed.

I can't stress how much information I retained after taking this class. I highly recommend taking this class.", "No Comments", "This was one of the most useful classes I have ever taken. It helped me learn the great variety that the field has to offer. Dr. Langley is smart and funny. He rewards effort.

He's a wonderful professor and as long as you do the work .", "He is very nice prof. Clear, precise and explains very well. Answer your questions seriously. Exams are bit hard but within the material he covers. He is very responsible and respect students well. Best prof. at McGill.", "Dr. Fonseca has an interesting teaching style. Maybe it's the fact that this course is 4 courses in 1, but it was very quick and sometimes hard to keep up with. Despite that, Dan the man is a very effective teacher.

There was no group work this semester, unlike some of the other comments indicated. There were 3 tests, all multiple choice and short answer.

I'll bet not from anyone who has practiced. Prof. Frey does a terrific job of preparing his students to practice law, which is what the majority of his class is there for. His contract theory served me well on the bar exam and in the eight years since. Tough? Yes. But excellent.", "No Comments", "Professor Bracken does not deserve the bad rep he gets.

I'll never forget that class.", "If you're very into learning oceanography, TAKE HIM! He gives vocab quizzes and his test are from the handouts and stuff he writes on the board.

He will not inform you regularly about how your doing in the class.", "He is awesome! Enough said. I took him for Juvenile Justice and Criminology. He is great. He knows what he is talking about. He teaches from his experience as a police chief...not by the book.", "BEST BMS TEACHER! Tries to have fun with the class, and still gets the material across. He's GREAT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I learned a lot from this class.", "but he is lecturing on molecular bio and biochem stuff 3) he is asking us all mo bio and biochem questions even though the prereq for this class is only genetics.

If you ask for help he just confuses you more.", "The 7A class may be a bit more detailed. Note down what he tells you to note down, or everything and buy the book. Don't be lazy on this one. Get the A. 2 tests, one easy paper. Open note/book although sometimes hard to find answers", "Don't miss his quiz's, but do not worry he warns you in advance. We had to buy 5 different novels, i suggest getting them early because many student had a hard time finding them...toward the end of the session.

Best professor in the department.", "he's a great guy a nice teacher and his class is kinda easy if you take notes and read the book.. i took him for lab and it was really easy as far as for lecture he's really nice and will take time to help you out of class but he is a theorist and most of the answers for the homework in the book he made are wrong, very unorganized.", "He was really good at explaining everything and we always had the chance to ask questions without feeling like he was going to snap at us. Class requires you to think more openly and it helps to understand the criminal justice system better. Take Him!!!!", "Terrible. Just god awful. I have always understood math but this man just ruined it for me. \"Quizzes\" are huge and don't even go along with the homework.. No matter what, avoid this teacher. He's extremely rude and talks down to his students. Overall just a mean guy", "I really liked this teacher, and his lectures were really interesting. The tests are easy if you take notes . You don't really need the book if you take good notes in class, and if you need help the TA's are the ones you need to talk to. He gave us the question beforehand so we could write an outline for the exams.", "When i took Fin 15.401 was called Finance Theory. He is funny and gives amazing lectures . The Exams are a little Hard but manageable. He gives an Excelent Foundation of Managerial and Corporate Finance . He leads the Laboratory for Financial Engineering thats awesome. Is a Finance Master mind", "Never seen such moran professor. He should dismiss from the shool.", "DONTtake his classes,he is about70-80yrs old prob half blind,uses a cane,has a tube through his throat,you wont be able to hear past the 2row.the books were very hard to understand(for me at leastEthics by Frankena was the mostconfusing)i cant tell you enough DONT TAKE HIS CLASS!im warning you nowHE SHOULD BE RETIERD!btw i am an A-B studentNEVER D!", "Very helpful teacher with good intentions but boring as crap! Hands out notes, so theres no need to go to class, except he takes attendence and then makes you sit in class while he reads the notes to you!!! BORING! Test are hard.", "He made me dislike interculural films. He is rude & cuts students off when he doesn't agree with what his students said. I would NOT take this class. He does not explain himself well enough for students to understand. There are online chats and discussion board topics that are due every class. Also weekly quizes and 1 page papers due each class.", "One of the best teachers/lecturers I've ever had! Matheson is the bomb, and very considerate of the students he's teaching. Take some time over weekends to watch physics movies online-- grabbing the conceptual picture will help tons!", "I don't know why Larry's getting such a bad rap... sure he's not the best teacher around, but he's a nice guy and will amaze you with his sports knowledge. Just do all the readings (which are mostly interesting) and write everything you know on the essay tests and you'll be fine. The baseball salary arbitration paper is really fun. Not a hard class", "He is awesome", "great guy", "Amazing bowling instructor! I wasn't a good bowler & I made so many gutters, until I took Professor Martin. I never scored 3 digits my entire life, until I took his class. Now, I rarely hit the gutter. Spares & Strikes are easier to achieve because of him. You'll learn to keep score & he gives you the answers to the final exam on the first day :-)", "Prof Lesk is an amazing speaker. His lectures are clear, concise, and very interesting. He grades fairly, but not too rough. I think the negative feedback for him on here must mostly be from people who didn't do their readings and consequently got poor marks. He doesn't put up with offensive opinions, but encourages discussion.", "He is such a nice guy,willing to help in anyway.Makes learning fun with his jokes, and also gives you tricks on how to learn most of the material.Puts up power points and drops a lot of low grades, keeps top 10 quizzes. Totally recommend.Great teacher!", "he is a schmuck/very unhelpful..he knows what he is doing but very negative and wants to scare EVERYone out of the graphic design program!", "This Professor is awesome! He's so helpful and he's really interested in helping students learn. He encourages discussion inside and outside the classroom and he teahes you how to look at subjects from a new angle", "Beneski is a very smart man and really knows his stuff about anatomy, but he is not the best at teaching it. He lectures very monotone and it can be hard to keep up with so I recommend recording the lectures because you need to know literally every little detail for the exams. You need to put at least 10 hours in a week if you want a good grade.", "James Dayglow is an absolute legend.", "Been a few years so see if his policy is still the same. A quiz each chapter - No Midterm - get an A average on the quizes and he'll use that in place of the Final - a long paper. Best class participation ever. Since quizes mean so much everyone reads and is prepared for class. I haven't been in a class since where I felt everyone took in so much.", "He takes his job and class seriously so he doesn't joke or waste time. For the final you literally get attacked by him (tackled, slapped, hair pulled, choked)But he really wants to prepare you and make you use the skills he taught you. Take it if you really want to learn to defend yourself but don't expect this to be an easy 1 credit class!!", "He is a great teacher and probably the only good philosophy professor we have. Another surprising thing is that he makes the final paper fun. Anyone at all interested in philosophy should take a course with him.", "My highschool guidance counselor told me that he is the best teacher at Bergen. He is great and makes class interesting and real.", "Dr. Lynn is a very engaging speaker but sometimes he is not always appropriate. During a lecture on ethics he made us pull out our phones and show him our Facebook pages. He said he wanted to check them for ho pictures. It is not his business what we do on our personal time. This was during a lecture on ethics.", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Don't ask questions, he will ridicule you.", "Great course. amazing prof", "Dr. S is getting a bad wrap. I must admit I graduated a few years ago now. Fact is the reason he gave up making class \"managed\" is because he got so many complaints about his class being to hard. It really broke his spirit. I am currently a Ph.D. student in neuroscience, and he prepared me well. You have to get on his level and listen.", "Sounds like he's a great teacher in the class room, however online is the worst grading rubric in the world. He gave me a 0 for an assignment out of 15, which I did complete in it's entirety. Not even one point for trying. I would NEVER recommend him for an online class.", "He doesn't answer questions, and won't meet with students unless you submit your questions to him first. Over 60% of the class has dropped out. He has insulted students, and doesn't grade fairly. I told him I was having trouble on quizzes. He told me to read the book. He is an embarrassment for DMACC. Don't take his class.", "AWESOME PROFESSOR His class are tough be expected to read and analyze the material because the questions on mid terms and final exams are not going to directly jump out at you unless you actually read read the material. He is a honest person and he is understandable unlike some professors so just be honest with him and you will do fine", "Inspiring, helpful, understanding, talented, etc. His writing classes were amazingly helpful to me.", "I had Kumpf for both Latin and Greek. Super nice and a fair grader. He gets off topic a lot, which sometimes makes things confusing, but he's always willing to work with you, until you understand the material. S", "He was a horrible teacher. You must avoid him if you can. His exams are hard because they have tricky questions. He comes off as a very approachable guy, but beware. Gives you problems from the book to study yet none of them relates to the probs on the exams. He'll try to help you during the office hour, but still doesn't help. Goes WAY too fast!", "I can only speak to the Arabian Nights course -- the best course I have taken so far at SFU. The enthusiasm and passion were contagious. There was no exam but only a journal of responses instead -- everyone was into it", "This may be the most repugnant instructor of my entire education.", "Best prof on campus.", "Latin classes here at Utah State are amazing. Professor Damen makes you feel like family. I can't imagine my college experience without his intellect and help. He truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. If you ever get a chance take his classes. They might be difficult, but the knowledge you will gain is outstanding.", "Great teacher. I am terrible at Math and bombed the first exam. Mr. Moliassa worked with me through out the semester and I ended up with a good grade in the class. ATTEND CLASSES. Don't give up on this class.", "he is so sweet and helpful. one of the best prof at bergen! he really cares about his students. not alot of work but study for tests.", "Found this class irritating. Everyday he would tell us to read something and then the next day he would make US discuss it. Exam was HELL, he wanted you to memorize specific non-important quotations, it seemed. Found him arrogant but I don't doubt he has great analytical skills, which I picked up in the class. Too much content on race issues for me", "He is excellent! He knows his stuff, makes it interesting, shows ads and example throughout the semester to make it interactive. All-in-all he is great professor and I hope I get to take him again.", "He is a very good teacher and fair marker. Just do your cases (home works). You will not have more then two cases for all semester. Do not skip his classes, he does not like it.Also, try to participate in class. This subject is stupid, but the teacher is OK", "Don't have to go to class all the time. Although the marks are entirely exam based which kind of sucks. He seemed like he'd rather be somewhere else than teaching students. Helpful and open to criticism", "Great teacher if you pay attention and you are actually interested in philosophy. Most of the kids in my class who failed never paid attention. You must be a good note taker and take notes about what he says, NOT what he writes on the board. Great class though. Very useful, really makes you think.", "Dr. Harvey is a brilliant professor and a compassionate one towards students. The first professor I had that actually took time and effort to find online resources and material, which was grade A quality, for the course instead of getting us to spend $$$ on textbooks. Lecture slides are posted, exams are heavy on material but can be done with study", "Excellent prof. Explains everything extremely well, knows how to relate simple examples to complicated topics. Gives easy tests and no HWs. As long as you read and take class notes you have nothing to worry about. Highly recommend this teacher.", "Excellent professor. Always willing to help. His tests are a little tough, but he is very easy with grading everything else and gives a lot of credit for in class participation.", "Only grades are papers and exams, he is a tough grader! You have an extra credit opportunity where you can type three papers, but you can only get a total of ONE combined. All tests are on quizlet but you only get 40 minutes for 40 questions. I thought the class was super boring. You have a total of 6 papers. Attendance is required.", "One of the best professors in the department! He really cares about his students and is a fair grader. He did require two hours of volunteering outside of class each week, but it was enjoyable. He knows what he's talking about and always wants to help you understand.", "Fisher seems like an articulate, personable guy and his lectures are interesting and simple to grasp. That being said, he's condescending in office hours and his tests never reflected the concepts he stressed in class. It's definitely not the easy elective people make it out to be, but it's probably the most interesting higher level biology class.", "I adore him, he is the nicest, sweetest, old man alive. His class is great, all the presentations so far are interesting and fun. Like everyone else says, an easy and enjoyable class. Lots of chocolate and arts and crafts involved.", "Worst teacher I ever had. Has no clue what he is talking about. He teaches a concept, decides it is wrong and reteaches it again but tests you on the \"wrong one\" I took Advanced Honors Physics in high school and got an A but struggled to get a C in this class. I basically self-taught in this class.", "Ruhi can be intimidating when it comes to asking questions in class. It seems like he gets frustrated for you needing clarification. This class would have been a lot harder if I had not taken AP Stats in high school. Although, the examples he gives in class give a good insight to the tests. He always gives a formula sheet, too.", "No Comments", "Darren Hynes is a horrible prof. He makes going to class useless because he just stands up front and rambles incoherently. Theres no notes or structure and when asked to explain something he does so by responding with something else that you cannot understnad. If you have to take this course, do so with a different prof!", "boring class, but really easy", "technical", "Excellent professor! This is the second course that I took with Professor Schnarre (intentionally) Very fair and keeps you entertained.", "Lots of reading. You are expected to keep up and be engaged in class. Participation matters to this professor - so if you don't speak up, don't expect to do well. The curve is a bit strange, a 94 is an A-. Overall, Dee asks you to think about some important ideas and engage in a high level of discourse.", "Difficult an inaccessible teacher. He is one of the teachers that don't care about students. mean and inconsiderate. very boring lectures, stupid quizzes. Find another teacher if you can!", "He makes the class very interesting and he is an easy grader, great elective drugs and behavior and easy midterm/final exams.", "little homework,no tests,just mid-term and final", "No Comments", "Very good professor: kind, intelligent, informed, knowledgeable, and committed. This was a very enjoyable course. I would definitely recommend his courses.w", "this was so boring i could not help but fall asleep. this is not an easy class and you will need to memorize EVERYTHING.", "Do NOT buy the parkin book! you will never use it. do do the homework on a regular basis and do go to CL. It all really helps.", "He knows his statistics. Tests are always multiple choice, and reading is a must. This guy will help you out with ANY real world info.", "Thought the course was okay, but somewhat boring. We seemed to always discuss surface issues and not the real deep philosophical stuff. Jeff is a good scholar - one of his articles was part of the syllabus, and it was a great article. But, we really didn't get into the theory behind it - i.e. cultural reproduction. Could have been better.", "There are only 4 projects, which you will get either get 100%, 66%, or 0%, and 3 tests that are almost impossible to pass. HORRIBLE PROFESSOR", "I had Jurs for my chem freshman seminar. The class was possibly the most pointless ever. Assignments were easy, but too much so. Grades are partially attendance-based, so go to the beginning of class, sign in, and get out of there when you find an excuse.", "Best professor I've had at UVU. If you show up, pay attention, participate, and read you'll learn a lot and get a good grade.", "Spaced out guy.", "He definitely prepares you for 111b. Make sure you read the book ahead of or after he lectures on this topic. The book definitely explain concepts alot better. Reason why I feel he prepared me was because he tests you on every detail explained in the book which is needed in understanding java so you can program fun stuff in 111b.", "(Language & Culture)This class was great. Be patient through the linguistics and the culture part is awesome! Be warned: you will only get an \"A\" if you earn it completely. Read everything asked of you and do the workbook assignments. Brian's hilarious and extremely fair. Very fun class. Highly recommended.", "Class material very interesting and relevant. Very approachable professor. Very encouraging and nurturing environment. Readings and assignments are not overwhelming. It helps to have an interest in the topics covered to really get the most out of the class. Highly recommended professor.", "No Comments", "Milner is a great teacher and knows his stuff. BUT he is the most disorganized person ever. NEVER responds to emails. will admit he read them, but doesnt respond. He changes dates around, forgets what he assigned and when things are due - easy class, but I never knew what was going on!", "Mixed feeling. He is really nice. But his voice is just too quiet and I cannot follow from time to time because of that!", "His tests are way too complicated and he doesn't respond to e-mail messages.", "Take another teacher. He'll do problems in class & make sarcastic comments about how much faster he can do them. Tests much harder with trick questions than other sections & u don't get to use formula sheet on final. You might learn more in his class but you are unlikely to get in A unless you've had AP chem and grading criteria not clear.", "Said all deadlines were FLEXIBLE and then wouldn't let us turn in a late homework assignment. Makes it difficult to succeed in his class.", "VERY energetic and fun!", "The information in this class is pretty useless, but all notes and readings are posted online, so no need to go to class or buy a textbook. He curves all the exams even when he says he doesn't, and offered a short extra credit paper at the end of the class. Not the most helpful professor but easy overall!", "very knowledgeable. hw from the textbook doesnt really help with preparing for tests. getting the solutions manual will really help (several of our problems couldnt be solved or had errors in the solution). he made a lot of mistakes working problems in class which made it easy to get confused. his multiple choice are pretty tough. Overall great guy", "out to get you. If he doesn't like the topics of your papers you might as well give up!", "He is a good teacher, extremly knowledgable. If you are not a Christian Jesus loving Southern, he will make sure you know what a bad person you are. Very outspoken on religous views. (a bit innappropriate at times) But you will learn a lot from him. Easy A if he stays in a good mood through the semester.", "First off, he is definitely NOT hot. EW!!! Secondly, he is a decent teacher, but he picks favorites and makes it blatantly obvious who those individuals are. His criticisms on labs/exams are harsh, rude, and not helpful. In one word: arrogant.", "He is an AWAESOME teacher and I loved the class especially since I love plants to much, he is dedicated and very knowledgeable", "Best Professor! he's so helpful, knows his material, makes class fun and project fun. He's not hard at all and his lectures are great! you will learn from him. Easy A...", "Dr. Sumner is the most worthless professor I've ever had. He never replies to emails, just gossips during class and doesn't help when requested. I honestly don't know how he's been teaching as long as he has.", "Dean for test paper, everything u confused he can explain clearly. He is a humourous guy and always sign for attendants for some special time(Don't miss the class at the mid-time). Course is not that hard, focus on details and tricks on the calculation he prepared.", "Dr. Gongaware was a very good professor. His tests are all online and only two one page papers. Lectures can get long and boring but some of the material is interesting. Just do the review guides and you'll be fine.", "really easy and friendly teacher. students take advantage of him all the time, but there is no way you will NOT pass the class. He doesnt require you to be better but he will know who you are and your name by the second class.", "Terrible teacher. I expected better from the head of the department, but every class he decides to display his knowledge about the topic and branch off to random topics. After all that he expects you to know what he meant to talk about. Also a mean guy in general. Very inconsiderate when a student was very sick and needed to switch final time.", "anyone who complains about Briggs is an idiot. Yes there are papers and tests. ITS A COLLEGE COURSE MORON, not a tiger schulmans. Of course you have to do some work besides just tai chi.Besides, he makes the tests and the papers as laid back and easy as he possibly can. You could have written about anything and he would have accepted it. Great guy!", "Pletcher is a brilliant professor, but I don't look forward to his class. He runs our freshman seminar 102 like a POSC 300-level. He also read student essays; only accept re-writes and averages the two grades. Overall, interesting guy, but demanding all around, with some ineffective policies.", "Incredibly hard at first but becomes the most useful class anyone in the field could take. The way he prepares his students for Post Grad life is ten times better than most of his colleagues in the Fitzwater Center. Not a bad thing to say about him and do not take anything personally.", "Professor very knowledgeable. Assignments complemented lectures. Makes environmental health and safety a interesting course to take.", "I'm a senior set to graduate in the winter of 2016. The first time I took HUMM 3301 I received an F. The closer I got to graduation the more I wanted to retake the course in order to get rid of that F. So I decided to register for the online version of the course. Biggest mistake of my life. I've never been more stressed out over a course.", "Had him for eMac my freshman year of art college. Great teacher, super helpful and knowledgable of what he's teaching. Class has a lot of freedom, but also just enough structure. Great lecturer as well. Highly recommend Jason!", "He has a lot of heart and loves to teach. He will make you an outstanding classical guitarist and a great lead guitar player if you play steel guitar too. Just be open to his teaching method and put in the hours.", "I really stuggle at math and he made me even more aware of the fact that I have a hard time. I cried everyday that I was in that class because he was so hard and I could never understand what he was teaching. He does not explain the material well AT ALL!! I had to withdraw!! It was a horrible experience.", "Great Professor!! Will be taking him again!!", "Dynamics can be hard, but J. Parker is definitely the guy to take. His test problems are so much better than Freeman's. He grades easy too. Do your hw and you will be fine.", "Professor Peters is a good teacher. He is passionate about politics and has interesting class discussions. His lectures can get long and boring. He does a good job of not letting his personal views get in the way of his teaching. His quizzes can be difficult and he can be a tough grader. You definitely have to work for your grade.", "he's great. very clear, very helpfull and fair. he knows his stuff very well. he's great! just great! merci :)", "Wouldnt take this class ever again", "Chaney was an absolute ray of sunshine! His Film 100 class is fun and chill. I had him for an 8am and every morning he made waking up for that class a little bit easier. We only had two projects and spent a lot of time talking about and watching films. He loves when people talk in his class and he is very excited about what he does!", "Made people almost cry in class because of how he went about criticizing people's papers. He just wanted students to write papers he thought was correct, rather than write from their own opinions. He needs to learn how to criticize constructively, instead of blasting people for trying their best. Good intentions, but really bad.", "Loved the class! Very interesting material. Dr. Langely is very funny and entertaining. Easy A if you show up to class and take notes!", "AWESOME teacher! He is great! I totally recomend him and I wish he taught more courses. The teaches are a bit nervewrecking, depending on your lab instructor; luckily I got a great one! Take his class!", "Very unclear lecturer. He messes up the dates often and his lack of clarity makes it extremely hard to understand what he is lecturing about. I recorded lectures and still had problems figuring out what he was talking about. Exam was easy. He gives you 5 of the final multiple choice quesions at the start of each class.", "Funny Russian accent and cool guy. Great examples in physics for calculus problems. Found lectures really interesting using MAPLE programs in class. Very helpful in office hours and was available outside of class for questions. Really nice math prof.", "There is no doubt in my mind that Coleman was the most influential professor I ever had. I was a student of his 12 yrs ago & I'm still in awe of the learning experience I had in his courses. Anyone afraid of hard work, thinking critically, or extremely needy should probably forget about this dynamic prof.", "Great professor. Study abroad in Greece, he turned a class into a Vacation. Has a passion for the classics, and he displays that in lecture. He's also a really down to earth man, glad I took his class!", "Tim is a great guy and loves what he does. I had him for FYE and he has different dynamics from the other teachers. He was never very clear on any assignment but loves what he does and always wants to keep on track in class. Easy", "Take his class if at all possible! I feel that any artist who does not have a chance for the \"experience\" is really missing out. Too many teachers set creative boundries, and Steve does not know the meaning of creative boundries. He will give you more information than you can handle. If you complete the work and show that you have not held back...A", "Great teacher!! Math is one of those subjects I hate the most, but prof. Burns helped me understand it in matters of minutes made it much more simpler. Thanks professor Burns.!! We need more professors like you. :)", "I took all three of his classes. They are pretty difficult... however he is VERY helpful and will even help you with the questions during the test (sometimes gives answers). I would recomend him to anyone!", "this is agood instructor--the best one teaching type. the others are dull and boring. u can tell he really cares about and knows type and design. and yeah he's a little hot. kinda strict about getting work done and hates excuses but its usually managable. really learned alot how to work with type and be a good desniger.", "Easiest class I've ever taken. If you know how to do the bare minimum in Microsoft Office, you can get an A. Don't bother showing up on time, because he sure as hell doesn't. He makes you print out your assignments, so be prepared to spend money on the print service. He's old and confuses himself a lot, so be prepared to teach yourself.", "I took his EH101 class and he is very clear and concise as to what he wants your essay to be constructed as. He is very helpful, and although his teaching can get extremely boring, it is helpful when you sit down and write your essay. My writing has improved by taking his class.", "No Comments", "A very smart professor, a good lecturer. If you need help, just ask, he's very helpful and friendly if you approach him.\r He honestly wants you to do well and to teach well so if you come to learn, you shouldn't have a problem.", "Easy course, don't bother too much with the tapes. Read the text, and practice with assignments. Exam is all the assignments put together.", "On-line Class: His is very Ccear with requirements. This class is not a soft class, but is not extreme. This class can be done, while taking other ACCEL classes.", "Shane is hilarious and really good at explaining concepts. You need to practice your code and show up to every lecture. His tests were really challenging compared to the labs. He's more than willing to help you if you need it. There are SL sessions you can attend with a student tutor WHICH ARE FREE! Will supply duo-tangs for labs :) Thanks Shane!", "I had Dr. Brooks for BSC 1010 and 1011. He is very knowledgeable in what he teaches. On the exams, his word choices are very tricky. So when you're studying for the exams, make sure you are very certain in what you're studying otherwise the wording could potentially trick you. He gives unannounced quizzes so study before each lecture.", "I got a B!!! I got a B!!! For the first time in my life I understood Math. Prof. Quereshi is very helpful! Take him if you have a very difficult time with numbers. Just be sure to do homework and ask questions if you need help. :) YEY QUERESHI!!!", "Once upon a time, there was a professor named Michael Martone. ONE DAY, he got a motley class full of EN 200 students. Some dropped and some stayed, and those that stayed had a glorious time in his kingdom. Once the semester was over, the students and their good grades lived happily ever after. TAKE HIM IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY! The End.", "No Comments", "Easy Professor no test no quizes just 1 paper. The papaer is very easy you can just make it up and get a A. Watch good flicks in this class. Take this professor for an easy A or B", "Jason is the best!!! Seriously, value every second you have with him. Hes wonderful.", "great stuff. the essay tests are graded a little hard, the end research project is important. Mark is a cool guy with an animated interesting teaching style. (hard to find one like that) Great theatre teacher.", "Time for an honest review, I got a B in 101. Goes way too fast when explaining the lectures. How r you supposed to get ahead when you have no idea where in the book he is teaching from? He covers random sections in the book and uses different methods to teach material. I absolutely do not recommend this teacher!No office hours. Avoid at all costs.", "Very interesting class! Quizzes/ tests were challenging but if you study hard you'll do fine. Only drawback is that there were six required books for American Military and War. Either way, I'd take it again.", "Prof. Gordon is actually quite awesome, it's just so many students now fail to know anything about geography, and one in my class even quoted the subject as \"useless!\". I received As, but because of the stupidity of the students, he had to grade on a curve so they wouldn't all fail. Shame on the youth of America, NOT DR. GORDON.", "He's awsome and entertaining. Dosen't just stick to a certain schedule or course outline. He tries to get you understand and likes to hear his students opinion on the literature.", "A very good professor, but his life is a lie...", "Attendance is very important in his class, there is one midterm and final exam, very easy multiple choice, if you read the book you will get an easy A in that class cause the exam is related to the book. Gives quizzes in class but they are few questions and he lets you use the book so its open quiz. Come to class and easy grade. No papers either.", "I took both Biology 100 and the Lab. You CANNOT use Used Lab Manual & Kit. You have to buy new each semester because he uses different colored lab sheets. Labs are easy. Be Careful if you search Google for answers because some are wrong. Rent textbook instead to save money. Very Easy class overall but it won't help you if you are science major.", "Best ever!!", "Ethusiastic, laidback, hilarious, but sure as hell knows what he's doing. Great man, great class!", "Was able to explain and apply most everything very well. But he also thought he knew everything. Very fair on grading papers and test.", "Hillarious and insightful, a real treat to hear talk, but you need to put in some effort to do well", "Some of the most entertaining lectures I have ever attended. The lectures are largely optional, most of your grades come from your essays and seminar participation, which is graded by your TA. 0% on essay if its late policy. Having a good TA in this course in crucial. If your TA is giving you low grades, switch seminars or drop the course.", "Taught that class like you already knew what he was talking about, and I was silly enough to think that I take classes to learn the material in them. Tried several times to go to his office hours but he was never there. Sent him multiple emails but he never responded. Would strongly recommend never taking this professor.", "Great funny stuff", "great professor...only thing that got me through college algebra was having Todd for elementary and intermediate", "Scripps has a very unique style of teaching. You watch all of the lectures on YouTube before class as homework and then go over the topics in class. This method helps a lot, because you can code right along with him and can pause and rewind. Any questions can be addressed the next day in class as you go over examples. Very good professor.", "This was a good class, pretty easy. He is a very understanding guy and willing to help and likes answering questions from students. Labs were not graded but you needed to attend to understand concepts.

It was a lot of fun and not a lot of BS busy work other teahcers give you.", "i rarely went to class and still got a B... im not even good at econ. the times i did go it was very boring and hard to pay attention. 3 exams and 1 final make up the final grade, and all exams are multiple choice. i would suggest taking the online quizzes, most exam questions are very simalar to the online quizzes.", "Dr. Thielen was extremely intelligent and provided us with all the materials required to pass the class. His lectures were also thought provoking and entertaining.", "DO NOT TAKE HIS DRUGS & SOCIETY CLASS! Idk if the other reviewers were high when they wrote their review but he is a very difficult professor. His final and midterm were outrageously hard. If you miss more than 1 time he was start taking off letter grades. He also tells stories the entire class and it's very hard to stay awake.", "Worst prof I have had in my 5 years in college. He is hateful, mean & rude. It is apparent that he is a man who is unhappy in his life & will take his power of being a professor & use it against his students. He tries to make things as hard as he can. Took him online, only allowed 48-60 seconds per question on tests. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take him!", "Class was a lot of work for not many points at begining of semester, but he gives alot of extra credit opportunities. End of semester there are alot of points left, but actually learn the material so it isnt difficult getting the points.", "If you come to class and take notes you will have no probably passing the class! It is important to study for the test and quizzes because thats the only grades you will recieve. The homework is optional. If you study your notes you will have no problem passing the test or quiz. You have to be willing to put the time in to study to pass.", "I speak for all when I say this professor is just amazing. On my point of view, he is not only a professor but also an advisor who wishes nothing more than the best in your career", "Hard in any eco class I took. Using only book examples and jokes. No real life exposure. Worst economics Prof. Pace has to offer!", "Heb is attrative, but still the wild child of the business dept. He is hilarious.", "I loved Professor Sadkowski. He's a very funny guy with somewhat interesting lectures. You have to read a lot in his class or else you won't pass. His quizzes are based from his mini-books you have to read along with the class one. Read or else you won't pass. It's pretty hard to without them.", "Great teacher. Lecturing is at a minimum; he wants to know he has your attention and you are learning. Many students go to him for encouragement (he cares about his students!). One problem - the topic of the class. Opportunism is dead/dying and businesses will want employees who follow the fundamental rules rather than opportunities to exploit.", "Vinnie is the most amazing teacher. I would definitely take his class again and respect him as a teacher and as a person.", "He is a great guy, extremely helpful, and actually makes class fun.", "nice guy. lectures are a snooze, but if you study you will do well. requires a term paper. just be ready to do some work. i dont hate him but i'm not in love either.", "Nice guy, a little weird, but not in a bad way.

Graded project a little harsh, but I guess we got what we deserved.", "Excellent class and helpful with material presented. Very enthusiastic about women's letter writing.", "avoid this man at all costs!! his tests are essays which he grades according to HIS opinions and what HE thinks is important. no extra credit, and no make-ups. cell phones are the devil to him and DON'T be late!! he will freak out on you!", "this is a joke!!! why is he still teaching!! knows his stuff but does not know how to teach!!! no mercy Run!!!!!!", "No Comments", "He is a very easy professor. I do not think I ever made below an A. He did have some health complications recently. He was always helpful to me.", "Expect a lot of work. Very confusing and hard for no reason. The class was long and boring, and i didn't learn anything. AVOID.", "Dr. Peters does a great job keeping his political affiliation out of his lectures. His class is not easy but he is a really nice guy and helps you succeed. All his exams are online (6 of them) and there is a cumulative in class final (based off previous exam Q's). The online exams are tough but it is not to tough to get B- or B. Tough to get an A.", "changed how i see type. very inspiring. hard teacher. takes attendance. doesn't like it when people don't put his class at top of priorities.", "If you like to experience someone who is rude then this is the professor for you.

Lectures will put you in hibernating state!", "No Comments", "wanted to shoot myself in class....learned nothing...taught myself everything!!!!! you were such a nice man..but a bad prof...need to learn how to interact with college students more", "Hmm... he was alright. Knows a lot about what he's talking about and the topics were interesting, but no good notes provided at all and way too much time spent on \"how to write\" an essay as opposed to the actual course material.

You can not understand him talk... you are better off teaching yourself the material!!!", "Awesome teacher. Definately knows what he is talking about and has some interesting stories to tell.", "He is hilarious, but a tough grader. if you go to office hours he would be gladly to help. Overall just a great person to talk to.", "Fantastic class. You watch so many great films, and he gives great in depth back story to each. 5 quizzes, which are super easy, and 3 papers which are very manageable. Easy, and a very awesome guy, great sense of humor.", "LOVED HIM. He rocks, so nice. He's kind of awkward but the best type of awkward. Saw him downtown Oly so that's cool. He is opinionated but doesn't force his ideas on you. I liked him.", "This is what a good college prof should be like. He's personable, but professional. True you have to study for his tests hardcore, but there's no surprise as to what's on it. I appreciate that. He's hilarious in class and very approachable.", "Okay, he's just an eccentric guy. His grading is kind of random, but he is quite fair. Difficult to find outside of class. Old-school liberal who reveres Truman. He's not intimidating about it though...just proud. No overbearing ideological demagoguery.", "He is so awesome! I would reccomend this class, and professor to everybody! He has tons of knowledge, makes the class fun, and truely cares about his students! I have one more class with him, and I'm actually kinda sad its over!! Believe in the revolution!!", "One of the best professors in JMSB! He teaches student practical skills and finance in the real word, instead of boring textbook theory; He knows that how important the GPA is when you're trying to find a job, so he is never be a hard marker; I learned a lot from students' presentations and while improving my presentation skills.", "No Comments", "This was a networking course, however the projects required writing c++ programs, and the grades were based on how well you program was written and how well it worked. It really didn't matter how well you may know networking.", "No Comments", "Great Professor. Essays and tests are straight forward. Good class for people who do not want to participate because it does not count.", "R Bender is the best financial professor in UTD period. Take him if you want to learn something and pass. Funny guy and encourages questions. I am not a finance guy and the class is challenging but his method of teaching helps a whole lot and helped me. Take him.....if you want to live....through a finance class.", "As a person he was a nice guy, but he did not know how to present his material. He knew his stuff, but he didnt know how to present it to the class. Other than that he is very funny. Good advice!! He has alot of his answers on his homework and exams on his website. So go there and print it off.", "Professor Allen is a very good teacher! I had a 2 hour class with him and he keeps it entertaining. He's an easy grader, he genuinely cares and will teach you how to do certain things before you do an assignment. I would take him again in a heartbeat if I can!", "I loved Midkiff as a person, he was hilarious and told awesome stories a lot, but sometimes his lectures were boring or there were things on the exams that we didn't ever go over. All of the homework is due at the end of the semester, but keep up with it because it helps on the exams. Most of the homework was way harder than the exams though.", "GYM is AWESOM!! He let us play games in class and let us joke about his white head! We played on a console pretty much everyday!", "Horrible class", "Brian is a total joke. His notes were ???? and doesn't teach. before we knew it we had a midterm and no one in the class knew anything???\r \r it's an easy class though. you don't really need him to teach you very much. if you look at your manual and book you will do fine. the FLP is easy", "He gets off on a tangent and wastes tons of class time, but takes attendence so you have to sit through listening to him tell about his brother-in-law buy a suit! I'M NOT JOKING!", "I have to agree the mid-80's vidoes suck and you can go maybe 1 time every two weeks and get an A all open book tests.... i didnt even read one newonce in the book and got a A. anyone need a highlighted book with test ?'s letme know", "boring lectures, not direct, rambles, unorganized, time better used on reading textbook and studying.

Definitely didn't like his material either, was counting down the days til new prof. Definitely knew his material though and was clear.", "I'm a 3.5 gpa student and I dropped this course because of that man behind the podium. He's the most unreasonable, arrogant man I may possibly have ever met. Overall a useless professor that takes advantage of his paycheck. Do NOT take any class he is associated with. I wasted around $1,500 because I didn't read his ratings. Learn from my mistake.", "WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER TAKEN! I tell all my friends NOT to take him. He literally has made me burst into tears because I worked my butt off and got a bad grade- 45% on a twelve page OPINION paper. I cannot stress how much I despise this man!", "Great guy!!!", "Demonstrations in class work 45% of the time. His English is his second language, so sometimes it's hard to understand him. His tests are ALL short answer (*not sure about the Final though.) Many opportunities for grades; participation, homework, home experiments, pretests and exams, however it's a lot of work.", "I had him for Hist 1112 and actually kinda enjoyed his dry humor. It is a lot of writing however and he definitely has high standards as far as the work load goes but you know what's expected of you and he gives you the exam questions ahead of time. Just try to summarize the answers in your textbook in your own words and you'll be fine.", "No Comments", "GEOG 1200 online and it was a fair amount of work. The problem is that his quizzes are not reflected by the material learned. There would be a true/false or MC that had a graded answer different from what the book said, so that was not fair. Also he did not give feedback on why you got the grades you did on discussion posts and essay questions", "If you want santa to give you a lesson take this class. One of the toughest classes I've taken at UCI only because you have to do lots of work outside of class. He talks to us like we know the material because its trivial to him. There is a lot to memorize. Powerpoints and study guide are useless. Just record lecture. Go to class. Study hard.", "Best prof ever had, too bad he left U of C, such an interesting class and totally entertaining stories", "I became addicted to this class: subjects of discussions are very interesting, a few written assignments, most of the grade depends on your performance on the mid-term and final (about 35% each) and two essays. He is very nice toward his students and will take in consideration your effort and dedication to his class so your final grade raises", "This is probably the most useless class I have had in my school career. DO NOT take this class, the major is worthless and you will learn nothing about the entertainment business. The professor isn't qualified to teach pre-school.", "He is a nice Person who is very helpful", "He honestly doesn't care about the student's opinions. He'll tell you that on day one. If you disagree with him, you're wrong. He has this habit of looking around with closed eyes, and then when he asks a question to stare at you incessantly. He grades like an English teacher. He's not. He's been reprimanded by the school before. <3 the subject tho", "One of the sweetest people you ever want to meet.

He truly cares about and respects his students. \"D\" sets a great example for future teachers.", "This professor gave wayyyy too many assignments. We had several repetitious assignments within the first week. I do not like the way he organizes his work on blackboard. He is just a confusing professor overall. I would not recommend taking him........", "Hate science, he made me love it. Very interesting class.", "Very nice guy and really cared about his students. He has some really great stories.", "He's tough at grading but makes it clear that he wants you to write well-written blogs that look professional/interesting and prove that you've read the texts and have thought critically about them. He's British, so his humor is rather dry and sarcastic--I loved it. Very nice as long as you are respectful.", "I took online class PY 101 There is basically no work except 4 on sundays when you have to complete a forum. However, the tests were hard & u have 2 read the chapters at least 3 times to pass, at least that is what he told me when I emailed him about my grade. You have 2 papers that are like 6 pages long. I don't suggest this class.", "Worst prof. I've had in my entire life! Heed the Warning! RUN 4 YOUR LIFE. He is awful. Does not provide u w/feedback & does not want 2 be bothered. He is totally confusing. I have not learned anything in this course. He does not want your input as to what u have learned. He works off a book he and Panzarella wrote together. Need I say more?", "I loved this class. Dr. Sharif has an accent which takes a few days to get used to but he has an amazing teaching style. The majority of lecture is him working out problems by hand. Before each test he does a review of 3 questions which are EXTREMELY similar to the actual test questions. He gives tons of partial credit and always wants to help.", "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD--STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROF!!", "He can be kinda tough, but he really knows his stuff. I'm so glad I had him as a professor. He is definitely one of the best psyc. profs out there.", "No Comments", "I thought this class was easy but I am amazing at Math, but even if you aren't good at math he makes sure that everyone understands what's going on.", "NOT an easy A. Don't get me wrong, this guy is very nice, but he wants you to put ALOT of special effort into his class. That means talking to him, going to his office, going to library etc. When you write papers, your grade drops dramatically for each minute mistake (for instance a misplaced comma) so beware.", "Just a Jerk. He expects you to pick up the material immediately, and is shocked if you don't get it like he does. Says some funny things in class but that's about it. Otherwise he's a hard professor not looking to help you.", "He really is a bad teacher, even if you try your hardest he will still fail you. He is very hard to understand and work with. If you take him GOOD LUCK!!!", "He is really nice and class is fun. However grades are just given on how he feels you did so make sure to try and show up to class. Not sure how hard he expects you to work but an A is very difficult to achieve.", "If you want a good grade, plan on taking his class several times.", "don't let his appearance fool you! he may look like a nice guy, but his exams are very tricky. I knew the book inside out, but ended up only with a B. Highly not recommended!", "Harris is an interesting man with fantastic insights that he's eager to share. The class is interesting but often lacks direction. Harris really wants his students to improve their writing and he's available for extra help. However, he's really unclear about what he wants on assignments, which creates a lot of confusion. He also cusses in class.", "Best English prof I ever had... I am a much better writer and thinker for having had him. You will work for your grade, but it's worth it. Highly recommended.", "Bell is smart and he can be witty, but he's a very bad teacher. His lectures are entertaining because he's such a nut-ball. He'll start yelling for no reasons about a stupid detail from a film. Unclear and vague. Avoid.", "terrible.", "Professor Thielen was awesome! He allows you to use your study guides on the tests, making them 100x easier. If you don't like purchasing textbooks find someone who can share theirs with you, you WILL need it! You might get some last minute cancellations and he allows you 3 unexcused absences but he makes class interesting enough. I recommend him!", "This prof seems disengaged and bored when he lectures. He can also be quite blunt and intimidating. 2 short tests + 1 paper (40%) and attendance/participation. I would not recommend this course to anyone unless they are knowledgeable on religions.", "Love this class. All you have to do is show up and listen. the exams are super easy if you come to class. Hes a really funny guy with a unique sense of humor. One of a kind at URI", "He is so snubby. i hate his personality", "I was amazed that someone could have such a large ego. He acts like he's too good for an intro to stats course, but I think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students. It's a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays $130 that goes right to his pocket", "Very tough grading. Can be easier in giving grades and assignments.", "Outstanding prof. I hate to repeat what everyone else is saying but I have to say he really does have a great teaching style and he sincerely cares about his students.", "If you are looking to get a quick A without any work this is definetely not the class for you. This Teacher is really requiring students to increase their critical thinking skills. If you follow directions you'll do well. He does answer e-mails and he has provided a slew of information to assist you in doing your best. Excellent Teacher!!", "Quirky character, but once you get past his eccentricities he's a great professor and really does care about his students. He even took our whole class out to lunch one day. He just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tolerate people with a half-hearted interest in the subject very well. Firm grader. Excellent lecturer. Good material to know in world affairs these days.", "He isn't very clear as a teacher and his tests are hard but he is very helpful. He is very generous grading as well. He won't fail anybody that tries.", "If you're a psyc major at UTT, you will have to take Dr. Schrieber for several classes. He is a very knowledgable professor, but has no pedagogic ability whatsoever. Granted you will make an A guaranteed, but you won't learn anything at all. Dr. Schriber may be a cool guy, but his classes are a total waste of time and money.", "Great professor, though very demanding as well! I learned a lot in his class", "HEHEHE", "Do Not take this class. He has no idea how to teach, would talk about random things and is never helpful with the papers. So hard to approach doesn't really care what your asking for. unless you are a professional at writing don't take his class. Has stupid tests every class which are no help.", "Close your eyes and you'd swear Winnie the Pooh was teaching. A very caring and pleasant professor who makes sure you get through with a good grade.", "You have about 10 homeworks per semester. The tests are based on the concepts covered in the homeworks. Don't be afraid to go to his office hours, he will try to help you without giving you the answer directly. His class is challenging but you will learn something.", "He made motor development very fun and interesting. Here's a secret the final exam is the study guide he gives you or at least it was for us.

Overall an excellent teacher!", "Incredibly Smart, wayyyyyyyy left wing.. soo disillusioned with the U.S", "Let me start by saying no science course is easy. Especially biology. Mr. Wernli gives weekly quizez and keeps only your 10 best grades. there are 3 lecture test and 3 lab test.

The class is very easy for the most part because you are studying how people defy norms in society. Gendron's lectures are AWESOME. Best I've had. He gives examples with the notes WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL for your in class essays. Overall, amazing professor, and great class.", "The tests are really hard, but it doesn't matter because he gives so many opportunities for extra credit. His class is extremely boring. DON'T TAKE AS ITV CLASS! He rambles about stuff that is never on the test. He talks like Zoolander.", "Easy if keep up, useful for life, helpful if ask for it", "So I took him for several classes and I always dropped him. He goes too slow and repeats the same stories in every single class. He made sleepy. He also skips around on the subjects too so I could not organize the info in my head... you have to be there, his tests come straight from the notes. Write down EVERYTHING he says.", "He obviously knows his stuff, but his teaching methods don't really help. It's either only theory without showing how to apply to any problem, or he gives an example problem with a solution method that only works on that problem. I found that going to tutoring was a better way to learn the material. I would recommend him over some other teachers", "Best professor in MDC. I acquired an interest in science after taking this class... He gives vocab quizzes that you have get from the book and gives handouts to study for the test. If you study you will get an A. I did...", "Great professor! Does everything possible to allow you to get an A! Really enthusiastic and loves teaching!", "Cool class - Very Interesting. Take notes on all of the * items in lecture and study the syllabus handout and you WILL make an A. He is a great professor - you will really like this class. Did I mention - NO BOOK!!!!!

Kind of nerdy but in the best way - take him you wont regret it!!!", "Good teacher, easy to follor. lots of demonstartions in class to keep your attention.", "Some of the material he teaches is outdated. This was a race and ethnicity class so I was hoping to learn a lot about various ethnic groups. However, we spent a lot of time learning of his study on French and English relations instead. Mid-Term was easy but the course overall was unevenly distributed with too much weight on one paper.", "cool deal mama", "Exercise Physio was an incredibly fascinating and relatable class. That being said, Fisher is a very specific grader on free response questions and his multiple choice items aren't very easy. You can only miss 2 questions on the entire test to get the lowest A, something that is almost guaranteed to happen. The material gets tough..its a hard class", "Awesome Prof! Speaks quickly in lecture but if you pay attention, the lectures are very informative. a lot of essays, but they are intended to improve your writing for your future university career.I would love to take another class taught by him.", "Boomin' voice and great enunciation. Lectures at a good rate- not too fast & not too slow. Willing to always repeat himself to make sure you get the notes down. Very caring and approachable. Gives study guides and preps you well for the exams. Lectures are precise, but it's better to read the book too when studying for tests. BEST TEACHER EVER!", "Very strict at first but lightens up as the semester goes on. He's a tough but fair grader but gives good feedback to help you improve. He explains the readings and what he expects on the essays if you bother showing up to class. His lectures are dry but have great content.", "If you get lost during the class you can resort to writing BG quotes in your margins..such as: \"I'm good at geography!\" or \"Not everyone goes around saying 'I'm an Incritite!\" or \"I am not sure of the Catholic doctrine of what happend when the food and wine is digested.\" He has a puzzling dislike for pentacostals though...", "This professor does not practice what he preaches. Grading system and requirements were constantly changing. Very poorly prepared for class and time spent in class not properly administrated. Spent too much time bragging about himself vs. teaching the class topic", "I've taken three of Bob's classes. He is very easy to understand and make the subject matter interesting. He is always willing to answer questions. He is very clear on what will students will be tested on and provides handouts for note-taking/study guide purposes.", "I see some of the older ratings say he's too quick and there's too many notes. I took Operations Mngmt with him and I dont remember writing down more than 5 lines in any given class. He has office hours two times a weeks which is great and he knows the field inside out which is great if you're interested in it further.. Only good things to say..", "DO NOT take this class if you don't want to waste your time. Spending 15 minutes out of a 50 minute class writing on the whiteboard, saying NOTHING while writing, is a waste of everyones time.

I learn a lot about society and social issues.", "Beneski clearly knows his stuff but does not know how to teach it to others. Lectures are boring and monotone, making it very difficult to focus.

Jim is a great teacher. He knows what he's talking about. Game demos in/during class completely relevant to lecture, and they are all great games. Jim is obsessed with Shmups, but it makes a good inside joke. I had a great time in this class, and I am trying to be a TA next year.", "Some people are not used to the terminology, so that can get confusing if you don't already have prior knowledge about anatomy. The two most important things are: attending lecture and taking really good notes. His tests are all based off of what he says, so re-read your notes to understand thoroughly.", "Honestly, one of the laziest professors I have ever encountered. Took him for an online course and not only was he awful in replying back, his folders are so clustered that material from 2012 is still uploaded. A final project (worth 100 points) due on the last day of the course was uploaded by him the day before. Would NEVER take him again!!!", "Brought good resources into the class from being a photojournalist, but judging by his effort this is clearly his side job. Means well but I was definitely expecting more guidance.", "Very nice, lectures well.", "One of my favorite teachers, because he absolutely LOVES what he's teaching! I tend to fall asleep during other teacher's lectures, but not Dr. Haynie's. Well...at least not not NEAR as much!", "A good professor, super easy and nice, I would recommend him for child psych, attendance is not mandatory but if you miss he does not put the slides on blackboard so it is recommended you go, plus you'll find yourself wanted to go to class", "I clickers, homework every night, test every two weeks, assigned readings that have nothing to do with physics besides justifying his teaching schedule.

Don't take Vlad.", "Very challenging (in a good sense) and very thought provoking!!!!", "So, I just want to say that Burns is an awesome teacher...no doubt about it. His love of math makes the class interesting. You know he enjoys what he does from the way he acts. He is always smiling and is very easy going. He has solved difficult problems in front of the class. Very impressive! Side note...he is an avid player of chess! Pretty cool.", "KEEP AWAY!!!!! This man is boring , miserable and sucks at grading. He weill lose your work and won't hand it back until it is too late to drop the course. I almost left John Jay because of him. If I had to I would skip a semester just so I wouldn't have to take him again. Poor excuse for a professor or therapist.", "I took this class on summer 2015. Professor is so nice, he always helpfulness. But he cant give good grade, and I dont think is easy about his test. I just got grade B on this class, that so sad. You need buy his book cause have code with that book , his all test online.", "Homework isn't mandatory, which is nice. Does a lot of examples on the board, but makes a lot of mistakes. Is NOT a fair grader, taking off more points than necessary for small mistakes (especially considering how often he messes up on the board). Overall, he is a nice guy, though, and i would definitely take a class with him again.", "It was a very easy class. All we did was write a couple papers and talk about the book, yet I still left feeling like I had learned something. It was not what I expected for accelerated composition. Highly recommended.", "i once even saw his assistant/ta fall asleep and then wake up at the end drooling, he puts everyone asleep", "good teacher very helpful and easy to get along with", "Tests are kinda hard but he cancelled the final and gave everyone a 100, the lowest test grade out of four including the final was dropped so it essentially counted for a third of the grade", "To save yourself do not take this class. Max is like a robot and his lectures are boring. He gives pop quizzes, which stinks, and he only grades your grammar and punctuation. He also does not give good feedback, and is unorganized.

Love phil, and would've majored but for this ludicrous clown. And definitely NOT hot.", "Good for an elective. Didn't get a lot from his classes, and his lack of clarity/guidance left me in the dark at times. VERY odd at times, just say what he wants you to hear. I think he's too old to care too much anymore what others think..?", "His parasitology class is a lot of work but he makes it extremely interesting. Offers EC. Really nice guy and very passionate!", "Dave is the amazing, I love this man! I had him in my second semester of Fanshawe, and he really cares about his students. He encouraged me to go to university and I did and love it. He is a great man, gives you lots of chances to get marks! Criminal Justice with him was one of the best classes I have ever taken!", "Took an online class. Pretty easy sinceCollege Algebra is mostly same as high school algebra. Used videos on ConnectMath as review and made easy A's. There's a lot of homework, but discussions are easy. It was just roll call or saying something like \"I understand ______.\"", "Best math teacher I've ever had. I took calc 2 in high school so this was a refresher course in a way (i did horrible in high school so i needed to relearn it) but he went over an enormous amount of examples and was easily accessible & so open for questions. I wish he taught at the university!", "Talhammmmm, my man!!! What a gem of a professor! I had him for inorganic chemistry and it was one of my favorite classes! Sure, inorganic chemistry can be hard, but this man made it worth reading the textbook, looking over his notes, and studying for the exams. He truly made this class enjoyable. His exams are VERY fair, so worth it!!", "He can come off a bit arrogant but he is always willing to go the extra mile and help you. As long as you're respectful he'll work with you.", "No Comments", "nice guy, really loves physics, he tries hard but is not too good at explaining physics good enough for people to really understand it", "He's a great guy and a great prof! Just go to class and you'll ass. 1 in class, 1 homework assignment every week. Time consuming but easy. Helps you learn a lot about excel in a way that will actually help you in the real world. I can't stress enough to take him.", "No Comments", "Dr. Tompkins teaches for understanding, not memorization. Come to class, participate and pay attention. Hi lecture videos are exactly what he taught in class so if you don't understand something, watch it until you get it. His quizzes are short, but difficult. I cannot stress enough how important coming to class and paying attention are.", "he's a great teacher and he's willing to help if you ast... word to the wise.. dont get behind", "He is very boring, soft spoken and likes to ramble. He talks so slowly yet quickly that it's hard to decipher the gibberish that he speaks. His slides are not great either. Keep your studies to the textbook.", "Easy class but the guy is a complete ass.", "Bob is a great professor, he is old school and uses an overhead so you pretty much have to go to class because he does not utilize e-learning except to post the syllabus. If you go to class and pay attention, he gives you every opportunity to make an A. He thoroughly explains everything and does several practice problems in class. Take him!", "Very all over the place. He likes to tell stories and unfunny jokes....but he's a nice man and seems to care about the student. He gives you study guides before the tests but some of the things on the test aren't on the guide. Take LOTS of notes and read the text.", "this guy took me a while to figure out, but after a few weeks i was completely sold. his classes and wisdom actually helped me in my personal life and a lot of the reading he assigned is some of my favorite literature now. he is the kind of professor that makes me feel better about paying a gajillion dollars a term in tuition.", "The presentation is a BIG part of your grade, but you work on it for most of the semester. It really isn't THAT big of a deal since it's not all due at once.", "This guy is a great teacher with extreme passion. He cares very much about you learning something. His explaining ability is a top notch, complex and incricate concepts come to be easily grasped after his explanations. Definetly recommended!", "He's very patient and willing to help his students so much. His quizzes and and tests are not too hard. Tests are based on the quizzes. Highly recommended.", "No Comments", "DO NOT TAKE HIM. 2 weeks to read the syllabus to us word for word. 2 days to split up the class into equal groups that you never talk to. Tests are online but impossible to pay attention in class so not easy. Very rude. Spends the first half hour of a 50 minute class going over everything we did the day before. It's miserable save yourself.", "He is a great lecturer. He loves teaching and it shows.", "A class on the body could be mind numbing or awesome. The downside was that a lot of things weren't discussed at all; dance, sports, sex. The upside was the professor, who seemed excited and open about the topic, and I had to think about stuff I'd never thought about. Body modification, gender assignment?!?", "Dr. Burton requires his students to write weekly. A lot work if you miss class it will hurt grade even if you complete all the work. I wouldn't take him again", "He is a great teacher. Makes learning fun and is willing to stay late to help you get it. One of my favorite teachers so far.", "Textbook narcissist that simply should not be a teacher. Hot-tempered, drops f-bombs, and attacks and belittles students who ask questions. You will have to find a way to let his racial comments, cursing and talking to people like they're mentally handicapped not bother you, just so you can pay attention in lecture. He's very childish, really.", "Why were most of the recent bad reviews deleted? Bruce is probs reporting all these lol", "Tough but fair and willing to help but you gotta ask.", "Professor Matheson is a very smart and nice guy. He is more than willing to explain any question you have until you understand the concept. He gives difficult homework and test but grades it very graciously. If you do the work you will get an A in his class.", "Very nice professor and a super easy class! You can take this class for two weeks in the summer. We did an instant activity, notebook, and peer teaching, and class was fun. Everyone got an A!", "Best English professor ever, Very thoughtful. An easy A. Take this class if you want become a better writer.", "If you don't like this guy, you're taking yourself and your studies TOO SERIOUSLY. He's completely avoids BS rules, such as attendance, solid deadlines, mandatory class participation, etc. However, he is a hard paper grader; you can't just write a BS paper and get an A. If you slack off you'll get a B, if you can write well, you'll get an A.", "Super easy. show up to class. take some notes. stay for the films. only 2 tests (midterm and final) both are open note and open book. and one extremely easy paper. no reason for anyone to get lower than a B. He's a no BS kind of guy. He knows what he is talking about.", "Able to explain things well by relating them to the classmates. can tell he really knows and loves the information he teaches. wants you to understand everything so that you could also teach a class about it.", "Enjoyed the class subjects but found some of the lectures tedious. He obviously knows his stuff and discussion groups aren't too bad.", "Prof. H. Afshari was extrermenly helpful. Vey interesting man to listen to,he has seen and been through alot. definetly learn alot in his class.", "He is Gneiss as schist. We love you Mr. Coleman!! You know who this is from!", "Doesnt understand students nowadays, he expects too much. He gave us our first exam the end of October and expected us to do well on 7 chapters of studying.", "Super sweet, laid-back professor. Is willing to meet with you outside of class if you missed the material one day and explain anything you don't understand. Also answers emails relatively quickly. He really cares about the students and wants you to succeed in post-grad life.", "Great professor. Interesting class.", "I love Dr. Snay, and his class is great! My only complaint is that his assessments are incredibly picky. Most of the stuff you need to know will be one-liners from the book that you would probably not give a second glance to, so be super careful. He loves history and teaching but I think he forgets that not all of us can be walking encyclopedias.", "This is the second class I've taken with Craig and I have learned so much. He is a tough grader, but the very nature of sculpture is difficult. If your hard work is apparent, he will notice, but you have to really try to get an A in his class. Attendance is mandatory, like all studio classes, and final documentation is also a big part of your grade", "AVOID this \"professor\". Did not grade according to his own stated criteria. Very late in returning work. Very limited participation in required online discussions.", "As an \"A\" student, this class ranks as the most difficult class I have ever taken due to this professor.He wants to fail you.Tests are multiple choice but very tricky.Students were lucky because he injured his foot so Dr. Sanchez took over. Sanchez was the exact opposite of Vandergrift.Class is still hard but Sanchez wants you to pass.Take Sanchez!", "Great guy", "Rants about the state of and dislike for the school frequently, which is a bummer. Often vague or one-sided in class lecture; I learned most because I had to learn independently in order to defend my positions against his in class. Learned a lot, got an A nonetheless.", "He is a great teacher. He is very nice and helpful. I highly recommend this teacher. He is a real Chef with real experience.", "Harris actually made me like EN115. Great teacher. I'd recommend to anyone.", "psy majors beware, this teacher thinks psychology is a waste of time. he's narrow minded, but you shouldn't be afraid to get into debates w/him. i still enjoyed the class because it's an interesting topic, and he is a likeable guy, and he kind of grows on you. it was a fairly easy A.", "This guy is extremely genius but I came to realize this at the end of the semester. So, just have a positive attitude from the out set and take him with no hesitation. Trust me; you are going to love Logic for the rest of your life.", "Took class Fall 1996. Funny guy. Once asked the students why they took a 9AM lecture. (um, we were freshmen, we had little choice.) Exams and assignments were difficult but fair.", "The most helpful, considerate, and informative professor here at Philau. I had him for 2 years and wish I was still in his class. You'll learn more from Grout and will enjoy his classes, even the 8 am class.", "WORST PROFESSOR AT WCU! I have never had such a rude & uncaring professor. His lectures do little to prepare you for the exam and his power points are confusing and have slim to none useful info on them. I am pretty sure he is glad that his class is close to impossible. Not sure why he's a professor because it seems like he hates students & his job", "DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN!!! He is so ... hard. If you want to do well your better taking someone else. His tests are extremely hard and analitical. I studied like crazy and managed to pull a C out of the class.", "Very helpful! He really understands students and is willing to work with you. One of the best professors I've ever had! Really funny as well!", "Pretty funny which makes even 3 hour lectures feel short. Although, he is probably more skilled on how to make his students feel stupid rather than the actual subject of Philosophy. I started out the class with about 30 classmates and half way through only 8 of us were left. You have to work extremely hard to even receive a B. Would NOT recommend.", "Prof Burk is literally the best professor. I hate math and he made the class bearable. Moreover, he is always willing to help and always responds to email. 100% recommend him for Business Calc!!", "No Comments", "He is the best, for students who want to study. If you are lazy please take someone else. I took him online this semester spt2013 all I had to do is do what he asked and I received an A. Thank you or an interesting semester professor Vona.", "Likes to tell people they are \"Misguided\" because they disagree with his view.", "No Comments", "Hes opinionated and a bit biased, but hes got a good sense of humor and is fun to talk to, if he can hear you. He wont bust any chops for stupidity, so avoid him during the summer semester. Good man though and will listen. Its a relaxing class (nice if you're taking 12 units).", "Lecker is awesome. Engage with him. Get to know him. Don't get so defensive about the supposed \"ego\" that everyone on here is talking about, and just let him open your eyes a little - you might like what you see, you might not, but either way, taking his class is essential for learning how to talk about art.", "He is never wrong. Try to ask him something on a test why it is wrong, he wont admit he made a mistake in grading.Even took it to another teacher and said that it was right. So if you make a mistake always your fault because you didnt learn the material supposedly", "Dr. Hill is one of the best and most passionate MIS teachers. all the people who don't like him should honestly consider changing their major. He expects that you read the book which is short and good. his tests are very tricky cuz u have to link concepts but he does hook it up with a nice curve. he cares a LOT about students and teaching.", "Dr. Frank is amazing. I appreciated the stories he told about using what we were learning in his medical practice. His tests are difficult, but his reviews are incredible. You'll learn a lot with Dr. Frank!", "very confusing. i regret enrolling in this class. his soc 128 class is way more tolerable than soc 129.", "Craig Stettner is awesome! I did not want to take a science class at all, but he definitely made it worth my while. He offers so much extra credit (over 100 points)! I got D's on tests, but still ended with an A in the class. Every lecture he gives you exercises which are nice grade boosters. Expect to go outside. Craig is really nice and helpful!", "He's a pretty good lecturer. His lectures are organized and straight forward. His quizzes are pretty much like the homework problem he assigns. The exams are mostly multiple choice (w/one written prob.) and he gives you a formula sheet to use. I find it to be easy if you study the hw problems. He posts solutions online before the exam. GREAT PROF!!", "boring and doesnt really put effort into his teaching... very unprofessional, falls asleep himself a lot. he's easy, but if you actually are interested and want to learn then you will be dissapointed.", "This is by far one of my worst math teachers in my entire life. Does not explain many things on the tests. Loncapa is much more difficult than it should be since it does not give you the right answer when trying to teach the math to yourself. I highly recommend not taking this class with him. Any other teacher is probably a better option.", "Some of the readings were interesting, such a sweet guy but forgetful and confused about who you are in relation to his class... so nice though definately worth the class.", "No Comments", "Prof. Walker is a good teacher. I feel like it's really hard to understand what he is actually trying to say most of the time though. However, if you read the book and actually study and try to understand vs. memorize the material you will be fine. If you put effort into the class you'll get an A/B bc the tests aren't extremely hard conceptually", "We'll miss you Owen. You were a very caring teacher and a great guy.", "David is awesome and funny! He might be retiring soon so he is slacking off on harsh grading/number of assignments. He uses many ways of teaching. Videos, lectures, acting something out, etc. Its a history class so expect it to be kinda boring.", "Great teacher. Very technical course for the first half, but we got to do some really cool things after we got the basics under our belt. He put a lot of information into the class but it's stuff I have not gotten from my other teachers. We did HTML, CSS, XML, Dreamweaver, Flash, action scripting, PHP, video and sound. LOTS of New Media Art too!!", "Intelligent and able to relay the materials. Not to mention he is one hell of a nice guy as well.", "great professor. helps you t understand the subject matter. Highly recommended", "There is no help here when needed, he's cocky and you are never right....", "He treats his students with respect and likes to push them to think about their beliefs from all angles.", "Very thoughtful guy. He is not very approachable but he loves each an every one of his students. Some people connect with him better than others. I always believed that we were very similar so I think this kept us from getting to know each other better. An honest hard working man", "He continuously asks you to redo projects and then drops your grade for handing them in \"late\". He spent most of the classes trying to figure out his own code rather then teaching us how to code things.", "knows his material...easy class if you pay attention and read the assignments. ALOT of work at the end of the semester...had about 20 papers all at the last week because waited till the last minute....got a B..fun discussions", "Perhaps it's just the 231 class that is hard, because I don't know what everyone else is whining about. Duane is an absolute GENIUS when it comes to problem-solving and abstract thinking, and he looks at the subject matter in such an interesting, fresh way. He is a fair grader and it's not hard to do well if you study your book. And he's hilarious.", "Mr. Quereshi is awesome!!! He was easy. I never understood what he was saying, but I'm also from an area in which people only speak English. He really tries to make you understand. He is pretty funny and has a great personality!! He never responds to emails, though. IF YOU CAN, TAKE HIM!!!!!", "No Comments", "Really difficult class, but you will learn a lot. Memorizing all the equations is challenging, but hopefully one day it pay off. You work hard on the homework and minitest and he rewards you with a reasonably easy final (if you study hard)", "I have taken 2 classes with him. Awsome teacher! Makes class fun, and different than others! Gives you plenty of time to work on papers. Papers are not long, but detailed. Follow directions to a T.", "Nice guy. Starts quotes with \"Gee...\" which gets irritating. Knows his material. Trys not to play favorites, but the suck ups seems to get through (you know who you are). I would recommend him based on his warm personality and ability to convey detailed analyses with little trouble.", "He is a great prof. Very helpful and Dylan also keeps him going. Lectures are boring, tests are ridiculous but not hard. His classes are all the same. Also, he reminds me of the sloth off of Ice Age.", "Took this class a few years ago...but still remembered the effort he put into teaching us. Was very organized, had excellent notes & gave us stories and tips to remember important information. Made a hard class fun.", "He is AWESOME!! At first I wasn't sure but it got better. When he assigns a reading, read it! He will quiz you! Lectures are long, he sometimes goes over time but only by a few minutes. He is funny, cracks silly jokes. Study for his exams, they are not easy. They are 2 questions and written. You must work for grade. Would absolutely take him again!", "Great teacher and he's the best looking one at MICA.", "Tests are way too hard for a first year mandatory class. Almost 40% failing by second quiz. So unnecessary to make this course so hard. Ya he cares but doesnt make it easy so whats the point", "Coleman is fascinating to listen to, but unfortunately he is EXTREMELY unclear about assignments. He is not useful when you ask for clarification on assignments, and just expects you to know what he means on his obtuse questions. Very intelligent man, but needs to learn how to support students as much as he challenges them.", "One of the best professors at Atkinson. This guy really cares about his students, is always nice and polite, is helpful and fair with marks if you can make a good case. I'm not sure who wrote the part about his English, but they got it all wrong, his English is very good. He is one of the few good prof's in Atkinson Business courses.", "Mr. Jones is a gifted instructor. He is knowledgable, friendly, approachable, and easy to undestand. The very first day he is kind of scary and seems closed-minded, but I think it's just a show to make his point. He is always helpful. I wish he taught other music classes as well. We are very lucky to be able to take classes from such a great teacher for so little money.", "Reg was an awesome teacher. So fun and funny and he really brought the material to life. He teaches in a way that you feel like you're making the connections and really learning. His class was rich and seminar orientated so students could speak plenty and ask questions (not just lecture). Great course, fun and I learned a lot.", "Again it's ashame to see so many disgruntled students. In fact this is a good professor, misunderstood at times yes. If you take the class properly and open your mind up you'll learn a lot. He's rusty on the details of program usage, but that's what your textbook is for. Go to him with macro-environment (computer) questions and he'll teach a lot.", "Overall good professor, but the class is alot of work and it's difficult to know him other than at the huge lectures", "simply the worst professor I've ever had, doesn't care for students, gives little to no sympathy what so ever, hard to talk to, and just not a nice guy. I recommend not taking this class, he is a tough grader, does meaningless quizzes", "Best teacher ever", "I had Dr. A for conducting, and he was very clear and a great prof, but definitely challenging.", "Terrible loss for the English Department at SSU. My heart goes out to his family~", "No Comments", "If you come to class, take notes on the '*' items, and spend maybe 15 minutes looking over your notes and study guide before the test you WILL make a A.

Love the guys attitude", "started out invested, but then started acting like he really didn't care. he's dried up all ready!", "A paragraph was due weekly, grades were unclear until the end. He looks for very small details in all of the stories read. Close reading is necessary", "great guy!", "Awesome class... excellent professor. I learned more and enjoyed this class more than ANY other in the criminal justice department. IF you have any interest in criminal law whatsoever... you'll love it.", "He is rude. When you talk to him, he turns your back towards you and starts talking to somebody else. On the final exam, he changed the order of the questions but forgot to change the order of the answers. In addition, the scanner missed some answers. We were shocked when we received the results but he would not believe us that something went wrong", "This guy is pretty good. I wasn't a huge fan of the material, but who does like quant?", "Dr. Caporale gives interesting lectures, but as far as material and tests are concerned, the book is a very helpful resource. Studying is essential for the multiple choice exams which can be difficult.", "very helpful. course lectures very well structured. best prof i have come across.", "Great guy, really into what he teaches. He actually used ecollege (unlike other professors). Highly recommend him for any class he teaches.", "Great teacher. Awesome class.", "worst prof ever. no one got higher than a B in the class. He told us that the semester would get better as it progressed as long as you applied what you've learned... for the term essay (worth 35%) the class average was a D+. He's the kind of prof that never made it further in his field and is taking his frustration out on his students.", "very nice, easy going....nice class... is he married?", "Funny at times, tries to make the fun interesting. He make become repetitive, but he does have good lectures sometimes. Has 3 tests 100 questions and a final. Gives you the pre test for each one of those tests. He might change about 10 or 15 answers from pre test. Ready the book!!!Good Guy.", "I wasn't impressed with this professor at all. He is a very nice person, but as a prof, I was unhappy with the unreasonable workload and how he plays favorites. This is the most useless class in the COE, but everyone must take it. He's not horrible but definitely get in on his good side and you'll do well.", "I was very hesitant to take this class but honestly Prof Karras is the best. He really knows his stuff and is willing to help anyone who asks for it. There is a midterm and a practical final, but every technique is clearly reviewed and gone over multiple times throughout the semester. Take karate with this prof, you'll have fun and won't regret it.", "Note: I only had Mr. Lombrana for the lab part, not the instruction part. He is a cool guy, laid back, and is very clear on all his instructions. No tricks with this guy, he tells you exactly what he wants.", "Horrible professor, took his class online. He never replies in 5 weeks i sent 4 emails he replied to 1 with a rhetorical question of one line i don't understand the material and he does not care.", "Very good teacher..hard test though", "good man.", "No Comments", "Grading was terrible, enough said.", "OMG!

Although the material sounds fun and interesting, too much busy work is expected from the course and its a struggle to get a decent grade. His lack of clarity when it comes to assignments creates numerous difficulties throughout the year. Consider this a warning.", "Prof. Kneski is what study abroad should be all about. He has little patience for children, but all the time in the world for those that are serious. Best teacher I ever had at FIU.", "His class is boring. but how can anyone make English Law interesting?

Overall - good guy", "He is so hilarious. He will have you laughing every class. Tests are hard though. You only get a mid-term and a final, which are half multiple choice and half fill in the blank. Also you have to do a project. You should pass if you take good notes and do the project.", "To everyone considering taking him, heres a warning.Hes totally changed his style. No more quizzes or matching on the tests. The tests are all fillin and he gives no specificity on who to concentrate on so u have to know who over 300 people are for a test on top of at least 3 essays, which he grades hard. Cool dude, but be cautious.", "No Comments", "I loved his class. I learned lots of new material. Just study hard and practice and you'll do fine.", "The blah blah style course... should you want to learn something, stay away...", "Very good to give individual help when needed.

What is unknown is that on the 8th day God looked down on his kingdom and was displeased, so he created Don Hood.", "Don't take this class whatever you do. Professor reed is very intelligent, but he rambles about the most random things. He brings up glocks and tommy lee jones at LEAST once every lecture. You only have three or four grades, which are all in class essays. The TA & SI sessions are where you learn and get to the point. Take Econ instead.", "absolutely awful. how does this man still have a job here?", "A nice man that knows what it is that he is teaching. I don't understand the class at all, but it is enjoyable at times. The textbook doesn't explain things well, although we use it a lot. An expensive class. Maybe not a first choice class.", "He is a nice person and I have found him to be more helpful in one-on-one situations. The lectures are not particularly helpful, since you are expected to do the bulk of your learning in studio.", "Get ready to read ALOT! We basically read articles that were pointless throughout the semester and got quizzed on them.

Class is fun and grades very fairly.", "No Comments", "He is extremely anal about how you do things. He is also extremely cocky.", "cool teacher, easy class, and hardly any work. i had him once a week for a night class. we never stayed the 2&1/2 hours, usually held us for 1&1/2 hrs. went through the readings with us in class so we knew what the material was. only knock on him is hes a tough grader. 1 midterm & final paper", "the best prof EVER", "Excellent professor and human being. His level of knowledge is amazing and can deliver it through his teaching. Warning: He expects a lot and is not as easy grader!", "Paciocco presented the material in clean fashion. Sometimes he jumped around, especially during the winter term, but his lectures are inspiring and amazingly knowledgeable. If you want to learn criminal law the right way, Paciocco is your man. Just be prepared for rigorous fact pattern exams.", "Great if you like taking a class taught by a moron. Also great if you take the bible at its literal meaning, like he does.", "Okay i regret not knowing that his tests are directly from his slides. Don't even read the book. I did that for the 1st two tests and failed miserably. Term project did great on. Aced the final. Explained why i did bad on 1st 2 tests and he wudn't bump me up.

He thinks he covers topics, but doesn't. Please, you love your GPA, do not try it!!!!", "He definitely didn't have a clue about how to teach a SAGES seminar, even though you could tell he tried hard. He graded papers very oddly and seemed to be evaluating them as if they were scientific journal articles, which they certainly were not. He was a nice guy but many people in the class felt they came away shortchanged.", "I personally think he is a great professor. I am kind of crazy and love physics though. I would say if you like physics, go for it, plus he has a very lenient grading scale (for 100 level classes anyway).", "I really enjoyed this class. It was VERY difficult, but Eierman makes it very interesting and as easy as he can. His demos are usually pretty cool, and he makes it very clear what you will be tested on. Overall, he's a very helpful prof!", "No Comments", "Lets you use \"fact sheets\" for every quiz or exam including finals! helps a lot!", "This professor has an innate understanding of the American government and taught it in a way that students could relate to.

NOT with this guy. Very disorganized. Very stuborn. His test dont test knowledge. cool guy, but sucks as a teacher. he came 30 minutes late to our exam. had another exam a week before our project was due, and wouldnt push it back becuase he wanted to demo the projects(create video game) for the last few classes.", "not a bad professor, takes attendance for every class, presentation, exams are easy (mc & short essays).", "My 3 tips for anyone taking a class with Blitz: 1) do NOT come to class unprepared. 2) participate. 3) enjoy yourself. He is awesome. A little scary sometimes but he really wants his students to do well.", "Ruben likes to talk. A lot. But thats ok as long as you're interested in the History Of Design And Architecture. Overall I'd say he's cool.", "Jay Ko cuts through pompous textbook explanations and teaches the essential knowledge. He will not pamper you though, and I think that made a lot of people drop the section. I will take him again for calc.", "he likes to talk about his cat and diareha.", "Prof. Bloom is a brilliant but arrogant man that will not hesitate to make fun of anyone in order to make himself look better. Be careful as you can learn a lot from his classes, but can get a lot of grief from them as a result of his perfectionism and high handed manner as well.", "Well. They dont call him chainsaw chambers for nothing. Not very clear on what he wants you to study. He emphasizes NOT using the book, and ONLY listening to him, but, his notes can be kind of confusing. Got a 10 on the first test! a 30 on the 2nd test, and a 70-something on final. Walked away with a C! Class averages were similar to those grades.", "He is a great teacher! I enjoyed going to class and listening to what he had to say. He is an easy teacher if you do the work.", "I tried liking him. I really did. I really wanted to. This class was awful. It was the same content as Mahmoodi's section, but he managed to drive it into the ground and not teach anything whatsoever. For the love of all that is well in the world do not take this man for dynamic systems. Mahmoodi will not actively try to ruin your life.", "There was an awful lot of him writing on the board...copying problems...that took up alot of time. I thought he was a bit arrogant. The only reason I got a C was because I went to a tutoring class with an AWESOME russian woman whose name I forget. I would NOT take this professor again.", "hot accent", "Awesome prof - if you want to learn how to write, this is the man. Interesting, helpful, and actually teaches so you learn. My favorite at BCC.", "I had Kwag years ago and still remember his classes. You HAVE to go to every class and do the work. He is an outstanding professor and notices who shows up and who does not. He's extremely smart and you will learn a lot from him. He's more than willing to help, but if you don't keep up with the work it will run you over.", "Am actually shocked at how high of a rating he has, homework is due every week and is only worth 10% of the grade while the tests are worst 70% and are way harder than homework. He's also very confusing to follow and he goes so fast, not the best if you arent strong in math for sure.", "He is nice and makes the cleass interesting", "Awful. Worst experience in college career", "Very interesting class, super fair tests, very pleasant professor. Not an easy \"A\" but attainable. Go to class and start your journals early and you shouldn't have any trouble passing. Unger seems like a genuinly nice guy.", "Good class! I'm a lazy person and that final exam really worked me out wew!", "Knows history and truly enjoys when students are engaged. This can be a really fun class. He talks about his stories and that annoyed some students, but I enjoyed listening to things I never knew about. If you want to learn, listen to what he says. Ask questions! He's very receptive to any questions", "Very unhelpful in getting students to understand the material- he needs to be fired and is a waste of our parents money", "Very nice guy and easy teacher. The work is not hard and he grades leniently.", "Worst professor I've ever had. His class was a waste of my time and my money! He never actually \"taught\" anything. He just went over possible test questions and gave you the answers every day. I will never take him again, and you shouldn't either if you actually want to learn.", "I did not like him at all! I rather have a hard Shenbagh,,, than an easy Poemro.. I did not learn anything in Class!", "He is the best proffessor I had my 1st semester. He is very helpful and approachable if you are willing to ask him ?s", "This class can be challenging and the lectures can be kind of hard to sit through but if you do not understand something, Dr. Ruchk and his TA's are always willing to answer questions after class and in their office hours. Dr. Ruchk wants to make you think and he teaches in a very different way. With that, you have to go to class to keep up.", "Orgo with Dr. Kelley is great, he is such a smart man and know just about everything there is to know about orgo. If you don't show up to class then I would suggest watching the lectures. If you don't do either then you're going to have a hard time trying to pass this class. The masteringChemistry homework helps! Do it!", "Absolutely ridiculous class. 100 pages of reading per week and the professor marks incredibly difficult. Hes a nice guy and you learn a lot but do not expect a 75+.", "Ed is great. I felt that this class was a little basic for him, and would like to have a more advanced class with him. He is extremely knowledgable, and has the crudentials.", "Super enthusiastic, loves the stuff he teaches. I would recommend buying the class reader book in the bookstore--take notes on it in class, use it to write papers, and study the bold terms for 30 minutes before the test and you will get an A in this class.", "He is a great professor. Explains everything clearly. The class was somewhat easy, but there is lots of reading involved.", "Really a good teacher. He's able to make sense of the many concepts taught in the course and doesn't ask tedious/picky questions on his tests. He requires many readings but that's a very positive thing. He's very effective from a truly educational perspective. Great teacher and person to talk to.", "I found Darren Hynes to be very approachable, knowledgeable, and efficient overall. I will admit that I was bored in his lectures and found that he did little to make the course interesting, but he marked students fairly and simply took all of the material straight from the book. He wasn't my favourite, but his course was relatively romper.", "Nice enough guy, extremely intelligent and good lecture notes, but his actual lectures are quite dry. He talks in a monotone voice and it is kind of easy to drift off.", "BEST professor.. 3 open book/open note tests.. lets u cheat.. doesnt take attendance after about first 2 weeks of class.. does a review before every test.. easy A [especially if u have smart friends =)]", "Horrible. One of the hardest teachers i've ever had. No matter how much i studied i never passed his tests. I even had a tutor...nothing seemed to work.", "He's a little man with a gigantic ego. Loves to hear himself talk. Definitely knows his stuff, but a poor teacher. Very poor.", "Excellent professor. Very passionate about what he's teaching. Involves class in a lot of discussion. Gives study guides that walk you through the test practically. If you give it some effort, it's not hard to make an A in any of his classes.", "He was recommended to me by my friends. They were right. A very interesting class and teacher. Many interesting and funny stories. A nice guy, but you have to study. One of the best.", "He was a funny, excellent professor. He made the material interesting.", "He is my favorite teacher. One homework assignment is due before each class. It takes about an hour, if you're focused. We watch videos and do interactive science activities online for lots of the homework assignments. I don't think anybody makes science as fun as he does. Attending class is important for quizzes. You won't find a better teacher.", "This is by far the worst Spanish professor I have ever had and trust me I'm a Spanish student, I was beyond fluent prior to taking this class and I love this subject. He is rude, arrogant, cuts you off. He cares about maintaining his image as a hard professor and that's all. His grading is arbitrary and highly subjective. DO NOT take this class.", "Great professor! Lectures are organized and assignments are clear.", "Have fun on moodle.", "LOVE THIS MAN. HE'S A LUNATIC AND ITS AWESOME. I STOP BY AND SIT IN HIS CLASS JUST FOR FUN. YOU THE MAN CRITELLI.", "If you go to every class and CL, you will get A- at least.", "I believe that ball belongs to Mr. Gilmore...", "The lectures were clear, concise, and they made sense. Prof. Kraay was well spoken and always knew what he was talking about. He could answer any question the students asked him about the material.", "Professor Levine is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He is a mean grader, a boring lecturer, and an ultra-lib. He gives very few comments on papers and is very hard to find outside of class.I wish I had never taken a class with him.", "Time flies by. Do your work and hand it in on time. Youll learn how to write and will enjoy the class.It was my favorite class.", "Very good guy, but unfortunately his teaching style caters primarily to students interested in pursuing very postmodern, nontraditional artistic methods; you won't hear the word \"technique\" thrown around too much in his class, but otherwise he'll be very supportive.", "Easy A, the difficult part is willing yourself to go to class. Interesting topics but he makes it boring. The papers are challenging as it is impossible to write a perfect paper in 2 pages double spaced while cramming in 8+ studies. They need to be longer, which I cant believe I would want. I would not take him again as I found it hard not to skip.", "Although the workload was intense and there was a ton of reading, I wouldn't hesitate to take him again. This man responds to emails instantaneously and you are able to get help in an instant. The assignments he gives for outside of class are very fun as well. His lectures are interesting but take good notes. Great professor.", "loved him in this class. he made the philosophy class what its supposed to be. wish i could have him as a teacher again. sadly i already have ethics done. he uses his own books that he wrote for text books so if you have any questions about the reading he knows exactly wht it means", "He is really nice at teaching. He won't mind at all even if you go and ask him the same thing thrice. TA's can be better. He grades well if you write your answers correctly. I amd my friends always scored more than what we expected.", "This guy's quizzes and tests are so ambiguous...not an easy class...i did poorly on everything and studied for each thing...", "Very fast lecturer and hard to understand. Will not slow down or help any student during class. Final was not representative of the quizzes throughout the year. Attendance dropped so low mediavision was added and extra credit given out to those who went to class. Avoid this class at all costs", "These classes are from before the department switched to 4 unit courses. Tim was tough at times, but really worked with students to ensure that they did well and understood course material.", "this teacher has no type of personality. His lectures are boring. He is not clear about what the assignments are going to be about. He is very unorganized. He doesn't care for his students. Attendance is a must. HE IS A HORRIBLE TEACHER. The whole class received no higher than a C. Avoid this class.", "The guy to take for either one of the thermo classes. easy to understand. very helpful outside class. my favorite professo at UA so far.", "Definitely the best english teacher I ever had. Listen to his comments and how he wants you to improve on your essays, you'll receive an easy A if you listen to what he says. He really wants you to succeed in his class.", "Knows a lot about history and admits that most of what he knows is useless knowledge. Read and outline the textbook and you'll be set for the exam. If you're interested in History take advantage of his strict grading and higher expectations of students, if you don't like History don't take his class.", "im a little sad to see so few reviews for sparks, he is great, alot of people hate him, with good reason, hes an antagonizer, he has no idea how to do anything other than make you feel something, hes not a teacher,hes a old man sharing all that he knows, and it may or not be alot, but he gets under skin better than a sliver, he does name drop, he d", "I would rather take a teacher that actually uses the textbook, believe it or not. The material he lectures does not even come from the book. Very easy to get lost.", "Great class. Great Prof.", "I dont know what that idiot was smoking or on at the time he/she wrote that, but Ryan although a very nice man is ridiculous as far as exams. I dont know what this guy is thinking but he needs to understand that not every college student has countless hours a night to put in to studying towards his class. We have other classes as well", "If you can handle a boring lecturer,then take one of the easiest SOC classes. The way to get an A is all in showing up and participating. The essays are a bunch one one pagers, super easy, and partly graded by TA's who quickly become your friends. If you want a easy class on a rocken topic, who cares if he rambels, your TA will clarify everything.", "DONT TAKE THIS PROFRESSOR. HE JUST READS FROM THE POWERPOINT AND HIS TESTS ARE VERY HARD!!!!", "I had Dr. Fonseca for an honors seminar, but he was very helpful and available to the students. He is very quick to email back and was very generous when grading our powerpoint presentations. He may be different as a regular professor, but I was very satisfied with him as an honors seminar instructor.", "Professor Gendron is probably the best professor at Assumption College. He gives you the honest truth and actually talks about stuff that is relevant to today's society. His lectures are extremely interesting and he is more than helpful during his office hours. But don't be on your cellphone during class.", "Mr. Doctor is a really great teacher. He is really open to people and is open about himself. At first, because of his personality I thought it would be an extremely easy class, but actually it wasn't. He grades papers more difficultly than in ENG 101. Overall, he is a great teacher though, you have to do work though.", "Excellent prof and very interesting course. Ta's sucked. I recommend this class b/c its one of the best i took. Professor Jenkins is very helpful and always willing to help students.", "DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! The class seems like it will be easy on the first day because you get take home exams, open note quizzes and most of the homework problems done for you in class. However, since Phelps does everything different than the book and doesn't explain things you will not learn anything. Which means the exams suck. AVOID!!!", "Impossible course. No help, just slides and lecture. Is very rude, annoying, and arrogant. Avoid like the plague if at all possible.", "Look im gonna be 100% honest...hes kind of weird yes. but hes a pretty good prof...his ability to teach is not what makes this class suck..its his ability to grade..he is an EXTREMELY hard grader and requires every decimal point to be correct..as other users stated..his tests are 10x harder then material.if your not bad at math take.otherwise avoid", "He is a really funny and good guy and I like his personality. Class was also cancelled a cancelled a couple time, so that was nice. The in class workdays are optional so if you don't want to go on those days, you don't have to. The feedback he gives is confusing and the answers he gives aren't very straight forward sometimes.", "Professor Dirks is the main MAN!", "I find his lectures very interesting and easy to follow. My marks are lower in his classes than any other though. I'd take his course again because I like what he lectures about and how he lectures. He also like Black Sabbath!", "GREAT teacher, reaally interested in the course material. Test's are easy if you study. Watch out for bonus points, if you answer incorrectly it is counted aganist you", "He was a great prof. Made the class very interesting and easy to follow. Able to really keep your attention, I really enjoyed the class.", "He is a good teacher very interesting and his lectures are not boring. He is quite funny.", "No Comments", "Stokesbury's mean spirited teaching style seems intent on discouraging his students from enjoying writing. He doesn't give you any grades on your poems until you get your final grade after the semester. I failed the course simply because I didn't turn in a second revision of my poems I had worked on most of the semester and he graded them as zeros.", "Great presenter and allows students to get involved. One of my favorite classes in my undergrad yet!", "I loved taking ACCT 1010 and 1020 with Prof Janicek!!! He really does care about his students and wants to see them do well. He doesn't use HW as a grade, nor does he grade it but goes over it in class. He took 3 grades for each of the classes; midterm, final, and a case study. He does give extra credit to use on the test which is super helpful!", "easy class, pretty interesting stuff.", "He's an ok lab teacher. The only problem is that he is not around when you need to ask questiones, he is usually in his office working on other classes.", "It's nice to have a believer teaching in a Dept. (Philosphy) that has knothing but secluar instructors. If your christian take him.", "Though the course is harder than most of the students head that go to that school, this teacher explains the subject almost as clear as it can be. Need office hour time, just go..he is always willing to help.", "Such a kind instructor. Long lectures but he keeps it interesting by asking questions, using photos/ videos (sometimes recent ones), and explains how it applies to you as a student. He always comes to class enthusiastic and ready to teach. Tests can be very long but if you study each chapter, and take good notes during his lectures you will pass.", "Excellent", "When I didn't drop the class like he asked me to he treated me with sarcastic politeness. He is unorganized, unreasonable, manipulative, and basically a jerk. He acts like he wants to help the students, but he is never genuine. His lessons are fine, but I will never take another class with him as a teacher.", "Bottom line: dont take him! he's an idiot and you will know less walking out than you did walking in. Grade is all test, no EC or HW. Doesn't give a crap about his students. You will be teaching yourself 100%.", "Very good class. Requires some studying, but questions on test are word-for-word from the book. EASY!", "His class is awesome. It is very interesting & you learn alot of stuff you can actually use. There are no real tests in his class, just a lot of assignments. I'd take him for any class, but I think all he teaches is Strategy.", "I had this professor for my stats class! In all honesty I struggled a bit but with A LOT of studying outside of class, I managed to pull an A thank god. He was a kind teacher who did care for my grade and if you put in the extra effort, will reward you greatly! He gave lots of opportunities to better test scores.", "The guys is fantastic. Really looking forward to his biker gangs class.", "No Comments", "very helpful teacher , i will recommend this teacher to everyone who want to pass the class .", "Lecture are incredibly long and boring", "Nonviolent warrior was a great class! I especially liked his lectures on Gandhi, MLK Jr., and Leo Tolstoy. This is a good way to get the IDS requirement out of the way.", "Professor Schneider is very enthusiastic about the subject he teaches. You need to get the books and read because he does give quizzes. Attendance is mandatory. Good professor. As long as you study and participate, you should do well. Good Luck!", "What a nice man! He cares about his students and is so helpful with assignments. He is very approachable and wants to help you when you adk questions or need inspiration. I was out sick for a while and he was so nice about it. Definitely take him.", "very boring class. pretends to want to get to know you, but he secretly wants you to think just like his interpretations. lectures are painful to get through.", "WORST TEACHER OF MY LIFE. DO NOT TAKE HIM. This class had nothing to do with philosophy and there is so much work it is ridiculous. You will be saving yourself so much stress if you do not take him.", "Reg is a great professor who is a master at working with students on their own terms. Where he lacks in organization and simplicity in his explanations he makes up for with his ability to make spontaneous connections to what you are interested in. He has an incredibly rich understanding of any reading material because he's read much of it 50 times.", "Political Theory was reading heavy but the tests were directly from the reading. One paper. Brings up interesting topics for class discussion; be prepared to think and defend ideas about what good democracy is, free speech, libertarianism, etc. Good class.", "I'm sorry but Bosworth is a horrible teacher. This is my second time taking Computer Organization, and again the whole class is failing. Do not buy the book because he teaches directly from his slides. His tests are unorganized and he hates answering questions. Try to find another study buddy that can help you because he really wont offer much help", "I'm pretty sure I took every class this man taught. He's a great professor and a very nice man. He will answer any question you think to ask. And definitely go to Greece with him, it was one of the best experiences of my life! Love, from a member of \"the animal group.\"", "Tests very difficult. Knows his poetry. Hope you like Patty Ann Rogers, \"rolling naked in the dew.\" And loves R. Frost. Leave class if he begins the \"food stamp\" story. Expect one of his own poems on the final.", "This professor loves teaching and really wants you to apply the information. The class is basically how to use the design principles to better your life and career - very motivational and directly useful for any major. And the class is an easy 4.0 as long as you pay attention to the details.", "Adorably dorky, but not a great teacher. What he teaches in class you understand, but his assignments - which make most of your grade - you can't understand. If you must take this class from him BE SURE TO COME TOGETHER AS A CLASS AND START A STUDY GROUP! Only way I have survived the semester.", "JC is an interesting guy but a TERRIBLE TEACHER. Makes you feel like you have to do what he wants on your own projects, says everything should be simple but then \"wishes you had put more effort in\" when the finished project isn't elaborate. Spends forever explaining. Gave me B+ though I followed his directions exactly and took all his suggestions.", "An exceptional and accomplished professor that brings education to reality. Great job!!!!", "He's a great professor; he goes into detail and explains everything to the T ! I'd take him again", "Seriously one of the best teachers I have ever had. Not only does he know communication, he practices all of the lessons in his lectures. I will be watching for other classes he instructs in the future to register for those. Be prepared though; there is lots of homework, but its worth it.", "Great teacher!", "If you are a serious student, or even if you are a slacker, Fred will amaze you. Fred is the ideal professor to do conference work with. Several times I have forgotten to speak in class because I loved listening to him talk.", "Took this last year but he was a very nice professor. He was very helpful and if you do exactly as he instructed and follow his outline then youll be fine. I was very anxious to take a public speaking class but I left the class becoming more confident in public speaking. 10/10 would recommend. Research matters A LOT.", "Doc is awesome. The man seems so bland on the surface, but every once in a while, he'll say something that'll just shock you (i.e. \"eat the elephant in small bites\")", "an incredible professor and one of the most intellegent in the entire school.", "I enjoyed the class, even though at times it was painful trying to keep my eyes open. But I learned a lot about journalism and how it is changing through the use of technology.", "If you show up for extra help when it's offered at the end of every week, you'll do very well. Otherwise, be sure to study the hell out of the material. It's difficult work, make it easier for yourself by taking the help he offers.", "No Comments", "Funny man. Tought me a lot. Good guy. Easy to talk to and work with.", "Not sure how he got the negative ratings, but the Prof was the exact opposite of what was stated on here. Prof was very clear, very good, and the class was really interesting.", "This was by far the hardest class I took for my first semester of college! Mr. Martin is a great guy as a person, but he expects way too much! His exams are all essays and he expects you to know every little detail! If you're ok with getting a C or lower take his class, if not, RUN!", "Very cool and understanding.... would recommend him anytime.... Also quite a hottie.....", "As others have said, Edgerton is funny. But that doesn't make him the coolest teacher ever. He goes on long rants and requires that you learn his opnions. His tests are unprofessional and he can sometimes be insulting to certain groups. He is easy and grades on a curve, but his class is very tedious. It's your choice.", "Tests are difficult. study. a lot. They're multiple choice format. As for the class, a bit boring. As for the teacher, also a bit boring. not a great class but not horrible", "Super helpful and very clear in his lecture and in his email. Very nice proff. and I would totally take another course with him again if I could.", "He was a really nice younger guy who knows what he is talking about. i really enjoyed the class. he is really helpful and very clear...hes also really cute! =)", "Dr. Hadley is a teacher of the past. Students can learn a lot from him, if they overlook his nastiness (which occurs a lot). He expects a lot from you, and he wants you to expect more from yourself. He is also getting older, so that is why he sometimes seems forgetful. Overall, a wonderful and funny man, who has an incredible amount of knowledge to offer.", "So Great!!!!!", "Cool guy. Very practical approach to the material. The first test made me think this class would be really difficult, but by the third exam I had gotten the hang of the testing level and grading style.", "Not a difficult class, but not the most exciting class either. He is a good man with an interesting sense of humor, although I find the material a bit dull. It definetely is a good class to take if you want a low stress but educational class for bibical text.", "There are a lot of readings outside of class but he covers the main ideas in lecture well. Papers are pretty big but manageable and he leaves feedback in a timely fashion. I feel like I learned a lot in both Law and the Courts and Law and Politics and would definitely recommend those classes.", "Professor Caspi was super cool at first but then he did a complete 180. He's a tough grader and doesn't help when he'll is needed, does give good feedback, but he is no help. I learned nothing from the class. It was mainly theory and psychologist based which takes a lot to understand but he didn't care if you were confused. Avoid him if you can.", "Definitely a very hard marker. If I had known what the class would be like I would have dropped in immediately. I think he would be better geared to graduate studies, as he clearly dislikes undergrads from his constant criticism of them. Wouldn't give out his email and office hours so after class help was impossible. Excessive amount of readings.", "Raymond is such a great guy. He really knows the industry and tells great stories. He really gets to know his students.", "be ready to teach yourself. doesn't prepare you.", "Great, kind, and caring professor.", "Clear lectures; straightforward expectations.

HE is relaxed and around if you need help. We appreciate you pork chop.", "Horrible. I can't stand sitting through his pointless lectures that don't even pertain to the material being covered. He mumbles on and on and he gives out too many take home quizes that are extremely time consuming.", "No Comments", "Daniel Kern covers all the material on a basic level, and though there is more he could say on the material, he doesn't, instead slowing the class down with long, ambivalent pauses. You don't learn much, and end up having a hard time with hard material", "I am a garbage programmer but this guy is a very good instructor if you have the ability to learn programming. Easy going, helpful, will do half the code for you if you are struggling. Probably the best introductory programming instructor you could get.

After this class, I'll never take a class with him again.", "Professor Amrine is extremely intelligent and is a wealth of knowledge and teaches Imagination with a brilliant structure.

I never post on online sites, but felt the need to convey how great of a lecturer Professor Amrine is.", "Great guy, funny in his own nerdy way, extremely awkward but seriously kind. You have to work hard for his class. It's not easy, has plenty of homework, but if you work, you'll get what you want.", "He was a great teacher and really hammers home the fundamentals. He teaches a student as if he knows nothing, learning from the ground up. I continued to go for repeated semesters because his love for music and teaching would rub off on me. He is the best Classical guitar teacher at PCC, hands down.", "Hamlet's course involves some incredible books, but it is an English course without discussion, and therefore isn't much of an English course. He is full of himself, redundant, and boring. His thoughts on each book could be much shorter.", "He fine tunes your stuff. No big revelations about writing except it takes time and lots of drafts to come up with good stuff. Very reasonalbe in research component. Funny guy.", "Amazing professor. First day of class he said he has 2 PHD's and it definitely shows. He doesn't lecture word for word from the book but uses his real life experiences to teach us. He is hilarious and kind. Super easy course and a joy to be taught by him! If you have a chance, take him.", "I'm sure HE knows what he's talking about but no one else does. And if you write papers you want to basically say what he said because no one else's view is correct to him. \"He's the expert\" - Can you tell I didn't really like the class", "I took Kojo Dei's class close to 15 years ago and to this day he stands out as one of the most influential professors in my academic career. I wish I had taken his advice and gone on for forensic anthropology at Columbia. He always made himself available for questions after class. Im not sure where the other comments are coming from.", "Loved this class! All you need to do is attend class/watch the movies he assigns and take notes. He tells you everything that will be on the tests. Great professor, very funny, and very knowledgable.", "Crazy Brit", "Hardestsmartest professor I've ever met in my life. He was even the co-author of our textbook that many colleges use, lol. I only earned an A in his class because of his incredible teaching ability. He will fill the entire board up multiple times per lecture but you better write every word of it down. He never gets off topic and always helps you.", "I could have gone into databases research, but this guy made databases the ugliest of my nightmares. He is dull and boring. His lectures are worthless. Last test was a disaster. Didn't cover more than half of it in class. His TAs are worse, barely speaking English and grading ridiculously harsh. Take Jermaine. Schneider is not a good professor.", "Sposito is great! Very knowledgable, clear, insightful, dedicated. He's just great.", "Easily the worst teacher I've ever had. His idea of teaching was \"Just read the book.\" He would look for any excuse to give 0's on assignments. I got one on the 1st assignment of the semester, not because it was late, but because I sent it as attachment in email instead using Blackboard. It seemed to me like he was only there to collect a paycheck.", "He provides you with great, practical information for teaching strategies. He is fun, articulate and knowledgeable. The classes require quite a bit of work and the mid-term and final are tough.", "It's obvious that Ian cares for his students & wants them to learn real world techniques that might save their lives someday. I'm much more confident in my ability to protect myself since taking this course. This was one of the very best classes I've taken as a college student. I highly recommend this course & this professor to everyone!", "He's an absolute genius of a man, and that's not an exaggeration. Take a class with him and you'll see for yourself. He also personally grades all of your papers, even though the class is very large. He will always help you out if you ask him, too. If you're at all interested in the humanities, you need to take a class with Frederick Amrine.", "The guy is smart but can't teach for his life. The math is EASY and the book is very good. So if your even decent at math then definitly take this course. Subjects include compounding interest, probability, election theory, etc.", "No Comments", "Very great, organized and straight forward professor.", "My best prof ever. Take his class if you can.", "This guy sucks. trust me, dont waste your time. If you have any shred of individuality, he will put you down and glorify his stupidity. complete waste of time. He should have been fired a long, long, long time ago. Happy New Year.", "Dr. Corvino is very smart individual and a good professor. His course was fair. There are a lot of readings so make sure to keep up with them and actually understand them. Four exams (all with the same weight) make up the grade, so prepare well in advance for them.", "very nice.If you listen and follow along then you will do well in the class.If you talk to him during office hours he is helpful.", "Very enthusiastic about what he's teaching, but sadly closeminded, although tolerant of dissent. Teaches pretty much to the book.\r Very generous grading policy.", "The most boring math lecturer I have ever had to sit through. He is absolutely not helpful in class or outside of it.", "This teacher makes all his tests and exams too long so that everyone fails because they dont have time to finish. And most of the stuff on his test r things he didnt even teach yet in class. He's completely disorganized.", "My advice: Don't skip class, do the homework problems, and ask for help if you need it. Horn goes straight to the tutoring lab every day after class and if you ask for help, he gladly will. Don't underestimate the exams. Try to study with someone else who is in the class. Teaching each other and learning together will help you more than book work.", "Yes, he OFTEN repeats himself and the class becomes repetitive and boring ,his lectures are poor. he doesn't notify students when he's absent.He's rude with no reason at all.If you want to learn business take classes somewhere else", "Highly intelligent and interesting professor. Be professional and participate as well as willing to learned something. Their is no right or wrong answer, so be involve and have fun doing it. The class will only be as hard as you make it. I will definitely take his class again. Honestly enjoyed every moment while able to take with me some knowledge.", "I was expecting him to be really bad, but to my surprise I had a lot of fun in his class. He is always joking around. However, he does not seem very knowledgeable on the subject matter and his tests were tricky.", "Professor is super caught up in his own opinions and thoughts on the material. He is incredibly knowledgeable but does not present the lectures in a way that is understandable to students unfamiliar with the topics. Final exam was released late in the semester.", "he actually cares", "He was intimidating at first but as time unraveled he turned out to be a cool guy. When he explains his demos he is very deliberate and clear. He is also willing to go over something you missed. My favorite thing about him was that over the course he would give little life speeches about maintain awareness. Very Nice Man and I overall learned a lot", "This guy is awesome. He was very helpful and patient.", "He was a pretty good teacher. The tests are a little difficult, but if you show up to class and take notes you will be fine. Really smart guy.", "DR. CHAPMAN IS A HIGHLY EDUCATED GENTLEMAN. HE KNOWS HISTORY VERY WELL AND TEACHES IT EVEN BETTER. TAKE HIM; YOU WILL MAKE AN A, IF YOU TAKE GOOD NOTES AND COME TO CLASS. HE IS EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE AND WORK WITH YOU AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE", "View lessons online as needed to learn the material because as previously commented he simply goes through powerpoint, but it does appear that the powerpoint is designed by him to accomplish course objectives. Project is huge so make sure you get a responsible group. After this class I was definitely more interested in Databases.", "One of the best professors I have ever had. If something was not understood, he stops and makes sure that everyone understands before moving on. He actually teaches instead of lectures.", "He is very intellgent and passionate. Sometimes he rambles but that is only because he really loves what he teaches. I enjoyed this class, wasn't alot of work and it really made me THINK!! That's what school should be about, no? Never a dull moment with this guy", "Dr. Ferguson is also my advisor. He is one of the best, if not THE best, teachers I've ever had in my life - not because of the content he taught me, but because of the life lessons. He cares about his students more than we care about ourselves sometimes. If you don't love PE, I'm sure you will after just a few conversations with him. Love him.", "Possibly the coolest prof ever, and he doesn't even know it. He is really into his teaching, but can get boring sometimes and put you to sleep. Midterms and exams all multiple choice and easy. The O'Brien's a genius. Who always wears jean jackets :D", "Turned me off law school.", "he is a really nice guy and is really funny..however for bio 102 he hasnt been the best teacher..usually posts important lectures online without explaining them and goes into a lot of depth on lectures that aren't that important..shows boring videos youre not tested on (pointless) and wastes class time..doesn't have his priorities straight.nice guy", "He thinks he is cerebral?", "Rick is such a great prof. I feel like I can just sit back and learn in his class! No homework or reading (2 chapters assigned but not mandatory) I dont see why anyone would object amazing lectures and easy A. Only downside is that he has cancelled class without email. Swears a lot! Very knowledgeable about worldly issues which is refreshing.", "I love Craig! His zoology class was really interesting and he's so adorable in a sweet nerdy way. Honestly he's my favorite teacher I've ever had! I just love his personality, however, His class was extremely hard for me. I ended up getting a C and they was a miracle. The tests where you had to identify species by their scientific names were horrid", "He was a terrible teacher. He could not answer questions. His quiz and test questions were unclear and there is never a word bank. He counts answers wrong for spelling. He took too long in the beginning of the semester and rushed through the end. We didn't even make it to the last 2 chapters. DO NOT TAKE HIM! Class started with 28 and ended with 9.", "tests are impossible! i would walk out of an exam thinking i did very well but when i recieved it back, i basically did very poorly. he's very picky with any answer given on a test or exam!!!!", "never attend and you will receive an A. Easiest professor I have ever taken, and one of the kindest.", "Overall, a solid professor. Class can be a bit dull, but the professor knows the material well and get it across pretty clearly. Assignments and tests are very fair.", "worst teacher. can't speak english. hard test although its open book. if you want to learn anything about statistics dont take this guy. also he gets mad and shouts at students.", "I LOVE this man! Its impossible not to learn the material! He honestly puts every effort into making you understand the material in an easy way! He has such a sweet personality & is very understanding! Stats isn't too hard but you should put effort into LISTENING and reading your notes. Completely COMPLETELY recommend this professor. He's the best.", "He is very practical. His class always involve real world cases. And he is a easy marker. I will definitely take another class with him.", "The material is extremely dull, but he really makes you remember that it is dull. He tries to confuse you, but you just need to write down every single thing he says. If you attend every class and take notes, you will pass. I studied a lot from the terms of words and it helped a ton even though his last two tests seemed foreign.", "He was a great teacher for BIO204 once you get use to his teaching methods. There is reading for every class with a study guide. The tests both lecture and lab, follow the study guides and lab reports very closely so if you study it isn't hard to do well on the tests. But the tests are all write on and you have to be able to explain. Fun Class.", "Took it as a summer class and found it fair. In each non-exam day we took a quiz (found online) that was easy to get 100 in. 3 exams were fair & non-****ulative. The only sucky thing... he kept us the entire 3 & 1/2 hours each day. We did watch some experiments so the time went by quickly. No point in takin notes b/c he everything is from the book.", "I took Jason's EmAC class years ago. Jason maintains that perfect balance of friend and professor. He knows how to earn respect from his students as well as give respect to his students. I learned a ton from Jason and his class really broadened my horizons as an artist and did so in a very encouraging way. Jason is an absolute asset to MICA imo.", "Great professor. Very smart. He realizes that physics can be tough and will help you out pretty much anytime that he has free time.", "Very easy. Has an attendance policy only because he has nothing else to grade or challenge you with. Easy A if you go to class.", "He's a good teacher and is always willing to help you out. If you had a problem with something, just ask him. DON'T RELY ON YOUR TA'S...mine sucked. He is very unorganized, but if you follow the book you will be ok.", "Great teacher. Very clear and super intelligent. Kind and cute. I learned a lot.", "One of the best profs. Really expects a lot out of the students and is stingy on grading, but you will come out of the class feeling as if you really learned something.", "I really enjoy the amount of attention he puts into trying to understand where his students are coming from. He is obviously passionate about his subject and has great practical knowledge which brings the philosophical concepts we study down to a workable level for Undergrads.", "Professor is very helpful, knows the material well and gives 4 take home tests and two projects. Amazing professor, worth the time and money!", "I had Fogel back in the mid 80's, and he sounds like he's still the same guy: funny, encouraging, remarkably insightful, and sparks insights into lit that I never had from any other prof before or since. Run, don't walk, to be in one of his classes.", "Very good, easy. Realizes that not everyone is an english major.", "Spears is one of those profs that has an almost legendary reputation among students. He's incredibly engaging, friendly, intelligent, and helpful. His classes are not easy. The readings are fairly long, but interesting. He expects high-quality essays, and his examinations require thorough knowledge of all the readings. And yet you'll still love it.", "I really hated econ in high school, but Professor Walker was much better at explaining it, and I actually like the subject now. I found the tests a little difficult, but not too hard.", "Could be more helpful in assignments. When taking tests they feel like a guessing game", "He is a wonderful and very intelligent man. He knows the subject very well. Some people do tend to get lost though because of the way he explains things. He might be too smart.", "Wasn't really sure about karate at first never took anything like it but this professor gets you through everything you need to know for every part of the semester. Anything you need to see he'll be glad to show you again and gives you all the review in the world for the final.", "No Comments", "haha this guy cracks me up. Laugh at his jokes and ur his new best freind. Test are okay, i never studied and still did decent. if u study ur set", "This teacher is full of himself and his family...he talks about his two sons all the time. His quizzes and test are super tricky, during lecture he goes offtopic all the time.Bio is hard enough and he only makes it worse.", "He was very good.", "The textbooks that he says you need are NOT a requirement, don't buy or rent them. You can Google a lot of the info. or use library resources. Teaching-wise, he's very passionate and kind. Pretty funny too and a little eccentric, which is always interesting. The class is VERY easy... movies every class. He's really chill and intelligent. Easy A!", "Professor allard is tough but fair. He is very clear and concise in his lecture presentation and will give you all the tools and support needed to succeed, while promoting academic independence.", "Prof. Strong is extremely energetic, makes sure everyone is participating throughout labs and lectures. If you put in the effort he will do the same. Skipping a class isn't the best idea, he does move quick but the book and powerpoint do help! He makes all of his tests and makes every question critical thinking (really tough).", "What can I say, Suetta is the man! East Asia is the easiest class during my week. Hilarious everyday. Very passionate and knowledgable in his lectures. It's crazy how he picked up his Asian accent. Look forward to watching the film \"Tampopo\"...it's hysterical! If you want a fun class with an almost guaranteed A, TAKE SUETTA!", "This is by far the worst professor I have ever had. He does a horrible job at explaining things, he lectures you when you don't do well on the exams, he claims the class is easy all the time which it's not, and he is so insulting. The reviews for the exams and study guides are completely useless. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!", "WOW!!! He was awesome and helpful! Loved his class wish he taught 1102.. Only wrote 5 papers and no final!!!", "good guy, a little conservative for my personal taste but comes with the course background. Has a mouth like a truck driver so if you are offended by language I would avoid, otherwise take him. Funny and entertaining.", "Tests very hard, failed everything except made a C on final and somehow managed to make a C in class, if you are having a hard time go talk to him about it act interested in his class and if you are a girl act interested in him and he will pass you, dress cute and flirt, but class is pretty hard", "makes an otherwise boring subject interesting and fun, i wouldnt miss his class if u paid me", "A crazy teacher with a weird way of expressing himself, but a great guy and im glad to have had him.", "No Comments", "Very interesting lectures, never boring. But sometimes speaks too fast, and hard to keep up with notes.", "Professor Dan is amazing. I understand sometimes he can seem as though he goinf off into a completley different topic but in the end it all relates. He is helpful, passionate, kind and caring when it comes to the subject at hand and his students. He one of the best profs at brock i throughly enjoyed his teaching style and him as a professor!!", "No Comments", "nicest man EVER, pretty easy too...", "I quit school because of him.", "No Comments", "He really knows nothing about what he is teaching, go back and get an accounting or marketing degree.", "Dr. Filson is a wonderful professor. I came away with an unexpected tremendous amount of knowledge about the Earth! It's a tough subject that he makes fun and interesting, and he's pretty forgiving in his grading. Do the reading and study guides, show up to class- you'll do well. I highly recommend him, and I'd love to take another class of his.", "You show JC the effort and he will respect you back. There is a lot of knowledge in his head and a genuine interest in the students. Once you demonstrate your commitment you'll be freed to take your creations as far as you want to.", "This professor is awesome. I'd love to take him for every math class I have to take at Kettering. His lectures are very clear and he's always willing to help.", "Great guy, always willing to help, would love to have him again", "dont take this teacher...it's all powerpoint presentations and doesnt hold study sessions of any kind. Not very helpful and boring. Tells random stories.", "Easy class. Makes the class interesting. I would recommend taking him.", "I found his lectures clear, although I found that I could teach the material to myself better. This professor took me before the senate on plagiarism charges which I was innocent of and he ignored me as a student after the allegation which was extremely stubborn of him. He has a rep for doing, watch out. I still thought he was a good prof thou", "I really enjoyed my class. Tim was very helpfull and the guidlines were clear. Wish I could have him for my next english class.", "Thought his class was great. Just do the reading and you'll be fine. Study guides are most of what will be on tests. Good class, studied well and got an A-", "You will not get a good grade if you do not read the book. His lectures make sense however the test covers much more material and in more detail than what he covers in class. Test do come off a bit confusing if you do not know the material. Not an easy A class, however you can pass without ever attending. Read the book and you will do well.", "Professor Lecker is someone who clearly knows what he is talking about from a professor's point of view. If you are not an English major you will find yourself being utterly confused and frustrated in this class. He isn't very approachable nor does he try to aid the student's understanding. When it comes to exams he is very vague.", "I've had some terrible teachers, but he definitely made it to the top of the list. I haven't learned anything about the actual course, but can tell you anything there is to know about his personal life and family. DO NOT TAKE. I repeat DO NOT TAKE unless you want to have a terrible semester.", "No tests, a few readings and a final project. Hilarious guy, would take again if I could, MUST TAKE", "Okay professor. He teaches at the beginning of class and then you do your own work. His tests are online, so better buy the code or you would not pass. The test is exact as the online work, so just review and you'll be okay. The only con is that he can be boring, but that's college.", "Very good professor overall, knows the subject well and is accessible outside class . Attendance recommended. Better start working on Coursework early", "Hugh is a great professor and is easy on grading.", "i want to be just like this guy... the best teacher i have ever had...", "If you show up for class and pay attention you can get a good grade in this class. Attendance is very important in this class. When a bunch of people skip class he sometimes gives additional points to people who showed up.", "Good prof, but would be a GREAT travel agent.", "Reading and writing. forget buying the workbook, but you do need the text. Another $ saving tip, dont bother with the CD either. Overall a b+ teacher. If you dont have a thick skin, pass him by. He is tough, but fair and you cant fail, if you work.", "this guy is just like a sales representative,and I didnt learn so much in the class. don't take his class unless you want to waste alot of money, if you do please find ways to get the textbooks for cheaper", "So cute and oh so young.", "Professor Lecker is an expert on Canadian Literature. He makes a real effort to help his students succeed. It's not at all an easy class and it really depends on the TAs that grade your exams. I enjoyed the class and would suggest it to friends. Remember it's not an easy A. You need to put in the work in order to do well.", "Awesome! Keeps you awake with his unique sense of humour!...Enjoy...", "Im not going to lie his tests werent easy, but if you went to class and took decent notes you should get a pretty good grade. The curve didnt help me much because I did good on the tests but if you do bad its a great help. I recommend him", "Ugh. Just tell me what you are thinking.", "ouch.", "This man is not an educator. His concern with his students and work ethic reflect a close minded individual. Awful time and worst way to start a year at college. If you take this class then you might as well drop it and try to get someone else.", "I'm an Economics major, so I was a little wary of taking Biology without proper preparation. However, I passed this class with an A, and with flying colors! Would recommend to all my friends.", "His class is fail proof! As long as you turn in all the excel assignments before the final you will be able to get full credit for them. That means you probably don't have to show up for the class. His assignments are very detailed which are meant to help you out. He tells a lot of jokes and is very sweet. Only a 10-week course!", "If I had known how difficult Potter was beforehand, I wouldn't have taken his class. He took forever to reply to emails, and when he did, he was rude and short with me. He took forever to grade papers, so you basically don't know where you stand in the class all semester. He graded very harshly on papers, and makes you feel stupid.", "Very tough grader. Wants everything done his way. I took this class online and unless you go to his office for every little thing, you get a bad grade, even if you email him. The comments he gives for essays are subjective and demeaning. Would not recommend or take his class again. Took research writing classes at university, they were easier.", "By far the best professor I have ever had! He made the class so much fun and interesting! The tests are pretty easy. All you need is to read the book and study the notes and you will do really well.", "This lazy, egotistical, unmotivated, sorry excuse for a designer has no business in a classroom. Take as little of his classes as possible, no matter what your focus.", "Easily one of the best teachers i've ever had. Very clear, helpful, and knows his stuff. Nice guy.", "Straightforward, clear, provides good lectures alongside films relating to the subject matter. Show up to class, sign in, listen and learn. NO tests, NO homework. Take home midterm and final papers as well as attendance your grade for this class. Pezzolo is pure class.", "DO NOT!!! AND I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE HIM!! HE MADE ME HATE BIOLOGY. HE EXPECTS YOU TO STUDY 6 HRS A DAY LIKE YOU DONT HAVE A LIFE. HE DOESN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS -NO REVIEW... AND 75% OF WHAT YOU STUDIED ISNT ON THE TEST. ONLY TAKE HIM IF YOU WANT TO SIGN OVER YOUR SANITY... WHAT A FREAKING WASTE", "He's a great teacher, but a little too much attention to the ladies in the classroom.", "I can't believe he does not have a hot pepper cuz this instructor is hot stuff. He can teach too. Fun class and funny guy.", "Boring..probably because it was a night class, but I must give him credit for trying so hard to engage us. He is quite the character and if you do the reading and assignments you're sure to ace the class. Assignments usually include going to the movies, a play, or museum and writing about it. (Easy right?)", "He gets off topic very easily and spends way too much time on something that should only take a few minutes. He does know a lot about his subject, but he gets so distracted and tells a lot of irrelevant stories. An okay class, but definitely not one of my favorites.", "Dr. Johnston is an incredible teacher. He motivates his students to practice and study by being an honest, talented, down to earth person. All of my classmates agree that other teachers at St. Rose could benefit from following Dr. Johnston's lead.", "Great teacher, but tough grader. Very helpful in explaining professional guidlines, clearly loves to teach others about photography. Decent sense of humor. Good class. Be prepared to take LOTS of pictures.", "Tony is an amazing teacher! For those students who don't understand the \"hype\" it is because some of us just don't get Chemistry but he makes us feel like it comes naturally. I dropped another professor & tacked on extra miles to be in his class & would do it again! I REALLY hope he considers teaching Organic Chem!! TAKE HIS CLASS!", "Great Prof. He will be missed!", "Took him a while back, left with a C- and tred very hard. Reason why my GPA suffered. He doesnt teach well and his exams are just brutal. If he is the last teacher available wait until next semester", "If you get him for con law (or any class really) be prepared to learn everything yourself as his lecture adds nothing. Really irritating man.", "If you are ready to work hard for your grade then take this class. However if you don't put a 100% you can forget about an A. In the end you would have learned something wonderful from both the course and the teacher.", "Super nice professor. You will learn alot from him. The labs are a bit difficult if you are in group A because you only have one week to prepare each lab and group B has 2 but he knows his stuff and is entertaining. Really cares about giving you useful information.", "Truly an amazing professor. Potter has inspired me to minor in Sociology just by taking his class. Attend class, take notes, and read the book. Doing all this will get you an A. He gives the essay question weeks before an exam. Super helpful, kind, and he really cares about his students. Wish this man taught every subject in the world.", "The guy obviously knows and loves this material..but as a person, he was just annoying and not funny. But overall, it's possible to do well. Just study...alot....", "this class is the worst IT class you can ever take. do not take this class unless you want to be a computer geek", "Projects are basically passfail. You either do everything right and get an A or do one thing wrong and lose at least 13 of the grade (more if it affected your output). Tests are open note but, again, you better make sure everything is right or points are going out the window. Lectures are pretty basic but informative. Good luck...", "great teacher..easy marker..tells you everything you need to study for the quiz", "Would never take again", "A genuine nice guy, he didn't even get mad when some idiot was shining a laser in his eyes. Hahah that was gold. A 1st year breadth required course is hard to teach and his knowhow is so above it that he comes off as boring, but props to him, I give him a thumbs up.", "He is amazing!!! The lectures are really interesting, the material diverse, and he really makes you engaged in the material. he is super helpful and flexible about papers etc- you can tell he cares about the students. if you take good notes and read the coursepack the tests will be easy. dont read the text book, its boring.", "I am terrible at math, yet I finished this course with an A. This was an online course - all assignments were open from day 1 of the semester so that students could work ahead. Extra credit opportunities for every tests. Professor Young WANTS his students to succeed. If you struggle in math, he will get you through!", "Funny Professor. Kinda quirky, but he delivers the material in a way that its interesting. Short answer exams that are straight forward and he give you some slack on the answers. Would take him again!!!", "Professor Hugh very funny and smart man. His class consists of papers only no tests and as long as you put your life experiences and emotions on paper correlating itto the material he will give you a good grade. He is a very easy grader oh no phones in class.", "No Comments", "Ron Cameron is the most amazing professor I've ever had. He is an incredible lecturer, and he is one of the leading experts in his field. He runs around the room, acts things out - you can tell he's extremely passionate about what he's teaching. He's also hilarious! Be sure to take a class with hime while at Wesleyan!", "Scripps is a great teacher. Some people new to coding might have trouble, but he's very available to help if you're having issues, as is the lab assistant and your classmates. Not too much textbook use, flipped classroom style was extremely helpful. Taking him next semester for 163.", "Alrighty... Where to start! I guess at the very beginning. The first class or should I say the first three classes were spent on just the syllabus! Seriouslly he read word for word... I forgot we are in college and can't read. Very rude to other instructors, not very computer knowledgeable. Took 2 classes to split class of 60+ in to 8 groups!", "Zeno is a very redundant teacher. Avoid if at all possible. He gives a ton of pointless work that is hard to keep up with, and doesn't really teach anything related to philosophy. Total waste of my time.", "what can i say about him! he is annoying when he snaps his fingers or goes \"euuuhhh\"..he comes to class disorganized..posts our hwk like 4 days before a test and expect us to do good when we have a million other things to do...although he makes me laugh a lot which is good compared to most teachers", "Not only this Professor Stevens the best Professor at York University, but he's the most articulate and most calculated with his words. Will not bore you with social and cultural history. 10/10!", "This class will not disappoint you. Vinnie is a brilliant, humble man and an amazing lecturer. He makes world politics interesting and dynamic in a liberal arts setting. Despite his MIT degree, he always emphasizes how MHC women are the best intellectuals of the generation to change the world. Very inspiring and awesome!", "Best techer I hever had, but he makes you work for it!", "Smart guy, lectures have a tendency to become dull and boring because of his speed of speech. Though I was very interested in the subject matter, I found myself on occasion having a hard time staying awake.", "two tests make your grade for the entire class - not bad but also not great. both are essay questions and its kinda hard to get at what he really wants on his tests.... otherwise attendance isnt manditory - however read the text! does give extra credit but gotta be there.", "Love this guy, great professor to take for sociology. The winter course is very condensed though (making studying for tests hard), wish I had taken him during a full semester. Lectures were great (you can record too) and he is very nice about getting you a free online book so that you can use it for the course. Also, it's hump days on Wednesdays.", "doesn't assign too much homework but tests are fairly hard ( of course )", "Genius!!! Sorry, David Is a hottie .... to bad I will never have a class with him again", "Dr. Millikin is a horrible lecturer. He has 4 favorite subjects that he talks about everyday and basically you are left to read the book yourself to know anything that might be on the test. He encourages people to ask questions, but when you do, he answers you like you are stupid for not knowing.", "Dave is a great guy. He really knows how to engage the class and make you extremely interested in what he is teaching you. He's tough but fair. Definitely the only professor you should be learning personal defense from. He is the man.", "the class was so boring. He is my worst teacher in my life.", "this guy has the easiest job i have ever seen... but he is a cool guy though so i would take this course with him. all you have to do is walk laps the whole time and you will get an A. he sweats alot, and ive never seen him work out, i find it funny", "this is one of the best teachers around i had to chem classes before him and knew nothing now after having him for just one semester i know a lot..def take dr snider..awesome guy and will help u in any way..also very funny chem humor!!!", "I count this class as a height in my college experience.

I look forward to taking him for future classes!!!", "No Comments", "Show up to class and take notes and you will have no problem passing this class.", "Dr. Frank made my science experience great.

I still remember the points he made utilizing those jokes.", "Just REMEMBER read the chapter before class and the cd rom helps I AM SELLING THE TEXTBOOK FOR $50 (sincerelynas@aol.com) He is a great prof. but he tends to forget that his students are not on the same level he is when he is explaining the material. His test are easy b/c the questions come directly from ex. in the book.", "His class was very laid back. You go in and get to listen to headphones, paint, have fun with it. After each piece, you put them up and as a class, discuss each one. Sometimes a bit harsh if he doesnt like your work. If you love art, take the class. Its fun, relaxed, and Mark is honest. Take the class, its a nice break from other classes!", "He will not look over any rough drafts for papers you may have. The electronic Journals are the biggest nuisances you will ever get. His tests are very random and rely on very small facts from the books you have read.

Easy class, and he's always willing to answer any questions you might have.", "At times, Dr. Harding can be a little all over the place. He is really interested in his teaching though and he really wants to motivate and excite his students as well. He is a very nice guy and is always willing to talk and help his students. He does grade a bit touch and there are quite a few assignments. Overall though, not a bad class.", "He is pretty funny but can be hard to understand due to his accent (he's Costa Rican). I think the biggest problem I had was that we would learn the material and have homework, then start learning the next topic, then have the test on the previous topic a week or two into the second one. It's more of the course's fault than his", "Very nice guy, good sense of humor, very helpful", "Alsop is the g.o.d. of bio at queens. he is very fair and a lot of fun to work with. i wish every professor had the enthusiasm of this guy.", "He is a great teacher!

He isnt helpful in the least, im not a fan of him.", "He was one of the smartest math teachers I had. I took calc previously and the stuff I didn't understand, he would help me. His tests are just like they say they are, so pay attention. Also he is very class-volunteer oriented to make sure that everyone understands", "Great Professor! Very interesting. Does lecture a lot but in an interesting way that keeps the class involved.", "I needed two hits of expresso in order to stay awake. His tests are extremely hard and the third test and final are on the same date...Half of my class failed him, I was one of the few lucky ones just because I can write good papers. He is brilliant psychologist, but he should not be teaching", "Midterm was extremely hard. Doesn't clarify what you need to be studying at all.", "African American Families could have been an interesting class but Jerome Taylor really isnt a good teacher. I do not suggest taking this class. dull, unclear, and just generally frustrating.", "Boring. Didnt really stimulate my thinking. Read material straight off powerpoints. Nice guy, but bored me.

Has a great sense of humor as well so he tries to make class enjoyable.", "Dr. Katz is an amazing teacher. He is engaging, witty,and cares about his students enough to have stimulating lectures. DO THE READING, b.s-ing your way through discussions does not work with him. He will push you, and it will not be an easy A. That being said, you will be better for it. You will learn more in class guaranteed. A MUST TAKE PROF!!!", "I would avoid this professor if possible....", "Great man and the work is easy! Busy work but nothing that you have to put your mind to too much and he is a fair grader.

Yes, he may not be the young hot-shot that buffs himself as the most contemporary astro-physicist, but he's a great professor.", "Magnifico Professori!!! Is what he said his name was the first day of class. His class is not hard. Pay attention on Review day for Midterm and you will do well. Same for the final. Its not a very hard class. He presents his information to where its easy to understand.", "Professor Sharif is not the professor to take dynamics with. We spend class going over future homework examples. While this may seem nice, our homework did not relate to the first exam. Also, when a student asks him a question in class he simply repeats what he has said before which is not helpful. I would not recommend him for dynamics.", "Easy online class.", "I had professor Zoccolilo for the online psyc110 class. He made the class very interesting. He asks questions and gives assignments that get you to thinking. His grading is very fair.

He also does not give feedback. Would not recommend to other students.", "One of my favorite UMB professors. I wished he taught every psych course.

His class lectures are pointless and you don't need to take notes because they give you no information needed for exams,quizzes.He is a hard grader but i find it hard to believe anyone could fail this class.Everything is out of the books and he lets you do all your work at home prior to exams,quizzes.", "He is an awesome economics teacher! I am taking another class next semester!:)", "Midterm and final make up almost all of your grade. Tests are essay questions he gives you the class before the test, he gives you 5 questions, but only two are on the test and you write about one. The questions are confusingly worded and have multiple separate parts. Personally do not recommend.", "So sweet and approachable. One of the best professors ever.", "He is one of the best teachers I had in this community college. Although he is hard, he is the fairest grader I have ever met. If you want to learn how to think critically you should take this class. He is very serious and isn't afraid to tackle very critical logical misconceptions. But if you want an easy A this isn't the class for you.", "lectures are boring, but you can still get an A if you sleep through them... but at times he is very interesting and funny", "Not a bad class if you have the right attitude. In fact, if you come to class and care about what you do, its pretty easy. Act like an adult and treat the professor with respect, and you'll find he's a very nice man. The text looked overwhelming, but it really isn't- just basic algebra.", "I heard that he was a good teacher so I decided to take his class for a fun summer course. Bad mistake unless you are really good at trivial persuit. Tests are rediculously hard. And is very bias when it comes to your grade and if he likes you.", "An excellent prof. always willing to go out of his way and assist students. Makes contract law interesting. More of a philosophical approach. Will definitely take future classes with him.", "ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS HERE @ BCC. Very nice man as well. He knows his stuff and makes it very interesting.

Fair amount of Notes but as long as you have em, this class is a breeze.", "BEST PROF. EVER! You will learn a lot. It is an inspirational class. He is one of those teachers who is difficult to find these days. If you want a great experience and well developed phylosophy when teaching, take his class! In my professional life I would always remember Dr. Orihuela.", "I dont understand the negative comments, no midterm no finals just a short reading everyday and short writing assignment. Easiest A you will ever get in college trust me", "Great professor and hilarious. I'd recommend taking him in the fall though.

Would recommend if you're looking for a class to fulfill gen eds.", "Dr. K is undoubtedly one of the best prof at DePaul. His course was very exciting, I learned a lot of things about the Catholic religion. He explained well his lecture and give us all the info that we need. In short,he is AWESOME ! Not to mention he is a very attractive and good looking man, one thing I regret was that I had him for only 5 weeks", "I have other Stats classes that I have taken to compare him to, and hands down I wish I would have had him first. He's one of the most understanding statistics professors I've ever had. Makes the lessons clear to understand, offers extra help in any way he can. The material is hard, but you leave understanding Statistics the way he teaches it.", "Professor is super easy so just show up, get the midterm and final (both are take home), and you'll pass with an A. He gives one homework assignment that's due at the end of the semester, and it isn't too time consuming.", "He's a very kind, sweet man. People are critical of him for no reason at all. He's clearly bright, and he's enthusiastic even when others are not.", "Keep up with the discussion boards. Answer the entire question and comment on othe posts and pj will get full credit.

Best part was not stepping foot on campus to complete this course.Self motivated students onl", "I enjoyed his first year class (HIST1010) so much that I just had to take his third year one, and it was honestly well worth it! He is one of the best lecturer's around and funny as hell.", "Took him for Accounting 1 and got a B. It was a breeze despite having another class during that period. You just have to contain yourself and you can end up with an A or a B.", "I loved Kurtz. He is actually the best professor I have had in my total education career. His passion for teaching makes you want to be in class. He writes comments on papers that are hard to read but he is pretty clear in his office hours and class time about what is expected.

Great professor!", "Mark Bryan is an unstoppable scholarly force. Because he actually works as a professional playwright, and actively learns from his students' research, he's becoming smarter at almost the speed of time.

He's hard as Hell but he is generous with extensions. Beware the final exam.", "Dennis and this class helped expand my interest in reading and understanding contemporary theatre. Certain projects could have been more thoughtfully assigned and graded.", "Great professor: everyone complains that he makes you sing and dance if you're late, just don't be late. He definitely broke me out of my shell and made public speaking easier on me. TAKE CHRISTIE! He knows what he's doing and does it so it's fun!", "No Comments", "He is an intresting prof, but his lectures are boring. However the class is pretty easy if you do the work, which is not much.

I'm taking him again in the summer cuz he told the class, if you want an easy class take in the summer.", "he over explains stuff to the point were even the smart students get confused he also does his math wrong sometimes and does not realize it unless you bring it up. Do not recommend! unless you like to argue with your professor or you are good at math. I got the highest grade in my class only because i taught myself", "all you need to do is write 3 papers that have good grammar and punctuation because he is big on that. you have to read all the books.", "Thought I wanted to be an econ major until I took this class. Some people did well if they made it their entire life, but I thought Frank was irrelevant and boring. His wording is nothing like the book so it was easy to get confused. He's not a great teacher but if you really need the course it's easy to get a C so take it Pass/Fail (S/NC at Pitt)", "I had him for Corporate Finance in the MBA program. It's a hard class but I felt my hard work was well evaluated and rewarded by Dr. Terry. Tests were very fair. I learned a lot.", "Foreman really knows his stuff and is beyond knowledgeable about the subject matter. The class is VERY workload heavy, with weekly case analyses, exams, and group projects.

Overall, one of my favourite professors in 12 years of university! Grills you like crazy but it's to make you a better Nurse and ensure you provide excellent and knowledgible care to your patients.

Use the textbook, listen in class and take notes, and I bet this class wouldn't be too hard.", "Very help insturctor. Made me see and think about ype different. I became more interested in design because of his insites. He assigns alot but the homeowrk is manageable and the projects are usually interesting.", "This professor is very understanding, patient and understands his material well.

You need to buckle down and read the textbook like its got the meaning of life hidden in it somewhere.Beware, exams are a killer!!", "Expects a lot from his choir, which is not a degree you can get here.

He is a nice guy though for sure!", "Excellent teacher. Very patient, allows corrections on most tests and assignments for credit.

It's true his tests are very difficult and his lectures are in depth, but he makes you want to do well in his class. Very easy to get help outside of class and makes it worth your while to go talk to him. He is also great for lab!", "Excellent teacher, and it shows he still currently teaches high school.

He is also the type of Prof. that gives student a break bc he knows how hard we work and that sometimes MHC can get really really overwhelming.", "Never had him for tutorial, but he is one of the best guys with whom to strike up a conversation. If Nietzsche entices you, Verdi is your man.", "I found this prof great.

Awesome class and teacher!", "Class was okay, not very stimulating.I didn't feel very interested and motivated to write, and held off on the first assignment till the very last moment.I was sure that my grade was doomed already.However, once I wrote more pieces and class was over-he gave me an A.So as long as you do the work and have great grammar, there shouldn't be a problem", "irresponsible, the answer of exam may be wrong, you need to check very carefully after you are graded, otherwise you will easily get a low score, since it is graded based on a wrong answer!! He is very irrespective to students, the standard for project grade is very unclear, if you argue with him he will satire you and let you shut up!", "Irvine made the course much more enjoyable than the topic alone. Content was fairly interesting but not riveting. Most fair and clear exams and grading criteria I've experienced so far. Incredibly helpful and approachable in office hours. You need to study to do well, but you 100% get the grade you earn, which I love. Irvine is fantastic!", "Although it was a super easy class, he made me hate the subject. He rambles on too much and his notes are all over the place. He does have a good heart and tries to get his students involved in learning, but he yells a bunch. Attendance isn't mandatory, but there is in class quizzes almost every class.", "He is an angry, angry, man. But he is smart. He knows everything about the subject, but he just can't teach. He wasn't born to teach. Simple as that. He hates being interrupted and will literally yell if he is disturbed. Don't be late. but I advise that you take someone (ANYONE) else!!!", "I love Lombrana. He is an excellent teacher and makes difficult subjects easy and interesting. He has lots of charisma and is a pleasure to have as a professor. And he has a really cute smile.", "such a great guy and a great professor. i've learned so much and he's so interesting and fun.", "Knows his stuff when it comes to History of the theatre. Also very thorough in teaching directors what to consider when taking on a play.", "Good over all, just be prepared for A LOT of reading very quickly!", "Immensely helpful! The essays are actually fun to write because he gives broad topics. Super chill. Extends due dates, as long as you talk to him. AWESOME PROFESSOR! Would totally recommend!", "Very nice man, but has no business being a teacher of any kind. would actually guess at answers to questions that i knew were incorrect. very boring class also. just read to us off a powerpoint. i learned 10 times more in high school chem.", "No Comments", "The average on the final was a 61. That's all I have to say.", "Very funny man. He offered alot of great tips on teaching. I would recommend him.", "We're not even 6 weeks into school and I'm dropping this course. This is the only time I have ever needed to drop a course mid semester. He is an absolute idiot, never stays on topic, and repeats EVERYTHING 15 times over. DO NOT TAKE HIM YOU WILL REGRET IT. He needs to be fired stat.", "Best teacher I've had a Wesleyan. His enthusiasm for the subject was infectious. I went into the class thinking I was going to drop it because the first reading seemed dense but he manages it to make it interesting and enjoyable. As long as you do the reading and take advantage of office hours when something is unclear, you'll be fine.", "No Comments", "This class is an automatic A if you do you work the right way which is really easy. Not to mention, there are extra credit opportunities given so take advantage of them. The test grades are based on a curve; but they're really easy. I highly recommend Enomoto. So take this class!!!", "Prof. O is such an inspirational teacher!! I love being in his class. I've learned more from him than any of my other teachers EVER!!!! I really enjoyed his enthusiasm and charisma. He clearly is passionate about what he does. I hope FIU \"wises\" up and hires him full time. I think he would be an exceptional grad. school professor! BRAVO, PROF. O!!!", "Ethics not very ethical. Unable to make office hours- -had a mandatory attendance class at the same time. Despite this, I did see Panos a few times so he could review my essays. I followed his recommendations exactly and still got a C. Couldn't win.", "He's one of the good teachers. Definite must take as a teacher for any one of his classes.", "He wants to cover too much stuff in this class. Because of this, in addition to the lecture material you have to master the bones and muscles without a throrough review in class. Lecture was interesting and fun, but the powerpoint slides arent descriptive and neither is the study guide. Suffice to say i read the book and used wikipedia ALOT =)", "His lectures can be boring at time, all he does is lecture the entire time and the tests are essays based on mostly the text, some on lecture. However he is SUPER approachable and willing to help as long as you ask. He has been the most helpful professor I've had so far, he wants all his students to succeed you just need to reach out to him.", "This is the most frustrating class I have ever taken. He literally does not teach. He gives you \"chemactivities\", and you are supposed to learn from your fellow students. The only plus is you get multiple chances to get the correct answer on tests(it's on a computer). I would not recommend him at all.", "\"I am mad as hell and not going to take it anymore!\"", "His way or the highway. Get out while you still can.", "Professor Allen is an amazing individual! I would definitly take his class again! He made it fun to learn about all the boring things of english!! Be sure to purchase one of the books he wrote they are awesome!!", "he's a nice guy, very interesting class, tough but do-able", "don't. just don't. trust me.", "The worst professor I've ever come across in my years at U of T. I would give him a 0/5 but it is not possible. Right from the get go, his ego is apparent. He does what suits him, and to heck about anyone else because of course the universe revolves around him. He's sad and I pity him. Save your money and time, and take a course with a better prof.", "This cat is da bomb! We had a blast!!", "Great guy and knows his stuff. He clearly defines and shows everything either on his projector or the board. Really good at explaining things. Keep on top of work or oit will overwhelm you!", "First day I was in class with Mike he had sooo much energy; I felt like I was in the army(he wasn't mean, just excited). After that day he calmed down, though. Mike is a very enthuastic instructor who loves what he does and helps his students a lot(especially in preparing for labs and exams). Just keep him away from sugar ;) ! I enjoyed his class!", "Seriously who does this guy think he is. Doesnt Have his PhD. but still thinks hes god. If you want to get through the class, tell him off the first lab, or he will lip you all year, stand up to him and you will be good to go.", "Great teacher. He is very clear in class and really knows his stuff. He is a little intimidating because he does expect a lot from his students but his high expectations keep his students working hard. Worth the effort this class requires.", "This \"professor\" should not teach. He does not actually care about whether or not his students fail. He does not give instruction but rather is a grader. And when he does give feedback it's not productive, he just tells you what you did wrong. There is no helpful criticism. He is just out for an ego boost.", "BEST TEACHER EVERRRRRRRR!", "Best prof I've had so far in my studies. He takes genuine interest in his students success the likes of which I've never seen. He will move mountains to help a student learn the language, if that student is genuinely interested. If they aren't, then there's nothing he can do for them. HIGHLY suggest Avdulov sensei if you want to learn the language.", "LOVE this professor! His accent isn't thick at all compared to many other professors I've taken. He's really helpful and tries to make sure everyone understands the problems before moving on. and he's really funny! I would definitely take his class again!", "Never had Daniel in art classes but had him once in a critique. He's not easy, going straight to the problem and asking me to defend myself nstantly. I like art teachers that actually tell you what's right and what's wrong.", "I thought he was a great professor. We only had three paper assignments which were fairly easy as long as you did the required reading during the class. The papers were not long at all, and our final was really, really easy! I would definately take him again. Don't listen to these other ratings, he is a good professor.", "Me Stettnar is a really good teacher. His lectures are very understanding.", "Highly recommended to anyone! Dr. K is literally one of the coolest professors I have ever run into, mainly because he is just a wonderful human being. He is so intelligent and so compassionate and he understands the way that education should work. I wish I could have him for more classes. If you are a smart cookie you will take his class!", "Excellent teacher! Plan on doing a fair amount of homework and making sure to come to class, but you'll learn a lot.", "GREAT PROFESSOR! MAKES CLASS EASY AND FUN!", "Not a fair grader. Shows a lot of bias.", "Great Professor. Great class. I would deffinetly take another class with this professor.", "Tim is a great teacher and is very easy going. He will work with you in any situation to make sure you do well. The only way to fail is by attempting to fail. If you breath and listen you should do well", "Great teacher. I had him once a week for like 3 hour periods, but he managed to make the class really interesting. Tests were pretty simple, plus he drops your lowest score, along with a few quizzes.", "No Comments", "Very open-minded and articulate. He'll be there for you when you need it.", "Got off topic quite often; lectured too much. If you are already proficient in web design, it's a very useless class. Visual Explanations is absolutely above the students' general intelligence level; many complained. You will fail if you don't read for the exams. Projects are very easy if you know web design.", "Great lecturer. Tough grader.", "His class was cake. We were scheduled to meet MWF but we only ever met on MW. His class is easy and you don't really have to do anything to do well other than your wellness project which still isn't that hard.", "Shane's a hilarious teacher, he always wanted to take the time to help out students do the best they could. If you try in this class its an easy A.", "Bob Coleman is not a teacher. He gets off to embarrassing his students. If you take this class don't raise your hand because if your wrong he will belittle you. He will spew useless amounts of random knowledge to make you think he is a genius. A teacher is meant to guide his students not destroy them.", "Dr. Hardy has been the WORSE math teacher I have EVER had!He does not explain the information well AT ALL! If you wanna actually pass this course, DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! He has no remorse for any student, although unless your black! He also does not explain th infomation well at all, along to go with that he tends to mumble!!!", "Kern explains everything very clearly and is always available for help. He is quickly responsive to any email questions and keeps the class updated on any questions/answers via email. It is evident that he cares about the success of his students. Very approachable and kind. Very lenient grader w/extra credit available if needed. Highly recommended.", "Prof. Sierra is an interesting man; nonetheless, he is pretty awesome. Definitely knows his stuff. Always there for me when I emailed him regarding essays. Show up to every class ON TIME (he hates ppl who are late), complete all 3 essays on time and do your best on the quizzes. Overall, if you can write essays you can get an A. Fun class for sure.", "funny guy, doesn't take this class too seriously. Also doesn't grade too hard, just make sure you put a lot of \"feeling\" into your essays. The papers are easy, b/c all you have to do is write about yourself, no research required. I'd recommened him, definitely.", "Dishonourable treatment of students. There should be punitive measures for his behaviour.", "He really gets down to buisness. Class always got out a few minutes early and he always got everything in. Hes very helpful if you need help just go to him. The only thing that can be a downside is he went very fast. But if you ever missed something in the notes he was willing to give it to you after. Take all the notes and you have no problems", "All in all, a very good professor. The lecture can get pretty boring at times, but, it's all very clear and structured and there are never any surprises. If you go to class and pay attention, you will do well. Also, his sense of humor rules.", "My favorite teacher ever! I love him!", "Hyde is probably my favorite professor at SPSCC. He's interesting, engaging, and knows what the hell he's talking about. His stories spice up his lectures and the information he shares is really interesting. I learned more in the classes I took with Hyde than in any other classes. And it was incredibly easy. If you're on the fence, do it.", "I really enjoyed this class. He is a great professor, should teach more classes. Emails notes and gives an awsome test review. Makes class interesting and fun. I really like him and would def. recommend him to anyone!", "Such a great professor. Sweet and funny guy. Loves economics and traveling. His voice is sort of boring but he keeps his lectures relevant. Tests are mostly multiple choice and he's very realistic. Big on learning the material instead of testing like crazy. Loved the class (honors section).", "Whether or not you like him will depend on your style. Dr. B gives a lot of hw and tests frequently. This is actually helpful because you get a lot of opportunities to make corrections to your grade. 7 or 8 tests total, 3 of which are in class with a group. He talks a lot and often doesn't finish lecture, so prepare to spend time in the TA help lab", "Good easy professor. Just do the work and you'll pass. He assigned only two papers throughout the semester and all we had to do was revise/peer edit them every few weeks. He also teaches basic grammar which was extremely easy, and it helped me improve my writing. He can be a bit boring with his lectures though.", "I'm a senior and this is the first and only class I've ever had to drop! This professor is rude, demeaning, and belittling to students, not to mention misogynistic. Ladies especially, steer clear unless you enjoy **** comments. I loved Spanish before this class and now I'm hoping it hasn't been ruined for me.", "Here's a new concept students should try: Studying. In order to pass his class, one must actually study, he teaches the material and it is up to the student to try to understand it, you actually have to use logic in his class not just learn definitions. Although he doesn't check the homework, it is the difference between passing and failing", "Peter, Peter, Peter. Good class, but thats about it. very straight forward and if you aren't going to do the work don't bother with the class. He expects you to know everything and if you don't its your own fault. He's cool until you do something wrong, then you get slammed for it and spoken down to like your an idiot.", "David really cares about his students and their success. He does require lots of reading, but it is all very interesting. If you love history you like this class. He does have lots of papers but most of them are 1 page papers. He has options to do service learning or outside learning for extra credit and allows revisions of papers. Amazing teacher!", "Don\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b4t take class woth him if you can. Is very hard, he tries to be very helpful but the examn is not like the homework so is hard.", "He is honestly the best professor I have ever had at Dutchess. I've been going to Dutchess for two years and out of all he professors I have ever had he is my favorite. He has a very thick accent, but he makes fun of it himself so it is all out of fun. He truly cares about your education and he wants you to do well. Absolutely amazing.", "This class was not as difficult as everyone is saying. YOU MUST READ THE ASSIGNED CHAPTERS or you will not pass. His test are difficult, but the other assignments were basically free points. The forums are opinionated, and the research paper isn't too bad. He seems annoyed if you email him.", "I have attended 3 schools, and Todd is the best professor I have had at any of the schools. I was not really interested in the class content at all, but he made it interested anyways. His lectures are hilarious they are better than sleeping in.", "I liked Ruben and what I learned from him. You just have to learn how to listen to him.", "Richard Davis is perhaps the most brilliant and challenging professor in this field I've ever had the honor of studying under.", "Excellent teacher, good lectures. However he is a hard grader and his tests/quizzes are difficult", "I've never dropped a class, never not had a 4.0. I walk into his class first few days are good, a lot of handouts given, but i loved his lectures, he made the topic fun and enjoyable to learn. BUT YOU HAVE TO STUDY YOUR BUTT OFF. TESTS ARE REALLY HARD. MANY OF THEM. THEY ARE LONG. If you want a challenge, have him as a teacher. Don't recommend", "Good professor...excellent director.", "Dr. Lombrana is the best!!!! He really cares about his students and wants them to do well. If you are lazy or don't show up to class, you will not pass this class. You will need to study his PowerPoints a lot.. but he does a great job explaining things to help you understand. I will be taking him for as many Biology classes as I can!", "Bush is the type of guy who only wants to hear what he wants to hear. He doesn't like when people correct him and he assigns many assignments (multiple due on the same day & sometimes forgets they were even due). Also, his favorite thing is calling on every single person in the class and putting them on the spot with questions.", "The coolest Professor I have ever had.", "I am not sure if he is the best professor, but I can definitely recommend him. He makes statistics interesting and easy to understand. I never got bored in his class. Needs to work a bit on pacing the lectures as difficult sections were rushed through....", "This was a hard class and I had to spend a lot of time studying but it was all worth it. He's a wonderful teacher and I would take him again if given the chance. As long as you study for this class there is no way you could fail.", "Lots of real world practical experience.", "I didn't hate him. It was a HARD class so if you are not a slacker and like geology then this is the right class, otherwise find an easier science class and more interesting teacher to fill your credits.", "Prof Panzarella is firm but fair. He lets you determine your grade thru attendance, quizzes and writing assgnmts. He gives no breaks and very strict but as long as you don't miss anything and complete all your work, you will do great. I had a problem understanding an assgnmt and he explained it to me so that I could understand it better.", "Wow. Where to begin? Leon rambles, endlessly. When he does speak directly on a piece of poetry, its a miracle if he has something important or poignant to say. He's rude, an ass, and in no way at all helpful. He's also too self-assured to ever be wrong, so do not disagree with him or your grade will be affected. One of my worst Professors, ever.", "Professor Bergeson is an entertaining lecturer and his class is set up to help you succeed at physics. You will have to learn some of the material yourself as not everything is covered in lecture. Go to the TA lab if you are stuck", "Excellent Prof Helpful Knowlegable Knows how to teach Helps students Succeed Even helpful with improving your writing Travels widely Published Knows \"insider\" info on many businesses Great teacher and invaluable resource for students who want to learn & get ahead HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "Really a nice guy! I've taken him twice now, and just had a blast. Socialism was very difficult, a lot of the theory material was waaaaay over my head. But he will stop class to explain all material, and some side stories as well. Those are the best!! I feel like i learned more from discussion than actually reading. He's really a great professor.", "Good teacher. If you miss class you will get set back. Must read the book in order to make good grades on the tests. Each class is lecture based. Mid terms are pretty clear cut. Just like any other history class. Not hard, but you have to apply yourself.", "He challenges his students and tries to get students to go beyond what was written in the case and think about the larger concepts surrounding contract law. Clearly explains complicated topics. Not an easy marker but not impossible.", "He is a horrible professor. His website is as awful as he is. http://sandlight.com/ \"design patterns are such stuff as dreams are made on\" is his catch phrase on his website. That doesn't even grammatically make sense, never mind the fact I have no idea what it means. I don't know how he can criticize anyone else's website. He is cocky/rude. AVOID!", "Dr. Pecorino is incredibly smart - there's no denying that. However, often times he forgets that he is teaching college students. do the study guides and you'll be fine for the tests. Go to lecture and MAKE him explain. The final however was awful. I scored above a 90 on every test and barely got a 68 on the CUMULATIVE final (35% of your grade).", "I'm not a math wiz, but Mr. T makes everything quite easy for his students. Come to class, take notes, take the quizzes (3 points each), then take an almost identical test the next class after a nice review of the quiz. Notes are allowed for all quizzes :)Although he is sometimes hard to understand the textbook and his teaching method make it easy.", "Dr. Critelli is an absolutely amazing professor! He makes you critically thinking and challenge yourself beyond your expectation at every class meeting but its is very well worth it! Take goood notes, for your notes are your study guide. He is extremely helpful and if you're completely stuck he allows you to call him.He is by far the best professor", "lodi dodi", "The Best Senior Project Prof. And the hardest to get. He has tons of knowledge.", "Gerry was pretty much awesome. The class was 9 am, Monday to Friday, and I never thought about sleeping through it. Take him if you can!", "the best professor i've had so far - makes mythology fun and easy to remember. i will never forget the voices!", "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will have a better understanding of humanity. Amrine is incredibly intelligent and really helpful. His lectures are full of interesting notes on history, science, music, art, religion, etc. Lots of reading, but it's manageable and worth it.", "He seems intimidating, but throughout the sememster you will learn a lot of things..this man knows what he's doing and trust me, read the book before each class you will know what he is talking about in lecture and can make things fun for u...for a subject like anatomy...you will be fascinated because he is fascinated about anatomy, study for an A.", "hard to understand and doesn't help you out. 2 exams. midterm and final. exams are hard. i got my first and only D in this class.", "Dr. Calderon isn't the preaching Mexicanism, his students are. He is a great professor- his classes are based on open discussions of the readings. As long as you read the books, you are fine. I'm pretty **** and did NOT want to take this class but had no option and still made a B.", "Class is very fair, tests are meant to be passed. drops a test and 2 quizzes....take good notes and you will get an A", "does not stay on topic very boring", "Good professor. No doubt that he really knows Chemistry. He is however, fast paced and loves to hear himself talk. Participation in his class is not very encouraged and he enjoys humiliating students. He refers to himself as \u00e2\u0080\u009cSkip\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which is a little disturbing to say the least. Yet, he remains the best Chemistry professor at NSU in my opinion.", "Great teacher. Absolutely one of the best teachers I have ever had. He attempts to make things creative and challenging while also making sure we are learning.", "I <3 p.wilson. Extremely passionate about math and the sweetest professor I know. Easy class, can re take midterms, turn in late hw, and has tons of office hours. Take him! He's awesome! ..Too many kids goof off in class as if they were in high school still.. please be respectful and don't take advantage of him (=", "Dr. Andy Jones is a great Professor! He always had extra office hours in Downtown Davis. He is really helpful. Although he is a tough grader, its only because he wants you to be a better write. You will learn a lot.

It's a class I never wanted to miss.", "this guy sucks. he reads off some powerpoint slides he has but he tests u on the whole book and then picks the most random stuff to test you on... he is def not easy and is extremely boring", "took his honors class, i used to like sociology before i had him, he could not be more full of himself, AVOID HIS CLASSES", "No Comments", "Dr. Baker is there to inspire you. He teaches you about introductory Aerospace Engineering, but what he really wants to do is to inspire you to succeed in life. He really does this well, and he enjoys what he does. He's always willing to help even with his busy schedule as department head. Attendance is 60% of the class so if you show up, you pass.", "I am currently in hell in this class. Not only does he look like a St.Bernard, but he speaks very slowly and quietly and takes lots of pauses in his sentences. It's hard to pay attention. You probably won't be too motivated to go. It's boring and the midterm is the first test of the semester.", "No Comments", "Great Teacher!! Very direct and tells you up front what he likes and dislikes.

Test are easy, just review ur notes.", "Even though he writes fast, but he speaks loud and *very* clear in class. He is a good professor.", "2001 grad. I honestly used a lot of the info from his courses in my masters and for my psychology license. I really appreciated how he didn't fill up class time with BS and actually provided practical material.", "Mr. Howard was a great teacher. Laid back and easy-going. He's the type of guy that you could go to a bar and get a beer with. Learned a lot from him.", "This class does require a lot of work because you have to keep up with new plants learned every week in lab (lab= going outside to state parks, etc.). I was really overwhelmed at first, but it ended up being manageable and if you put forth some effort you can get a good grade. Nelson is so nice and fun, and I enjoyed this class overall.", "He is seriously the worst man alive. Not helpful, very rude and arrogant, and does not link topics to class", "Fun and knowledgable person. Taught the easiest ways to do Binary numbers and made circuit schematics look like cake while others won't know squat. The only downside is the time of the class and he makes you stay up til 9:45 in the evening.", "Shane is a great teacher! He always makes sure everyone understands and is totally willing to help with problems, even if it means looking into it after hours for a student. His lessons are clear and leave you prepared to complete the labs and in class assessments.", "Terrible teacher, at least online. Completely unwilling to actually help. Anytime you ask for help he just refers you back to his online content and accuses you of not doing any of your assigned reading. I tried to meet with him at his office and he basically told me no, his feedback was clear. When asking for help he's rude and disrespectful.", "2 papers, 2 exams...pretty easy class and he's a nice guy and knows what he's talking about.", "For a class with Freshman non-English majors, the class was rough. He expects a lot from his students, and you have to work to improve your grade. There was little substantive feedback on the essays and in class; the classes were more discussion based. He expected us to comprehend and work at the level of Juniors or Seniors.", "Got an A", "Boring lectures, makes you work too hard for the grade, taught an under-grad level course for grad students, exams are too lengthy designed not check your knowledge", "Camilo is one of the best professors, but he makes you work really hard.

Take this class if you want to have the time of your life, while learning basic computer skills.", "Dr Hardy is extremely rude. He will laugh in your face about questions you ask. At one point he told me he wasnt talking to me anymore. Also he is not willing to work with you when you have a issue. Our online system calculates grades wrong I received a D but if you calculate it it adds up to a B he still wouldn't fix it. Saying it wasn't his issue", "Interesting material but sometimes you'd have to strain to really be interested in it because his voice is monotone like others said. He's not a prof that's readily available to help either so you'll have to go out of your way. There are better professors.", "Dennis is the best. He's a wonderful teacher and he truly cares about his students. He is always there when you need someone to talk to, cry to or get advice.

DO NOT TAKE HIM! EVER!", "I studied my butt off for weeks before exams (books, previous tests) and still got blindsided and absolutely bombed the tests. Withdrawing was better than risking my GPA on \"maybe he'll scale it because he did last year.\" I even went to him for guidance after exam I & was talked down at and shoo'd out of his office. Talk about not caring.", "Excellent professor. Interesting practical class applicable to real life! Exams and assignments were straightforward and expectations were clear.

He is always willing to help.", "No Comments", "Dr. Bakker gets a lot of negative reviews, but I absolutely loved him! He can be a bit condescending if you ask stupid questions, but do the reading and it's an easy A.

You must attend every class bc there's always something relevant to learn each day.

Tests are so easy, as long as you put in effort and show up, youll be fine", "Took his intro class and when he offered Business of Media, I jumped to take another class he taught... even though it was 930am on a FRIDAY. He's an amazing teacher and really supportive if you reach out to him. Didn't need to use the text book much and he was a pretty easy grader if you generally participated and did your Blog entries.", "One of the few professors who can keep the attention of the class throughout, partly due to the need to write down so much of what he says. Interacts well with the class, through humour and catering certain lectures to student interest, if time permits. Extremely knowledgeable, and lectures are well-organized. Talks fast, and expects you to keep up", "There is three exams, all online, and two one page single spaced papers. I didn't read the book once or any of the assigned readings and did just fine. You do need to study for the exams, but if you take notes you should be fine. He can get sidetracked and sometimes the lectures aren't that engaging.", "If you are bad at math just do not take his class at all. He is a nice guy, tries to be funny and joke around. But as a professor he is just horrible. he cannot speak English properly, he knows math, just cant explain it. He does not like confrontation either, if you talk to him about something he will take it personal and make your life hell.", "Seriously, anyone who complains is someone who just doesn't care. J. Tarski IS a little hard to understand, but you get passed it after 2w. He has such a big heart & tried his best to answer any questions to the best of his ability. He also encourages the Math Res. Center! Quiz/Test open note. Take him if you're serious about learning!", "Best math teacher I ever had. Also teaches some of the history of mathematics, this is extra knowledge that is hard to find anywhere. Nice, Nice professor.", "He is WAY too much work for a 1 credit class. Shegnoski was nice, helpful, and much easier.", "The BEST!", "mr daniels seems hard at first..but contrary to what you read you can easily get a B or an A...he has no homework only 5 tests 1 final that is the same weight of the tests & drops the lowest test score..offers 10 points extra credit that he adds to your grade so if you have a 70 add those 10 points u get a B.the extra credit is simple! he is corny", "Good professor.", "Professor Knudsen is one of the most experienced and brilliant faculty in the IU Geography Department (perhaps in the entire university). His research spans many many sub-fields of the discipline. He teaches courses on food geography and theory. However, the courses I took with him involved industrial and economic geography. He is versatile!", "Professor Riegle is a really great professor-he explains everything clearly and sometimes he can be even funny.I can't understand why those people wrote such negative evaluations.If you stick to the information required in the study guide and do all of the study questions, you will do fine.", "He doesn't teach you besides his own theoretical/proof crap that doesn't make any sense. You must learn on your own with the textbook but must follow his own way of teaching. He doesn't help you at all in the lab and claims that he has no office hours. His questions are similar to the textbook on the midterm but the final is a diff case. Final say:", "Definitely a freshman level class.... Talks about beginner level discussions... Boring.", "Very knowledgable and caring.", "Comes off as an ancharcist hippie", "great teacher ...explains as much as he can..and helps a lot ..he knows his stuff and doesnt refer to his notes every two sec like giarikos..great sense of humor ..always there to help you ..make chem worth siting through ..for chem 1 i revolved my schedule aorund this mans class...i been with him 3 semesters and have great chem grades till now.:)", "Really passionate and his enthusiasm is contagious. Has a tendency to go off on tangents, and on tangents of tangents, but always gives the class an offbeat, positive atmosphere. I may have more of his personal quotes written down than actual notes, but his teaching style is so engaging that abstract concepts become much easier to grasp.", "Avoid at ALL COSTS!!!! He is a very rude and boring old man. His test has nothing to do with the material. 55 minute lectures feel like 55 days. Honestly if his class is the only class that makes you a full time student it'll be better to stay part time.", "he is a really cool professor! I am taking him again. The class is very laid back but it seems like you are not even finished writing one paper and he is assigning the next. Its not bad at all though. I would recomend him.", "Wessel really knows his stuff. He teaches at other campuses as well, so he seems to have experience. Very funny guy, really gets you excited. Great direction. If you need a little bit more help he is willing and able. Materials for this class were over $100 easy which may be high. I'm not sure as this is my first art class. But they were all needed", "Is the worst professor ever at wsu he should be fire!", "Took him a couple of years ago when I was doing my MBA for Strategy of the Firm or something like that. Great teacher; class was really enjoyable; especially the mock business and the different teams that we were divided into. Earned an \"A\" and received an e-mail from him afterwards thanking me for my participation and work in the class.", "Great Chef and great teacher. Loved my two years here at fanshawe.", "Great class. Do the work and put the time effort into the workshop and that's all he can ask of you. Besides this class he has been super helpful in getting my portfolio together and academic advising. Great teacher, great guy.", "I loved Brother Zenger. He was so nice and willing to help and made class interesting. Just do the homework and come to class and study for the tests which were difficult, but as long as you study, its pretty easy. Loved the study guides and reviews in class.", "No Comments", "Dr. R is an absolutely ridiculous teacher. I thought that I was actually going to learn something different by having this major and I haven't. You basically get a management degree and take 2 extra classes where you read some articles about Music, Sports, Event and Venue Management. All the other classes are electives and have nothing to do with E", "great teacher, going to his office hours is very helpful because he is willing to go over and workout any problem you ask him too. lots of homework but it prepares you for the test. pretty funny. tests are based on the homework, very fair grader. . don't skip class. this class will not be an easy A. study and do your work and you will get an A.", "His lectures usually have nothing to do with the lesson nor do they relate to the textbook Tests are all or nothing, meaning you either get 25 points in a question or 0 points. One little mistake in code and you lose all points (I wish I was exaggerating). Your best bet is to hope his old tests make sense.", "Dr. Fisher taught the first half of the semester of my class, and I really enjoyed taking his class. He explained everything very well and always made sure to answer questions sufficiently. The best part of his class is his great sense of humor that makes each class interesting without taking academic value away from the class.", "Don't expect a bird course from him. Pay attention when he says something will be on the test, write down everything that sounds like a key term, and take an interest in the course; he'll notice and go above and beyond for you. He's short with people who deserve it. Don't be a lazy student in his class, ESPECIALLY Introductory Japanese.", "Advanced FInancial Management. His class is hard. He is very very smart and curves things, he also doesn't let you sneak out if you dont know something, he will dig it out and then teach you. Take notes and study often, this is not a class you take lightly. You will learn a lot and he lets you do things on your own and doesnt' hold your hand.", "fabulous teacher", "Kraay is an AMAZING lecturer, PHL110 was a really interesting course, I actually learned something from him. However, you really cannot skip class (he doesn't post full PPTs) and he is a very tough grader. Even with my interest in the course, I found it really hard to balance such a demanding elective.", "He is a solid, grounded and very practical Prof. He simplifies the content and is quite fair. One does need to put some work into this course.", "Very pompous,concieted and overal I felt like I learned very little from the course.every class he would let students rant on about how each story related to their life-group therapy-esque .gag. I only marginally disliked him until I had medical problems and he accused me of lying to him not being a serious student.seemed like nice guy- but an assh", "He is an awesome prof", "Prof Allen is a nice professor however he expects everyone to be a writer, I didnt like the class at all, and he used to make jokes all the time that were not funny. If you are good at writing take him, if not look for someone else, its no time an easy A", "Great teacher! This was one of the most interesting and fun classes I have taken at MU. He made the already interesting subject of Psychology come alive and stick to your insides. A great man that will always be a part of his students.", "I took this class online. It consisted of weekly forums, a few tests, and one paper. I liked that the forum questions were easy to discuss and based on your own personal opinions/experiences. The tests were timed, so it was necessary to study in advance in order to not run out of time. The class was really easy for me.", "Great teacher. He gives outlines with every chapter, and review questions before the tests. He presents his information on power point, making the lectures easy to follow. Study hard, and you'll do great!", "This is the best teacher I have ever had. He really knows his stuff and works on your writing as hard as his own. I recommend him for only those courageous enough to work and hear the truth about their work. This guy really refines your stuff! Take often!", "Professor Karpinksi is AWESOME! Most amazing person i have ever met. There are two reflection papers one page each, and three 5 papers. He does an amazing job at explaining the material! He give you extra time to complete the papers. TAKE HIM! Best religion teacher EVER! Keep up the great work Professor! Chili pepper approved!", "He was great! He does expect a lot. You have to read and take a lot of notes, but he does keep it interesting.", "He is a great teacher! Cool thing was is he has actually been out in the feild before teaching! You will learn a lot if you come with the right attitude! I am not interested in Astronomy but he is, so it makes it more interesting. Don't take him if you fall asleep easy! I like his class, but go to class, and he like people who ask questions.", "He's honestly the best teacher out there. I am so glad I took him. His grading is pretty easy as well. He does try to help his students out by giving a practice test before the actual test. Hes a very understanding and wonderful teacher.", "Critelli is hilarious. His lectures are confusing, but that's because of the subject matter, not him. He wants everyone to get an A and does his best to clarify the material, no matter how many times you need him to go over it. Take this class!", "Very good teacher,makes class interesting.", "He goes way too fast in class and is pretty unclear. I think he has just been teaching for too long and has forgotten how to teach and that we don't all know everything already.", "Prof Colasurdo is an awesome professor. I just loved his class. He is a great teacher and he is definitely not boring, has a great sense of humor.", "****...dumb but thinks he is smart...doesn't really know what he believes in?!?!?!", "This professor is hands down terrible. He is condescending, critical, and extremely rude to your face. His grading is unfair and harsh, and he offers no help or extra assistance that is of any use. DO NOT take this class.", "An outstanding veteran of college professors, Professor Critelli's Philo 2 class was very thought-provoking as well as interesting even when I had little to no interest in the subject prior to signing up. The reading is supplementary, as noted, so take thorough notes when you take his class", "Had him for invertebrate zoology and parasitology, but sadly not entemology. Very tough, definitely. Yet, you learned a lot and will definitely never forget his classes. Tests were difficult, but fair. Too bad he retired. I'll miss his quirkiness (\"Doo da...da da dee doo dum\"-->anyone who had him understands) and enthusiasm. Thanks Dr. Alsop!", "No Comments", "i dont understand him nor do i understand his accent... did not enjoy the winter and missed hall like crazy...", "One of the best math professors there are .", "Good science course for non-science majors. Just follow the syllabus.", "He is such a great teacher and loves what he does. Simply print out the guidelines and write simple notes in the margin and study it, you have at least a B in the class. He is such a nice guy and makes a lot of jokes. I would recommend him to anyone. Oh, and he drops one test grade if you take all 5.", "I took the Shakespeare UW with this prof, and he's a little harsh. He teaches you what you need to know, and I loved watching the movies. He grades really strictly. Make sure you develop all arguments. PARTICIPATE IN CLASS!!!!", "He is very good. This was my first electronics course and he made the material very clear and easy to understand and the material itself is not easy at all but he manage to make it understanable. Just don't wait until the end to do the HW or you are going to be sorry. Take very good notes and ask?.", "Porof.Berg is a great guy, he makes the course interesting and fun, also he is clear with the material and makes it easy to understand, however, his test are a bit on the hard side, you must know the material inside out.", "He was a very kind and understanding. He wasn't judgmental and was reasonable. I'd recommend him.", "Dr. Lissemore knows his genetics, and his history. The class is very difficult and requires patience to understand and comprehend- but worthwhile learned a lot in a short time! BTW this material is on the MCAT and if you want to take that you need this class, and he will definately prep you for that", "Best instructor I have ever had the privilege to sit in a classroom with. I leave the country for the next three years and one of the things im doing my last two days in America is sitting in on his class. Take him if you can.", "He is awesome, strict but if you do the work you will get the grade. He is very helpful pay attention to the powerpoints and notes, know the material backwards and foreward for your own benefit.", "He made promises he did not keep during the first week of class. By the time we got wise to him it was to late to drop the class.", "I dont understand why he is useless. David Martin has specific teaching experience. There are times the class is tough to understand. But he makes you work for it. Giving you quizzes every week in class isn't a big deal it wakes you up. He gives lab homework and his grades assignments hes not like other teachers that dont grade hw.", "Best class I've ever taken", "No Comments", "Hannon is a great guy. He really cares about his students. The class, however, is a wreck. I took baby physics in HS and thought I could handle it. WRONG. This class covers all sorts of math it shouldn't - like vector and diffe. yikes.", "prof. make class seem hard then it is to scare u. if u study the slides the nite before and spoke out during discussion u'll do fine. 2 tests and a group project which my group did the day before ... lecture is slow and dry but i got good news (no not Geico) u have a computer so surf the web all u want. but just check back in every once in a while", "His grading is based on attendance, 1 oral presentation, 1 midterm with essay, and 1 final w/essay. Essay prompts are given 1 week in advance to prepare for. The oral presentation is based on a single question off of the reading, its really easy.", "No Comments", "Overall he's an average professor. Gives good explanations. Requires a lot of textbook reading because his lectures are very vague. Tests are pretty tough but if you read the textbook you will pass.", "He was such a great teacher! So understanding and very helpful! I learned so much from him!!! TAKE HIM!!!", "Phenomenal instructor. He KNOWS contracts, and he KNOWS the UCC. He doesn't just teach theory. He teaches the class in a practical, realistic way, and he forces us to think the same way. He's done more than most profs to show me how the law and lawyers work in the real world.", "No Comments", "like sitting in on family vacation slides, but his vacations insted of relatives", "does not tell you but takes marks off for wrong answers. Better to not answer than attempt. Going in for extra help will not help you, sucking up and whining will.", "This class will stand out as one of the best you will take. Paciocco has a phenomenal understanding of the material and is one of Canada's leading experts. He is also an equally brilliant orator/lecturer. The materials and exams are challenging, but absolutely worth it. Do whatever you can to take his classes.", "I like this professor", "I took the class because I thought it sounded interesting. He's a really nice guy, but grades kinda harshly. You are allowed to miss 3 classes, but after that it hurts your final grade. There are 3 papers: 2 are 6-7 pages, 1 is 11-12. You will definitely be able to better analyze both literature and film after this class. He's a great teacher!!!", "Biggest waste of time and money. His exams are a joke and is more interested in entertaining than actually teaching.", "Overall his class was not hard, but it definitely can't be taken lightly. He tells you ahead of time what the question are for the final so preparing is all up to you. The quizzes are from the book so reading is mandatory. He likes to reward those that attend class with extra credit points or a sneak peek of quiz. No reason not to take his class.", "Barry Cohen is one of the best computer science professors in NJIT. His use of class time is remarkable (except for the times when he goes off into tangents). He is very knowledgeable about the material, and his use of classroom assistants is definitely made to help students. I would highly recommend him.", "This guy talks too fast, his lecture notes are horrendously, and the class is very poorly organized. He really should go back to that community college he's really from.", "Lectures are long and boring. Class is easy if you are good with technology (word and excel). Definitely makes you work for your grade!", "I regretted taken class with him. He is just horrible. It is very hard to apply what he taught in class on exams. He's not a fair grader. Coming to his class does not worth with bcos you can not apply what he teaches in class on exams and home work. I will never advise anyone to take his class. He will mess up your gpa. His labs grading are worst.", "Very entertaining prof. He is willing to help. Very nice and laid back, however he has no grading rubric and is not easy. But it was a relaxing class with not much reading and only 3 papers.", "People make Peter Bloom sound like the most inhumane pompous person ever to inhabit the planet. But he's really an excellent professor. I have learned more from his classes than any other classes I've taken here. Even his tangents are informative. Take his seminars, they're worth it.", "He really knows what he is talking about but, his lessons are more than boring, his review is going back through the slides we've already seen, and there isn't any new information he gives you in review. His tests are extremely hard and specific. Great man. Terrible professor.", "Ha! Ha! The class is easy! He doesn't even talk to you every day. It doesn't matter who you take. But your heart rate does go by 6's! Show up and fill your log sheet!", "No he doesn't responed to emails but he is a pretty cool guy and a good teacher", "No Comments", "This was my second class with Prof. Cooke and I can't say he was much more organized than the first time. Prof. Cooke means well and is a nice guy, but he just seems all over the place and not clear on his assignment requirements.", "Ok if you take him for the 400 level class it's not as easy as everyone says. He requires a 24 page paper, short assignments, final, midterm, presentation etc so if you do take his class be prepared to come with the mindset to do work. Senioritis is not allowed overall he explains well and if you do your work you will be fine.", "Very good sense of humour. Teaching methods did not work well for me, minimal interaction with students. Several of my friends did very well though and enjoyed his lectures. Would prefer a tutorial rather than an extra 30 mins of classtime. Fair tests, but the exam was written by another professor, and was not very related to what what we learned.", "I liked him, thought he was an excellent teacher. At first I found him slightly unapproachable, but after I had to go to him for help he was great and helped me out. Just don't get behind in class.", "Wow! This guy is a genious! For real though...check out his work or google him...he really knows what he teaches but yeah he's a great teacher! A lot of learning going on and he gives great ideas and tips...take him!", "The class is fun...but lately he has decided to give a final. Pay attention because this is VERY important. The final is SERIOUS. Read the book. Or at least the chapters that he tells you to. If you want a good grade you need to do well on the final. I was running an A- in teh class and after the final ended witha B+.", "Very bright guy. Fun to talk to. Very liberal, but fair.", "Dr. K is a great professor. If you have the opportunity you should take him. Keeps the class engaged and respects all of his students. He teaches you life lessons I don't think you'll find in any other class at DePaul.", "boring, not inspiring, and doesn't teach. he just babbles all class, and all the learning is you reading the textbook. quizzes and tests have nothing to do with any material learned in class.", "This guy knows how to teach. He's so busy as chair of the department but he'll make time for you and he's amazing one on one. If you don't like paper tests, he'll let you do an oral test and he really works with your needs. Fantastic. Please take a class with him. He's a genius!", "A lot harder than i thought it would be!", "THE WORST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD.I WENT INTO HIS CLASS EXPECTING A LOT BECAUSE OTHER STUDENTS RAVED ABOUT HIM.

Encourages participation and makes everyone feel included!", "Took his class online very easy stay on top of the syllabus it tells you ahead what the work is only missed one discussion board but did well on everything else be sure to cite answers from the book and paper 5-7 pages cite from things you covered in the book easy A very clear on what he wants put in effort even half way you'll pass trust", "Class was good and if I studied more, would have done better. Very nice teacher who really cares. Kinda hot too with a great personality. Show up each class and you will do well. Yeah the book is boring but thats prob why he lectures like he does. He makes it interesting.", "Camilo is literally by far the best professor I have ever had at Dutchess. He's everything you'd want in a professor if you are interested in the subject and willing to work hard every day. He is hilarious, witty, and always willing to help with whatever. He really strives for your absolute best and does not accept any BS.", "thinks hes better than he is.", "No Comments", "Wonderful teacher!! He is kind and knows his stuff. Take him if you can!", "He is a GREAT instructor. I suck at the class though and it is mad hard and sometimes makes me want to kill myself, and everytime there is a test I get sick, I think it is because of the ulcer I got from being stressed, but I am getting through it and getting the extra help I need.", "Awesome professor, Good Sense of Humour, Just a nice guy in general!", "Prof Hirschl is awful. DSOC 1101 is awful. If you do the work, you will get a good grade, but the amount of work is obscene for such a stupid class. Hirschl tests you on his own material and his own views. I didnt know what sociology was until I looked it up three weeks into class. He makes you buy books for two chapters. AVOID if you enjoy sanit y", "A brilliant Constitutional scholar that is not afraid to tackle the sensitive constitutional issues that confront our nation. He is very clear about is stance on the issues the Court, but he does not attempt to get you to adopt his views. He teaches the class in a fair, objective, and balanced manner. And he will go out of his way to help students.", "Such a dynamic teacher. You can really tell he's interested in what he's teaching. Very knowledgeable, and uses good examples to clarify. Talks at a relatively normal speed, not slowed down like many other professors. Very upfront about how this class will be challenging. Keeps class interesting with his enthusiasm. Keeps the class engaged.", "Organized lectures, great prof, cares about students, best in A&M Commerce, don't complain, takes time with students", "Katz is one of the best professors I've ever had. Incredibly helpful and nice, both personally and educationally. Very very funny and presents material in an interesting way. VERY hard grader.", "Probably the best professor at Queen's Law. Friendly, engaging, and knows the material cold. His evaluations are challenging but fair. Plus, the dude is jacked. Highly recommended.", "not only is Dr. Jones super cute he's also a really good teacher. He made me look at the things i did on a regular basis in a completely different light. Everyone should take him.", "Apparently for a beginning classical guitar class you must have been playing and know to read music. I took it for winter intersession for an intro guitar course but from day one he already has the intention of weeding out those who can't play. I'd suggest avoiding him if you're trying to learn it for fun.", "Favorite Class and Favorite Prof. Most useful class I've EVER taken. FUNNY", "his voice puts me to sleep, and when i am discussing his points with fellow classmates, someone always shushes me because o'brian is talking about a quotation taken from a book talking about a reviewer of the director of the movie were watching....hes a dud, and he cancelled blade runner :(", "You can't not love this guy- loves teaching and is always willing to help you, has an old-man-endearing and innocent nature to him. always means well and works hard for his students. His class is interesting and not too challenging. I took world regional geography with him and enjoyed it.", "Very likely the hardest working and most dedicated instructor that I have seen in a while. Will push students to do their very best and works hard to make sure students have a good learning environment. Be warned, he is tough and will not take any BS. Come on time, come prepared, and work hard for your grade!", "He gave clear instructions, but his grading criteria was not as concise. Good marks for actual classroom instruction, poor marks for time management and sensitive/specific grading.", "very laid-back,friendly,and approachable.he really likes it when you participate in class discussions.can be confusing when giving instructions for assignments.assignments really make you think but doable.not a hard grader but read the assigned readings because he does ask questions", "Anyone who says Dr. Baer isn't an awesome prrof obviously didn't care enough to study hard. Dr. Baer is probably the est education professor at Rider. I wish he taught more classes because I would love to take him again.", "He is really nice prof. He is really helpful all the time. He is cool!", "Insulting and condescending. Still got a B+ in his class.", "This professor is great. this class only involves teaching the class for a day and writing two papers. Very easy and fun, just watching him teach makes you smile. You will have a blast", "This class was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Terry likes to offend his students and throw temper-tantrums. Maybe for art students his class might be more enjoyable; he certainly is passionate about what he is teaching. However, he likes to act like an english professor. Be expected to take just as many english quizzes as art quizzes", "This man was TERRIBLE. Why is he teaching? He knows lots, sure, but so BORING and no direction to his students at all. It was like he was trying to get us to fail!!", "He makes you feel at ease and his grading method is clear and precise. He is also very approachable. I highly recommend him if you have never taken speech and super nervous about it.", "Before you take any of his classe you should have a masters in English. He cares more about your grammar than your content. He doesn't make very clear points, and he tests on things that he doesn't teach, and arent in the books. Nice man but perhaps not the best teacher.", "This was possibly the best possible intro to Philosophy class I could have taken. The material was presented in a way that made it easy to apply the concepts to real life. Panos really makes the material come alive, and if you open your mind at all, you will do great, and leave with at least a new perspective on life. DO THE READING!!!", "This guy should be in research for a wal-mart stores.Very hard ,and worthles lecture spent on graphing ,graohing,and graphing .", "Worst professor I've ever had. Ridiculous amount of expected reading, unclear directions for every assignment and very harsh grading. He's a nice guy, but he does meet you at your level. He acts as if everyone has read the texts as much as he has. He just read off a piece of paper and didn't care if you were learning or not. I learned nothing.", "HE IS AMAZING!!!! One of the best classes ever!", "all you got to do is read", "Very droning, literally reading straight from a piece of paper, a lot of interesting things have happened in history and he touches on none of them.", "Lectures were interesting and informative. Normally wasn't much of a rock/earth person but found myself looking forward to class each day. Labs are AWESOME. Using tools real geologists do, and learning things that are relevant in many other fields. Overall a great guy and always willing to work with students individually to ensure learning.", "One of the worse professors I've ever had. Just a short man with a personality to match. God help anyone who has him as a teacher or therapist.", "This teacher was excellent! He was always ready for questions on the homework, and even encouraged them. He helped to the best of his ability, and truly cared for the knowledge that he gave his students. I hated math from previous teachers, but I liked it in his class. Anyone wanting to take Calculus should definitely consider taken Dr. Kern.", "ok I don't know what anyone is talking about, this class is so boring and tedious, it's insane how much notes are given each and every class and how every single part of it is on the test, the test are really hard, and need a lot of memorizing, but there is a pretty big curve, but wayyyy too much notes every dayyy, cannot miss anythingg!", "Professor Burge is one of the nicest and most interesting teachers that I've had so far at Towson. He is extremely interesting and his class is a piece of cake. You do have to study for his tests and memorize quite a bit for the essays, but other than that it's worth taking his class. If I had the chance I would take another one of his classes!", "I really enjoyed his class. Great guy. He was fun and interesting to listen to. Some of the points he makes really make you think.", "Professor Sharif is unintelligible. His accent is atrocious, and he speaks as though he has a mouth full of marbles, and his handwriting is somehow worse. He writes both his \"v's and r's\" as you would a gamma, which come up a lot in dynamics. He isn't capable of doing his own problems in class, and made the 2nd test the day after the drop date.", "The best out of the three profs for the class. He had a very good powerpoint w/ actual words not just pictures. And he would explain each point. Very helpful prof. love his lectures.", "Dr. Fields is the man. Come to class and participate and you will do fine. I recommend this teacher to anyone beginning the Criminal Justice program.", "He rambles endlessly and gives lectures from memory. He isn't well prepared for every class although he obviously knowns what he is talking about it comes across disjointed and is impossible to take notes from. Just drill the book and teach your self. Supplements save lives.", "Hilarious guy!!!! Must take! This is a GPA booster. I had him as an online class and I was cracking up while reading the study guide! Take him!!", "Todd's really fun in class and defintiely into what he's teaching. Be ready for him to get really side tracked and share quite a bit about his personal life. It's almost always hilarious though. He really cares about what he teaches and when he assigns readings, you really do need to do them. If not, you can get by but it'll be difficult.", "I really hate his teaching style... he goes on and on and doesn't explain things well. Plus he wrote his own textbook... and you must read it because he's not great at teaching... retire already..", "Dr. Allard is very funny and very engaging! Even as a hard marker, he cares about his students and is very helpful. Everything you would want in a professor is in Dr. Allard. He is not only good at teaching, but also good at communicating what he wants from students. His marking is difficult, but very challenging and helps students learn and grow.", "Amazing professor", "It doesn't get any better than Fred. He's brilliant, hilarious, and can keep a lecture hall thoroughly stimulaeted.

He always includes the students and ask if we need more help. Go to class take very good notes and theres the test straight from lecture, but the lectures are not boring. No need to buy the book.

Doesn't care about his students in the slightest since he's a \"research professor\", will nickel and dime you on every test so much so that all semester I never received full credit on a single question, changes study guide questions to be nothing like test questions.

He got off topic easily. We used three books that seem to be above what students can comprehend. Students really have to think to connect what the books are saying to web design. Hated the Tufte book. Exams are pretty easy if you have the slightest idea what you're talking about.", "You can tell he is passionate about teaching and his lectures are highly educational. He throws in funny remarks during his lectures to keep class interesting. Use his homework as a way to keep track of what to study. He also gives out old tests with answer keys before each exam.", "I thought, based on our homework, that the tests were going to be really hard. They weren't. At all. Even though I had to drop the class (too many other classes) I've stayed to take notes and learn the material. He's even given me copies of tests that he's given this semester. Over all, good teacher. 2nd best math teacher I've ever had.", "I loved taking this class. He takes a different approach to teaching history, and further wants you to understand it instead of just reading out of a book. He's very helpful, all you have to do is ask, and cares about his students. I'd love to take another class with him.", "One of the worst professors I have ever encountered. Stay as far away as possible.?", "No Comments", "Great proffessor and treats all students the same", "Grades harshly and not clear on all assignments.

Oh, and DO NOT tell him your an athlete, you're guaranteeing a low grade from the start.", "I LOVED Hal Blythe!! Wonderful professor!", "This class is not for beginners or for those of you returning to school.You need to have a very good understanding of Algebra to take his classes.

This class is a must take for biology majors", "Great teacher for new testament but its not easy to make an A!", "Can barely speak English. Doesn't know anything about course material. Gives no page references to decode his impossible lectures. He once said, and I quote... \"Mandarins can't be lazy, like Mexicans who sleep under trees all day\". But it's not worth the agony and confusion. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS.", "Ok guy and an ok professor. The class is great and since he is the only one that teaches it you really have no choice. He knows what he's talking about and he tries to make it interesting. If you get into it, the class can be fun. It's easy no matter what.", "By far my favorite professor at MSU!!

If you pay attention in class, the tests are simple. Definitely take him !:)", "Didn't give the course packet to us at all, so it was very difficult.

He was one of the best prof's I have ever had!", "Totally awesome, everyone's right about his lectures, they get off topic easily...so you have to take whatever you want from his teachings", "Dr. G is the man! I took this course online over J-term, but he was still very helpful. Read the instructions and do exactly what he is asking for, and it is an easy A.", "Go to class and read the assigned material and you shouldn't have any problem with your grades in the class. Although he tends to go off into tangents about weird things sometimes so his lectures aren't always the most interesting.", "I had a lot of trouble learning the material in the class b/c I had to teach myself. That's just not the kind of professor I like. His tests are pretty hard too- but if you never go to class,read the book,understand completely, and do well on the test...go for it, he's your guy.", "Funny guy, tries to make class enjoyable but really his exam questions are much more tricky than one would anticipate just from going to lectures. He's pretty good at explaining things though, and uses iclicker questions similiar in format (not difficulty-wise) to those found on exams", "Although he is a hard grader, Katz is very personable and enthusiastic--it has been a pleasure to have him as a teacher. Would highly recommend.", "Simple and easy to follow class. There are not a lot of things graded, just 2 group projects and two tests so it was quite easy to keep up with. The only mandatory attendance is when the group projects are presented.", "Not too shabby, enjoyed him", "Very inconsistent and unclear. Adds unnecessary things that trip you up.

Do not take him for intro to physics.", "Professor Warwick is the best. I took his online course plus the lab and I actually learned a lot.

Still, he's smart and a", "this dude is a joke", "Dr. Kent is very smart and he makes that very obvious. His tests consists of a lot of critical thinking but he certainly gives you the tools to succeed.

Do or do not, there is no try! you have to put forth the effort.", "This professor is TOUGH. This is no easy ride and you should be thankful for that. You go to school to LEARN and not to just receive a degree. We pay more for our degrees than Rutgers students so we should expect to work for it. You work for it in this class. Love this professor.", "Arrogant arrogant arrogant! This man is possibly the most arrogant assh--- I've ever met in my entire life and has zero people skills and basically doesn't admit when he makes a mistake. Absolutely no help, arrives late to class, yet has expectations that you are on time and professional when he clearly is not. He should be fired immediately.", "Took him for HU221 and EN536 American Poetry. Hands down my favorite English Professor at BU. Basically a genius and such a kind, humble, and funny person. Take his courses if you love to close read. He really gives you the freedom to offer interesting, off-the-wall readings. Basically, can't say enough. Take his classes.", "He is great and interesting. Study everything in the notes and you will be fine. Do the old practice exams that he gives because they are really helpful. He gives so much bonus points that both semester I had averages over 100.", "This class is fairly easy. Make sure you come to every class and pay attention.

He's also pretty funny.", "I left DCC last semester, moved on to a more acclaimed school, met new people, new professors, and Camilo is still the best Professor/person I have ever met.

Hilarious, but 75% of your grade is based on in class quizzes. But if you do the reading you will be fine.", "He's a nice guy. The class was very boring and made sure to keep us to the last second. He does a review the class before each test. Just take notes that class and study them and you'll do fine on the tests.", "Excellent history prof, I highly recommend his courses.", "He is intimdating. His whole point is to get people who are not serious about the class out of it. He will have pop quizzes when students start leaving during half time, so I encourage you to stay. He gives a study guide for all his test, and allows notecards for test eventually, which help greatly! DO the study giudes and you will do fine.", "hard to get used to... but knows his stuff and will help you more than any other skiddie art prof", "Cool guy, easy class but you learn a lot. Loved it.", "Mr. Coleman has a wonderful personality, and if I were a paleontologist listining to his sermons, I would probably understand his class. He doesn't teach on a student's level. He should be teaching a Harvard level Geology course.", "His favotite subject: Robert Ware....RUDE and cancels class without much warning. Very unprofessional. Doesn't reply to emails.", "Probably the greatest teacher I have ever had. Taking his class actually changed my outlook on religion and life. You must go to class and listen!! He is an amazing lecturer and is extremely knowledgable. He makes all his philosophical points easy to understand, often using his cats as examples, haha, or ice cream. Highly recommended. Amazing Prof.", "Amazing teacher! Easy class, does attendance every class, and doesn't believe in teaching on Fridays. There are two paragraph papers due every Wednesday over interesting topics.

Trust me, no matter what your major is you will NOT regret taking one of his classes.", "inspirational teacher. very fair marker, makes class fun and interesting :)", "Don't do it unless you are familiar with Mac 1105. I'm a straight A student & had a difficult time. Test seem to have nothing to do with what you've studied.

If you're not somewhat familiar with Mac 1105, DON'T DO IT, YOU'LL REGRET IT.", "Expect to do A LOT of work. Some of his assignments are pointless. They can also be difficult and time consuming, but he's an easy grader. The class is pretty boring.", "Holy Cow! This class was insane. But I recommend Godel, Escher, Bach Frontiers because it's an incredibly interesting class -- probably only because Mr. McKibben teaches it. Works really hard to help us understand everything. Great comments -- makes you want to do well in his class.", "This class was useless but I took it for the easy A. Literally rarely came to class but came to all of the sections and did the readings. Take it for the diversity distribution requirement. You won't regret it.", "He straight gives you the answers to the test, so if you listen you'll get a 100. You have easy papers every week.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. THIS PROFESSOR GIVES 3 EXAMS WHICH ARE MULTIPLE CHOICE BUT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. EXTREMELY. IT GETS BETTER THOUGH... THE FINAL IS 100 MULTIPLE QUESTIONS WHICH IS CUMULATIVE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER. SAVE YOUR GPA, TAKE THIS WITH SOMEONE ELSE", "Never EVER have I met a more CONDESCENDING and RUDE teacher in my life. If you don't have thick skin, you can pretty much expect to leave in tears after every class. Claims he wants you to succeed but then tells students they won't make a good \"such and such\" if they can't do this/can't do that. Word cannot describe how AWFUL he talks to students.", "Prof. T is one of the best profs I've ever had. His reviews are helpful, he has a good sense of humor and he keeps the lectures interesting.

He is a real teacher that expects you to learn!", "Prof. Green has a lot of information to share. You have to be self motivated in his class because he is very laid back but grades hard. Still I think he is a good professor for those interested in the field. I am definitely taking other classes he offers.", "He is an excellent professor. He knows the material he is teaching. I enjoyed his class because he tried to connect the past and the current events. He does his best to make the class interesting and also is very kind and tries always to help his students.

To my surprise, It was not that bad. He is by far the BEST professsor I ever had at John Jay. He makes you work, and read ALOT!!!

He teaches straight foward, and explains student", "Very straightfoward with material, you know exactly what will be on an exam. Knows a lot about Spain from experience.

Study guides exactly what will be on exams. Just pay attention.", "Tests and bell ringers are VERY HARD. You really need to study. His lectures are interesting to say the least. His sex lecture if by far the best/funniest lecture I've ever been to in my 3 years at BU!", "An excellent person, who is down-to-earth and really knows his stuff.

RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN!!!", "good", "class is not an easy A but its not horrible. theres weekly papers, two tests and a final exam. the tests consist of 25 MC and 1 essay. he hands out potential essay questions a week in advance. MC choice questions are difficult but writing a decent essay is enough to make up for that. overall, he is a really nice prof even though the class is hard", "At first I though this course was some sort of joke and this was what sociology was all about.

The project is massive, but if you're interested in computer science and programming, it should be fun. Don't procrastinate!", "Very nice guy, pretty funny as well. Great to talk to about grad schools and the like if that's what you need. Yes he makes you memorize the amino acids, but get over it. The class is interesting, and I'd still say it's more conceptually based than memorization based. Especially compared to evil bios 302. Tests are challenging, but it was nice to actually be challenged on a test and get a chance to show what I learned.", "One of the worst at JMSB Finance. Avoid at all costs. Random grading criteria (basically gives you a good grade if he knows you). If you insist on taking a class with him, focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get assignments/projects/exams right.", "Macko is an awesome teacher.", "At times he can a bit too silly and forget that he's actually trying to prepare you for his tests.", "SOOOOOO FUNNY!!! He just wants to have fun and have a lot of debates with him... oh god! haha.. he is the coolest teacher ever i had!", "You will not regret taking a class with him. I have always struggled with math and thought calc would be impossible for me, but he made it understandable.

Great teacher, I learned so much from him.", "Dr. Wilson is a great teacher who really cares about his students. Yes, he does have a very unique and unorthodox teaching style.

His tests are so confusing, but go to his office hours and he'll help you understand them.", "Yes! Very boring...", "You don't need to attend his lectures, but if you have time, you should check it out, but if you don't, read from the book and you should be fine.

I really did not like him as a teacher. Maybe it was just the online aspect.", "This professor is no joke, ridiculously tough. Although a nice guys and tries to lighten up the mood in class. His tests are extremely hard because they're on a powerpoint and you have a minute to answer. Better off reading the textbook than his slides. Gave a very small curve. I studied hard and got a C. Nobody in that class got higher than a B.", "In my experience, Dr. Bender was not willing to help out, and when he did try to help me was extremely unclear on every answer he gave me. I've never disliked a professor as much as I dislike him.", "In a word: YAY!", "I had this course a while ago, He is a great guy but expect to work a a lot...I had a little bit of programming experience before and still had some difficulty.

TAKE HIS TIME TO EXPLAIN THE COURSE. REALLY DOWN TO EARTH. WISH I COULD TAKE HIM AGAIN. PASS WITH AN A+.", "Exams are based on things discussed in lecture so you need to go to class. Papers are graded exceptionally tough, he doesn't bell curve but the average always tended around a C. Even if you make the improvements based on his comments, it won't mean you'll get a better grade because of how subjectively he marks.", "Avdulov is one of the most caring profs at SMU.

His grading scheme is vague. Thought I failed until I saw my grade. VERY stressful!!", "He does expect you to work. If social psych is your thing he is your proff.

He is a prof that truly has the best interest of his students in mind. His class was always interesting and insightful.", "Too much busy work plus a non-fun 7 page paper. Glad to be done.", "Dr. Pecorino is honestly a great professor. His lectures are somewhat boring, but it's economics. The grading system is incredibly fair and Dr. Pecorino offers VERY generous extra credit. If you show up to every class he will give you 4 points on your final grade. You can get an easy A by just showing up to class and studying for exams.", "he's hard and goes very fast be prepared.

Pay close attention and either take notes or find some one else who takes them and make copies. do pract. exams!!", "Dr. Winters is a great professor! He will spend a significant amount of time helping you if you need it.

His method of teaching is really helpful, in and outside of the classroom.", "Passive aggressive. Doesn't treat students with respect and is more of a dictator instead of a mentor.", "If you enjoy history Professor Reed is probably the best you can get.

He rocks!", "While Devine is indeed engaging and knowledgeable, he also plays blatant favorites, and strives to have students like him [and want in his trousers]. He dumbs down material to appeal to everyone, to the point where bad students are glorified and good students learn nothing. Also vaguley sadistic.", "Elements with WidenI'm sorry this happened to you. DO the reading. Take notes of HOW the Justices argue the topics.

Talk to him after EVERY class about class and write down his views.", "He is extremely intelligent and tries to be fun and entertaining with his Mickey games and reviews for tests.

You really learn a lot in his class. you definitely need to work hard for good grades and be sure to study", "Personally loved this class, he's low key funny so it's not that boring. He tells you exactly whats on the test if you go to class. Don't buy or read the textbook buy his little brown book instead.

It's hard to stay awake during the lectures, but take his class for an easy A!", "I agree with the last person. Milner is awesome. He makes the class enjoyable and I got a lot out of discussion. He teaches you exactly what you need to know to be an effective teacher but at the same time makes you learn it on your own. If you hope to be a great teacher take Milner. You will enjoy it!", "Really nice guy and a good teacher. Wish there were few more karthik's in the department.", "Motor Development and Fundies are both really boring! You will read everything you need to know for Motor Development from the book. His Lectures are a waste of time. However, both classes are very easy.", "I love Professor Yager!

It was discussion based and team taught. Dr. Bodek is one of the best teachers at the college. Very nice and very helpful. Really makes you think outside the box, and has really interesting ideas. Very animated and enthusiastic. Highly recommended for any honors class.", "I think Schreiber rocks! He's great, funny, and interesting if you keep up with the subject - read each chapter that is assigned - and show up for lab. He gives test study guides that are multiple choice and gives the answers to them I've passed all his test just by reading and going over the study guide. He's my favorite teacher so far", "Rob is a good teacher. I loved this class because there were very few student and we just talked about multicultural lit and pedagogical standpoints.

As a professor, he is not the best.", "No Comments", "He is a hilarious and pretty sarcastic (in a funny way) professor. Very knowledgeable thus, this has made my lesson very interesting.

He does not give any feedback yet singles students out in the classroom. Doesn't show up to class", "I am glad he was my Capstone professor because I enjoyed his class so much. Most of the class involves group work, so find good partners on the first day. His personality is something you have to be prepared for, as he can be a little abrasive to sensitive people. Sometimes assignment reqs were unclear but he does everything to help you understand.", "I did not know what to expect going into this course however, Mr. Young did an outstanding job utilizing Canvas and MYMathLab to give his students a clear expectation even before stepping into his class.

But he is really helpful and wants to make sure you do well.", "Nice person, but very odd. Knows what he is talkin' about but he is probably the only one. I am not too sure if Dr. Lakey's thoughts \"generalize\" to others' thoughts.", "The class was fairly easy but the tests were very poorly written. It seems to me like he tries to trick you. He required a textbook that was only on amazon and we only ud it twice and there were hardly any questions over the reading in the text book. I felt like he wasn't prepared for class because the class time was not over the prep assignments.", "This was the hardest class that I have ever took in my life. But I put in many all nighters and managed to get an A. Do not take this class with a full schedule. Stay away! The professor is a bit bitter at that. I am happy that it is all over.", "David is a good professor. The best part of his classes are that there is no penalty for turning in late assignments and that attendance is optional, but I would recommend going to his lectures for further information. Lots of readings and essays to write. It was a good class.", "this was the best class in the world, never wanted to go to a lecture so much, hilarious guy but lectures so well you enjoy it and remember everything. TAKE EAST ASIA", "Great teacher and I'd advise taking him! He really helps out and the exams are a piece of cake if you study for them.", "He's awful, impatient and not helpful.", "He is a brilliant teacher. Makes the class really interesting. The tests seemed easy because he tried really hard to make sure everyone was prepared and fully understood the material.", "Makes a difficult subject into something understandable. Always willing to spend time to help those confused.", "Dr. Brown is BRILLIANT! In fact, he's so brilliant I couldn't understand a word he said. He is VERY nice and tries hard to help. I don't think he understands that most aren't on his level. BE RESPECTFUL and by all means, if you're using Hurleys 9th Ed, go the extra mile and purchase Hurleys 4th ed. solutions manual. He is SOOO funny! Have fun!", "Very unfair grader and very aloof, class was a joke but he didn't grade that way. Definitely look for a better professor", "This class was the main stress of the semester I hated it!! He thinks because he knows the subject everyone else does ! He makes you feel so stupid! He doesn't give good instructions! I worked my ass off and stressed more than I should have. Honestly take another professor spare yourself the trouble .", "Tom is the greatest of all time. The number 1 teacher I've ever had. A bit out of the norm but, ask him what the norm is and he'll tell you it's all about the chairness! Truthfully the most inspiring man of my life -Dean (where are you)", "Going to this class is a joke - just stay at home and write articles all the time. Also - you have to write more than what is just on the syllabus b/c that alone won't get you an A. Stewart is a great guy, but you won't learn anything about reporting in the class you just have to write on your own", "He is the nicest old guy he really is--but I got a B- in the class--my lowest grade =( His quizzes are the trickiest things in the WORLD-notes r completely useless-he expects u to MEMORIZE everythinggg in the chapter n will pull out random stuff that you'd never expect to see. The final was unbelievably hard 2. Nice guy but it's up to you honestly.", "Interesting, wants everyone to succeed, nice guy, sort of grandfatherly. Seems to really like students and teaching.", "Amazing professor. Class was interesting and the material is very easy to understand. I took this course as an elective and it was mad easy. The prof's teaching style is good too and I know a lot of people enjoyed him.", "I took him for intro to drama! It was an easy class, he does require you attend his class as well as two of the theatre productions and write a report over them but it wasn't difficult. Sometimes the plays are fun to watch! Overall I think the class was easy!", "Not recommended if you don't want to work very ver hard. Though he's a good teacher, he asks far too much for a lower level class. It's not supposed to be as difficult as it was. There are no reviews for tests and the tests are very very hard. He does curve them, but you shouldn't have to in a class like this. He is fun and does enjoy what he does.", "Prof. Fox is by far the best Spanish teacher I have ever had. He works hard to make us talk in class and engage us in the lesson. He is update to date with technology and uses it well. He really wants us to learn and remember forever rather than just learn to pass the test. A very good teacher.", "great teacher", "No Comments", "Honestly, I just go to class to look at him.", "If you don't care about your voice and are okay with being exploited by your colleges PR department, then this choir is perfect for you! But really ... WAY overhyped. The straight-tone, blending, and the schedule are antithetical to a healthy singing technique.", "Nice man and really knows his stuff. But if you're looking to take an easy class that sounds interesting, find a different one. He's too smart to teach this gen-ed class.", "Pompous, arrogant, disorganized. His disorganization may work out in your favor...only one test, then a presentation for final. Much busy work. Does not care for opinions other than his own, although he asks for participation. Avoid!", "avoid at all costs...", "No Comments", "Mr. McGee is so straightforward. He gives you all the notes beforehand. You barely have to write anything down. I never went, but studied for every test and I got an A in the class. The book project is kind of tedious, but not bad once you consider. A great professor, but whatever you do don't take this class at 8 a.m.--you will fall asleep/not go.", "Awesome, baby!", "I had him for Business of Media. I learned a lot in the class, but he didn't really teach, everything was mostly self-taught (due to the weekly blog posts). He was interesting and had cool speakers and the workload was pretty heavy (a lot of writing), but I do see the advantages of taking this class as it is very applicable to the real world.", "I don't know how anyone could say he is good. He started with Chapter 9 of the book which is crazy. His test are ridiculously hard even with open book and the study sheet. I had to withdraw from the class and get a W because if not I would've ended with a D. No way!I got an A in statistics but I'm failing beginner math... SILLY!", "very approachable and willing to help", "From what should be the most boring class (SAD), doing flow charts and drawings Dwayne actually manages to keep things interesting. He likes to joke around and pick on people but it's all in good fun. Although he can be tough on you in class at times his class is definitely my favorite.", "Mr. Rooney is a excellent professor, his lectures are long, but crystal clear with the use of humor and enthusiasm which makes the class interesting. His class is composed of written work only, and he is a tough grader. You REALLY need to take notes, study the book, and avoid skipping class in order to pass the class.", "Professor Tarkow makes any topic interesting. I had him for two separate classes, and it was obvious that he really cares about his students and his classes. He can explain any concept and make it easy to understand, but he also pushes you to discover things for yourself. You get out what you put in, so definitely do the required readings.", "GOOD GOOD GOOD JUST STUDY HARDDDD", "Dr. Horn has a very unique teaching style. In short he doesn't really teach. Everything you need to know will come from the textbook, the in-class activities will just confuse you and waste your time. His tests are super vague and hardly reflect what was learned. This class does not prepare you for later chemistry courses. Find another teacher.", "this guy knows so much and he cant wait to tell you about it. hes very enthusiastic and so friendly its impossible not to like him!", "Very very hard grader- you MUST keep up on all of the readings. But he gives excellent lectures and is very willing to help students with the assignments. Very funny- keeps you interested. I'd recommend him despite the really hard work.", "He is a nutcase but he's awesome. His courses are very interesting.", "Please take anyone but him. Have had him for 3 classes and he talks about the same things in all which have nothing to do with psychology! His lectures are pointless. His tests are ridiculously hard because he wants you to know everything like a professional but teaches none of it. Grades are random. Very unprofessional!!", "No Comments", "awful", "No Comments", "This professor is a CHALLENGE. This is no easy ride and you should be thankful for that. You learn how to speak publically and debate. Plus, if you're struggling he gives you a chance to pass. There's a lot of feedback and extra credit so there's nearly no excuse to fail. You work for your grade in this class. I love this professor! He's AWESOME!!!", "I took his American Gov class online during the summer. I read the textbook, took notes, and looked at his supplemental materials. However, for his quizzes it was unclear what to study for. The practices tests were nothing like the actual ones. However he is very easy to get in touch with and responds quickly to e-mails/texts.", "Easy and informative classes, just keep up with the notes. He comes off as extremely pompous. Which he can be, but for the most part he is alright.", "Don't take this Professor if you have learning differences. His learning style doesn't work for someone who has learning issues. Labs vary, quizzes are almost daily, which is fine, but he doesn't explain the material in simple terms. He makes things complicated than they need to be... His voice will make you go to sleep. I love compsci,", "I would take every class Dr. Lombrana had to offer!", "Really nice guy, but the material is boring. His tests are hard, definitely study more than you normally would. He likes detail. Very helpful teacher, though a little forgetful at times. His bowties are cute.", "Absolutely do not take unless you know everything about Trig BEFORE entering this class! Goes over the most basic examples and expects you to automatically know how to do the more advanced problems. When I said I didn't remember anything from College Algebra, his answer was, \"Not my problem.\" AVOID!!!", "This class is more of an informative class for your future in the aerospace program while learning about basic fundamentals. Dr. Baker cares a lot about everyone in the department and tries to assure everyone is set up for success in this class and in their future in the AEM curriculum.", "Great professor and probably one of the most intellegent teachers I've ever met. The test however are extreamly hard and you are expected to remember a lot to pass.", "Chaney is super cool! Took him for intro to screenwriting. He's relatable and understands his students. He's really good with feedback on your scripts. Sometimes he can get distracted easily and it can be annoying but his distractions make class interesting! Would totally take him again!", "Great Professor, great knowledge of subject. Highly recommend this class. Very little use of text- lots of articles to read on line. Can be a little vague as to what he wants from students. Midterm, Final, and Group Project.", "Very cool guy. An adjunct who has a love for astronomy and shares it with the students. Hilarious. Lectures can drag on sometimes but he is very well informed and clear. Takes people out to the observatory to observe the stars. Great guy, great class", "Decent class. Make sure you print out all the notes and write in the margins to study. There are 5 tests and he drops the lowest grade if you take all 5. Kinda funny sometimes. Gives some extra credit.", "Course textbook: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Variable names Ford, Arthur and HHGTG were common. Lots of intel references. On a whole, really liked his teaching style. Wierd, geeky humor.", "great prof, very interesting, cute, just love the accent", "Has a problem accepting other people's ideas. Loves work to be geared toward engineering appearance and simplistic. Hates color and extravagant projects. Then again, he has big expectations for every project and spends hours elaborating on how he wants it done exactly.", "RUN!! I MEAN RUN!!IF YOU WANT TO PASS WITH A DECENT GRADE DO NOT TAKE HIM. I HAVE TAKEN A&P I HAVE A MASSAGE LICENSE AND I AM DROPPING MID SEMESTER. NEARLY MY WHOLE CLASS IS FAILING, IN WHICH HE TAKES NO BLAME. HIS TESTS ARE PERSONALLY MADE AND DON'T MAKE SENSE COMPARED TO THE LECTURE. TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!!", "professor is funny! makes class fun", "Class was kinda tough (higher level engineering math), but he did pretty well teaching it...uses a lot of his own problems for homework, does some things that aren't in the book. Great guy, makes jokes all class; he really gets into what he's teaching, which helps with learning (even if you don't really understand it)", "This guy is amazing, but if you become his friend, his class will become even more amazing and he will fascinate you to no end. He is a great person who knows a lot and is willing to share, but only if he likes you and you get to know him. So get to know him, and it will be a great experience. Class was pretty easy; not about the grade with him.", "He gives unclear lectures filled with off-topic interjections and ramblings. PPT slides directly copied from the textbook are used for \"lectures\". Boring classes with zero group projects, no creativity. I often walked out of class due to being so frustrated. I barely studied and still gots A's on all my papers and midterms. A total waste. Avoid!", "LWL meaning laughs while learning.He is an excellent teacher. You learn alot and he makes it interesting.", "This guy is amazing. Lots of work but he really pushes you to do well and learn alot. Take him if you can!", "He was a jerk. Had favorites, which he chose the first day of class and if you are not in that group he occasionally pokes fun at you for not knowing an answer and humiliates you in front of everyone. Says you are making up stuff too, and humiliates you in that manner also. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS, he can HURT you if you are sensitive!", "I took Calc 1 as a freshman. In highschool, math was my best subject. He did not do well at explaining WHY he was doing things. He would just go through examples. By far the worst teacher I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. There are other teachers that offer Calculus and I have heard much much better things about him.", "Knows his stuff and will prove it.", "I took the class online Fall 2016. I used to study from Chapter Interactive mostly, sometimes from the huge book or power points. I took notes when watching each chapter interactive. There is some extra credit \"LearnSmart\" of 2 points for each chapter. Also, 10 extra points for taking LACCD survey. 1 weekly homework, and 1 bimonthly exams.", "This is the only professor I've had that refuses to put grades in the gradebook. I am paying a lot of money for his class so it is lazy of him to not simply do something nice for his students. He is hard to talk to, extremely boring, and only does things that are convientent for him. It almost seems as if he can care less about his students.", "Homework always returned late - class of 20 and have to wait 3 weeks sometimes. Kept classes late - our last one was 40 minutes late. For many assignments, he sent out another page of clarifications due to the ambiguous nature of the first set of directions - sometimes when you had already completed the work or only had 24 hours left to do so.", "GREAT!!! I took his class over the summer at Moorpark college and kept up with him just fine. He gives real-life applications of the material throughout his lectures & exams. Has a traditional teaching style & provides book problems for help; I did better only going off his notes. Write your notes neat enough to follow along when you REWRITE them!", "Very Funny teacher. He also makes a good advisor. Very helpfull. Go to open labs when you can, read you book, MAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOUR SPELLING, and listen close(he does talk differently). You should be fine if you have him.", "OMG- Do not take his class, he is a horrible teacher. If you trip over the cord to his projector, he will whine and cry. then he will send you up for disciplinary sanctans and have you put on probationary standards. He will piss and moan about the most rediculus stuff. Stay away from him, he will ruin your college career.", "He was a nice guy, but not my favorite professor. His tests were online, but I never felt like I had enough time. His expectations on assignments were unclear, which made it difficult to get an A.", "absolutely awful. avoid him. he comes unprepared, bumbles around in front of class, and just reads the notes he displays on the wall over the lcd projector. he doesn't teach. i only go to class to fill in the blanks he leaves in the notes.", "No Comments", "Totally NUTS, but an amazing teacher. Had him for 3 classes and want to take another with him!!", "Prof. Coleman was an amazing man. A great professor indeed. He had high expectations and kept students working hard for a good grade. College isnt supposed to be easy. Thank you for the stories, memories, and belief in myself. You were an amazing man that cared for his students and their future and may your legacy live on.", "Lots of reading, naturally as it is a Brit Lit class. Lots of papers, but most of them don't get graded until the end of semester. Meaning you don't get feedback on your work and what you should fix (from your professor) until its all said and done with. You do get feedback from your peers, this is mandatory. Overall, its a mostly enjoyable class.", "Great prof. Always really into his lectures. Extremely approachable and helpful. No suprises in exams or essays as long as you attend and keep up with class lectures. Very knowledgable.", "I am very fond of Mr. Ream. I've never done well with maths but I did very well in his class. He is patient and makes sure you understand the concept. He allows you to make up quizzes/tests for partial credit. He is old school, but that is partly why I enjoyed his class so much-easier undrstd. He is friendly and very sharp. I would take him again.", "Run away fast don't take this class", "One of the best professors on campus", "I did not do well with this class at all. It was a 3 week course and it was way too much to handle. Familiarize yourself with the material, but make sure you don't memorize it like I did. The tests were multiple choice but confusing as well as it was the biggest percentage of your grade 60% and only 3 tests. I will never take him again", "AMAZING! Best class I have taken at OCC. Mr. Kinder is helpful and wants to teach you how to protect yourself! I have learned so much, and had to use it once and it saved me from getting hurt. The class is fun and filled which physical activity. Attend class and practice the moves and you will pass. Good Luck!", "Brooks is not a good professor. He lectures very heavy and if you don't pay attention you won't pass. Tends to make fun of students and can be funny at times but other times he takes his jokes too far to the point where he is very disrespectful. He will not change the way he teaches the course so don't bother taking him for biodiversity", "He is very monotone and not very helpful. Only test grades and a lot of reading.", "Good professor", "This guy is so great I honestly have never experienced anything like this in my entire life. Whether he is cycling around campus or lecturing, Jon Fisher exudes charisma and biology. I learned so much about both biology and myself. It really hurt when he left us to Ogilvie, a nice, smart but extremely annoying lady. Where have you gone Jon?", "What do you expect, people? Human Anatomy is no picnic. Professor Riegle is good. And he looks like Santa Claus, isn't that cool?", "Prob the best prof I've ever had. I remember going into that class with no hope at all and little interest as it was my first 3000 lvl clss, when I saw the reserve reading package i nearly dropped the course bec of its size But truly one of the few teachers that actually teaches you sth that u will never forget & changes ur viewpoint on imp matters", "He gives 10 bonus points every test plus extra credit constantly. You don't have to show up but if you do youll get the extra credit. Constantly tells nutty stories.", "Vinnie teaches his students that the pursuit of knowledge is not a burden, but a worthy goal. Some find his classes stressful because the learning process is not as painful as they have grown to expect. His lectures are not for the cynics and jaded of heart. Keep your mind open and you will learn more than you thought possible with so much peace.", "ATTENDANCE IS VITAL!!!He tells you what he wants and how he wants it.Midterm a bit hard,final is essay format.You are required to teach in a group setting.The teaches can be difficult depending on your lab instructor, some can be VERY picky. Make sure your teach group interacts your grade depends on them helping you and asking the right questions.", "class is more like a book club, class was huge (about 100+ people). he'll call you out for talking or leaving early so dont do it (he'll actually stop class until you contribute). you learn a lot from the cultural events you attend. its hard to get into the grove of writing 2-4 pages a week in blogs because he wants them done a VERY CERTAIN WAY", "What an awesome class!Prof Hupp is one of the best teachers I've ever had! Made lectures fun and interesting, even with some boring materials. The exams aren't too hard either. Multiple choice questions and some gimmies :) Great professor makes this a great class! Definately worth taking!! (even if psyc isn't your major) THE BESTTT!! :)", "he's awesome. Lots of blackboard work, but he's really helpful and makes things interesting.", "Even if you follow his feedback, it doesn't help future grades. Unnecessarily harsh in general communication. That being said, all work was online, didn't have to go to campus for anything so that's a huge plus. If it weren't for the feedback issues and his attitude toward students, I'd rate higher and consider taking again. Tough but doable.", "funny and laid back. his upper level classes are great. really knows his stuff. very confusing class, but i think that was more due to the subject matter.", "Ultimate techer ever.", "he is the worst teacher ever out there. if you want to hear the F..k WORD ALL THE TIME,you want to take him. i was in a class of 24 students and just 6 people survive. the attitude of this teacher is the worst ever. expect that when taking this class. WE CAREFULL AND GOOD LUCK!!!", "he is the worst professor I have ever had.", "Decent at showing examples of carpentry. Reads straight from the book. READ the book to pass the mid-term and final! However, if you want real knowledge of technical theater, go to shop!!!", "Easy and really helpful teacher, if you don't want to learn don't take him...I mean for people who are stubborn or think they know already how to play guitar- think again. This class is \"classical\" guitar and he teaches the standard method- strict positioning, fingering, notes, etc.", "He sucks, only take him if you love to study on your own.", "Do not take his class. His lectures are to mixed and he goes to fast to take any notes. His assistant was not my favorite to say in the nicest way. The final is 3 essays and 5 descriptions of people or places. I would advise that you pick another teacher. I mean look at his ratings... Nice guy but not a good teacher.", "These other ratings are bogus. This was one of the best classes I took at Cornell. Didn't learn too much, busy easy A, engaging lecture, and he's such a really nice guy. 2 prelims, final, section attendance, and discussion is all. Would def take again.", "He is a really great person. If you go to his class everyday he will help you more, but he is a little old so it's hard to understand.", "Professor Ludwig gives extra credit so if you mess up on test the few extra points will help you and that was very much appreciated. He also responds to your emails in a timely fashion. I took course online and was a little confused but once I got the hang of it I was good. You can repeat assignments for better grade and that's just fantastic!", "I hated math until I took Dr. Neal's Calc I class. Then I took his Calc II and he convinced me to be a math major. I'm extremely grateful to Dr. Neal for making me feel so confident in myself. He's very caring and notices when something is wrong with a student.", "Hes really funny in a weird type of way if you take him you'll see. The work isn't all that difficult and he is really lenient with when you turn it in as long as you email him explaining why you couldn't on the due date. Definitely going to try to take him for 1102. Shows a lot of videos and you pretty much just write responses to them", "Only one of the coolest professors you could ever ask for.", "I had Dr. Bodek for my FYSE-War, Trauma, and Culture and he was an awesome teacher. He is really enthusiastic about the subject and has a lot of knowledge about it. He is a very easy grader as long as you follow the simple criteria. A lot of reading was necessary but no tests or finals. Great teacher, easy class. Would definitely recommend.", "Pulls it all together", "Hands down, the best teacher I've ever had. He genuinely wants every one of his students to succeed, and will work with you to help you achieve your goals. Arlan isn't easy on you, but in the way that he won't let you get away with doing less than he knows you're capable of. If you can EVER take a class with Arlan, DO IT!", "I love this professor! He is so funny and no class on friday! I would recommend this class to anyone!", "I really do wish there was some way to pass his class. I worked so incredibly hard and studied like crazy and still got a C. At least he's not mean, but if you take him sit in the front row because he's hard to hear.", "No Comments", "The class was easy if you attended and paid attention and if there wasn't anything you didn't understand he helped out as much as he could. Made class very fun and always interesting. Easily the best professor I've had so far at SRU.", "Smart, clear, funny!", "I have no idea how anyone could give this guy a good rating. His midterm and final were ridiculous! He makes you look over 86 words and 30 essays when only 15 fill-ins and 3 essays would be on the test. Who can memorize that much information? Half the stuff he didn't even go over in class.", "I LOVE him. He is SO interesting and funny. Very laid back, so if that's not what you need from a professor, don't take him.", "Paul rocks. I cannot believe that none of the other raters have commented on the hotness factor. If you're reading translations from the ancient Chinese, it makes a big difference. Also very nice elucidation of the implicit tension between Confucianist ritualism and Hegelian dialectics. Thank you Paul.", "I found him very confusing. The text book is huge and he doesn't explain the concepts very well. If you can avoid him, do.", "such an easy class if you just show up and do the work. If you miss more then 5 classes you automatically fail. Do the online quizzes and labs right away to get them over with, takes like 3 hours to do everything and then you're done for the semester basically.", "One of those professors that you'll remember for the rest of your life. His lectures are engaging, funny and packed with information that sticks with you. He assigns a lot of reading and memorization because he wants the students to realize how much they're capable of. Every member of my class got to be friends with eachother.", "Stay away if you're a woman!", "Very very smart. Basically knows everything about history and can answer any question. Doesn't give quizzes and assigned homework, so if you bomb a paper or test then you are done for. Participate in class because he likes that a lot. He will grade you on that and he will call on you even if you arent raising your hand. He's pretty funny too", "You have to read the textbook or you won't pass any quizzes or tests. Quizzes are worth 16% and each exam is 20%. Majority of the time, his quizzes aren't based on his lectures.", "Dr. Bergeson is a fantastic professor, he is able to teach difficult subjects in a gripping way. He cares about his students and knew a substantial amount by name (in a class with 100 students). Lectures are interesting, and despite first appearance, the vigorous testing and homework schedule is actually very manageable.", "AMAZING TEACHER. Knows his material. Very entertaining. Makes going to class fun. Would take him a million times more. No textbook and is very straight forward about the exams", "Not quite sure why he has a bad reputation-simply go to his class (dont skip),pay attention,volunteer when he asks questions. If you take the time to talk to him after class or ask him questions he's actually very helpful and a genuinely nice guy. His tests might be challenging but he's very straightforward about what you need to know-no surprises.", "Great professor. His classes made the topic very interesting even if it's not your trackTests are multiple-choice which I hate. I learned a lot and the professor is a good grader too. The only thing is that it may be a little bit challenging for foreign students because of his cultural references and New-York-centrism.", "Shane is a stand up guy. If you show up to class and engage you won't fail. He always gives class time for labs and allows a cheat sheet for tests. Put in some effort and you should have no problem getting a good mark.", "Nice Guy. Good teacher. Cares about his students and encourages everyone to continue their education past graduation.", "Knows his stuff", "Very understanding and will always go the extra mile to help any student out. Has a heart of gold", "Don't trust him. He said kept saying not to worry about the first two tests cause if you get an A on the final then you get an A in class. Only problem, where did that final come from. Study everything and for every test.", "One of the best instructors I've had. Very helpful in all areas. Will do anything he can to help a student understand and pass the courses he teaches", "He's hysterical. Also he's a very good teacher. He moves at a rather fast pace, you need to do the homework in order to keep up. His tests don't have any suprises on them, he'll always give you the test from the previous year. By far the most entertaining math class I've ever had.", "Goes really fast and acts like you already know everything about fabric. usually tests are HARD. He even told us before the first test that half of us would drop... and he laughed. Also verrrry boring", "He seems arrogant and hard, but he's really kind hearted. He understands things, and is pretty forgiving for being late on assignments. He lets you resubmit when you make mistakes, and if you go to class you'll actually learn some things. He is a pretty good teacher. He jams a lot of homework into one time frame, but it's all repetitive...", "Not bad", "Dr. Ruckh is a great teacheer and knows what he is talking about. However, The way he presents history as a flow of evergy can get very confusing. As long as you keep up with the readings, it is an enjoyable class and you can learn some valueable stuff.", "Boring lectures, easy grader.", "I loved him. He's super fun and helpful. I'd take any class he teaches. He's really fun to talk to, too. Just an all around amazing professor, my favorite one so far and I'm on my third year of college.", "No good. Has no idea what he is teaching. He is also **** and discriminative to gays. Didnt he get fired?", "Had physics in HS. It made the class super easy. Liff is a good guy, hard to understand at first, but def the one id recommend to take for this class. I didn't have a problem at all, got an A. He likes to crack really lame jokes, so get ready for some laughs.", "Where I do begin this guy. I think he is old and senial personally. What he so called \"teaches\" in class makes no sense and he has these long random pauses in between thoughts. He even explained a problem in a foreign language during an exam and looked at us like we had the problem. Only benefit is OPEN EVERYTHING for EXAMS!!", "No Comments", "I found this guy to be a very lazy teacher. He is too lazy to lecture so he has you form teams to know your part of the section. Quizzes and test are hard. The curve is not all that great because it dont boost your grade much. Not recommended at all take other professors if you can.", "He's a great professor. He gives good feedback. The class was very interesting.", "one word: awesome", "Toni Hage helps you understand Chemistry. He is there for you, if you want to learn. Tests are not multiple choice, so you must know your material. All the material is covered in the lectures.", "ShortStory-I understand how people think he's pompus and arrogant, but that made me like him even more. I found him funny rather than rude. Made the class more like discussion period rather than just a regular lecture. This was one of my fav classes. I found him helpful, he gave me good direction for my paper. Exam was more difficult than I expecte", "Midkiff is awesome! He is very easy to understand and he puts all his notes online. He is also easy to talk to and very understanding if you need help.", "He's a nice guy but his teaching style is extremely boring. This class was one night a week, three hours and he doesn't give any breaks which wouldn't be so bad if he mixed things up a bit. The three papers we had for the class were on topics that only got touched on the week before the due date. Tough grader. Wouldn't take a class with him again", "He knows the material very well and adds many interesting details. You will enjoy his class.", "Very intelligent professor with awesome things to say. I wish he would have focused more on the texts, which were quite difficult. Lectures were only somewhat related to the texts.", "Prof. Shangraw will come at you like a raging hawk in the very beginning of each semester. Don't worry, he gets better as you get through the program and will eventually be a nice guy to know and learn from. He is very smart and loves BLUF, Bottom Line Up Front, and will tell you exactly what he wants for each assignment.", "Dr. K is AWESOME! He is the best teacher I've had at DePaul. He genuinely cares about his students' progress and encourages feedback about his teaching and assignments. He was a Catholic priest, but remains unbiased during class discussions. Participating is actually enjoyable and encouraged. Take this class!!", "i have no interest in sculpture whatsoever, cuz, it's sooo costly but daniel encouraged all of us to do our own thing and he respected all our opinon. although his lectures might be hard to catch onto sometimes, he's a cool guy* but dont expect him to give u a HIGH grade. jus a decent grade will do", "Prof. Roda is a HORRIBLE teacher. Ethics and Philosophy are great because they are subjects that allow a lot of personal interpretation. Unfortunately, this deaf/dumb/blind old man, who can barely talk, is a very closed minded individual. Though he TRIES to help you prepare with quizes and tests, he makes it virtually impossible to have the level of patience needed to do well in the class. Im sure he was an outstanding teacher 40 years ago.", "Nice teacher with a very positive attitude. His expectations are very clear, grades on a fair point system, simple to understand, makes the class a breeze. I do recommend :)", "Pretty cool and funny teacher. He's hyper and silly even in class. But the workload is quite a lot to handle. Also a very hard course with homework everyday, about 3/4 projects during the semester. Take-home tests (which are hard!) The manual he sends out during the first week is NOT helpful at all. He isn't that helpful either.Maybe that's just me", "Sometime difficult to follow, but is glad to help you outside of class. Provides copies of his notes. All homework is due at the end of the semester, and exams are take-home. Overall, Dr. Bowman is a really great guy and wants to see you learn the material.", "Don't buy the book PCC tells you to buy at the bookstore because he has you buy a different text. This class is really good for those who are interested in art history. If you don't find art history interesting, you'll probably think the class is super boring. Lots of memorization of art periods, artists, media types, etc", "Very straightforward. Easy class, no homework required. Stay up on homework to get a good grad though. 4 tests throughout the class. Tests include the midterm and final.", "by far one of the more interesting and intelligent professors i have ever had. he is passionate about teaching and his energy is contageous. would take any class he offers. great as a teacher and great to just talk to about anything. highly recommend!", "Save yourself and your sanity and avoid Dr. Stokesbury. Yes, he knows what he's talking about, and at times makes some nice points-- but his tests are absurdly difficult and he is fairly rude and abrasive. I'd steer clear of this one.", "He's a professor who is very passionate about his work. He is very strict about computer use in his class, he yelled a few times at students for using Facebook. The assignments are time consuming and not so easy, but he will help with any questions in person or over email. A very interesting course and I would recommend taking it.", "Professor Sawyer was a great and enthusiastic teacher. Very helpful in guiding you in the right direction.", "I practically have to do the entire lab before class if I want to finish, but he gives full credit regardless of how much you turn in. Quizzes are difficult.", "Mr Centeno is a very good english teacher. Its not your typical english class where you read some old poem and analyze it in a paper. He assigns topics that are interesting and actually affect us.", "Automatic extensions for homework assignments and open note midterm/final. Lectures are pretty clear and is always willing to help. Tries his best to get the class involved during the lecture.", "His lectures were very clear and often simplified the material for us. His midterm exam was much easier compared to other sections. All in all he was a good teacher in class and kept the class entertaining with his slides. However on the downside he would sometimes seem annoyed or bothered to answer questions outside of class or at office hours.", "I HATE HIM! He is vague and boring! All of his assignments were complete jokes and he had no idea how to explain even the simplist concepts. NEVER take a class with him. He is so unclear that I can't even begin to describe", "could be a very interesting class but its not at all. sooo boring. he stutters a lot and doesnt give good feedback to students comments and questions in class", "I took this class online and it was really easy. You read the book, complete the assignment, do a quiz once a week, then the final. Test questions are from the assignments. He is also very responsive if you need help.", "GREAT TEACHER ! HES TALKS ALOT, BUT IS VERY FUNNY. EXPLAINS THINGS VERY WELL, DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM REPEATING HIMSELF OR ANSWERING QUESTIONS.VERY NICE, AND HELPFUL, NOT TO MENTION HIS TESTS ARE SUPER EASY, I NEVER STUDIED, BECAUSE HE ALWAYS REVIEWS THE MATERIAL HES GOING TO TEST YOU ON..

Take Him!!!!", "As a professor, although he was really out there, I appreciatd Jim for opening my eyes to a different style of theatre. However, as a graduate advisor he has failed us miserably. He doesn't respond to emails or look over drfts, simply complaining he's \"too busy.\"", "just soso", "Mr. B. is the best speech professor anywhere. I HATE public speaking, but Mr. B. made us feel comfortable and laid back. He grades on improvement, not by expectation, meaning if you do poorly on one speech, but try harder and do better on the next one, he will take that improvement into account and boost your grade. He just wants to see you try :)", "Cool, interesting Professor!", "If you want a clear teacher go somewhere else the first thing he asks people in the class is if they have a learning disability, not taking credit for his lack of a teaching ability or vagueness on what we are going to do, I never had a class that basically is guess what the test will be on no examples whatsoever, but if all the class fails oh well", "(Taken - Fall 2014) I was so happy to have a professor like him in my first semester of college. He is hilarious. He's fun to work with. We did research, which was super fun! (My class got to do research on sex work comparing different groups of people)", "he is all over the place and disorganized but very fun to be in classs with. As though he took in too many caffene pills before class.", "He's traveled all over so classes are cool because he's actually been where he's talking about. Passionate about what he does and doesn't ramble. Fair and friendly. As far as his tests you have to know your stuff so study and you'll do fine. Def the model professor!", "Nice professor. His tests are all T/F and there are only 3 total. No other grades; no final. One really must attend class because some of his test questions come from random facts he mentions in class, but not many. An 80-100 is an A so if you just pay attention you should do great and always read the I am section in the book. Not an overload.", "Suetta is the man", "When i took him last semester he was cool.. this semester is differnt. He isnt very helpful anymore bcuz people took advantage of him. Im a strait A student and i failed the midterm bcuz He wont help on the chapters any more, which sucks! he does give extra credit though. beware: he changes! dont know what he will be like next semester..", "Great professor! Very fair with grades, very clear on what to study for tests, gives great notes, and is very charismatic. Very approachable, and seems to sincerely care about students. Only complaint is that you can't wear hats in class, which sucks when you're running late for an 8 a.m. but then again small price to pay.", "Professor Fogel is simply the greatest. He is so incredibly knowledgeable, but not intimidating at all. He is super-helpful during office hours and in e-mails and is always willing to meet with students even if it means coming outside his office hours. He is tough, but so open to hearing other students' ideas. So glad I took his class!", "The best prof at york... just read his notes and you will definately do well....", "Can be arrogant at times, but overall he really does care and wants you to succeed....you really can't avoid him if you have to take lab--so just get used to his style. realize he has good intentions. Approachable most of the time....", "HE MAKES THE CLASS HARDER THAN IT ACTUAL SHOULD BE. THERE'S JUST A MIDTERM AND A FINAL(WHICH ARE BOTH SO HARD). HE DOESN'T ALLOW ANY EATING IN HIS CLASS AND IF HE SEES YOU EATING GET READY TO WALK OUT THE ROOM, THROW IT OUT, OR PUT IT AWAY). IF YOU ASK A QUESTION AND HE FEELS IT IS STUPID OH MAN HE WILL MAKE SURE TO TELL YOU THAT.", "The other reviewers are mistaken. We only solved one kind of ODE: u'' + a u = b. Basic results from ODEs and Vector Calc (dot-products and integrals) are used to study physics.", "Todd's class is one of the best classes I have ever taken--certainly one of the funniest. To do well on the quizzes, you have to do the reading, but the tests are usually pretty easy. He makes lectures and silent cinema fun and exciting. Smart and funny.", "Kay Leach is a great instructor. I wish that more instructors are like her!She is the best.", "Confusing, arrogant, rude.", "I took this course in the summer and Dr. Albright was terrible. He was definitely not teaching at an undergraduate level. I wouldn't recommend taking AC 210 with him.", "Great teacher!", "He generously grades speeches even if they are bad and understands public speaking is hard. He wants you to succeed and was my first professor in college to see good in me. The tests are easy as long as you read the book. I've learned so much in this class so if you take SPE101 be sure to take him!! Ask about extra credit I got 25 points added!", "This class was definitely not what I was expecting for a seminar. Bell is definitely a hard-ass. But if you follow the structure for this class, you should be okay, you'll just **** and moan along the way. You just have to regurgitate his opinions, and if you don't like a film, he doesn't want to hear about it, so keep your mouth shut.", "No Comments", "He has high expectations for his students but this only helps you to learn how to do it the right way. Once you get through his first years class, his other classes are a breeze, he just likes to weed out the dumb people", "Loves himself way to much and definalty didnt teach me a thing. Dont waste your time he will make you hate sculpture forever.", "Brilliant, sweet, helpful. Wants you to succeed and does everything in his power to make sure you do! awesome guy", "Nice guy. Tries hard to make it interesting, but it's still a snooze fest. He does show plenty of little videos and commercials to break it up a bit. Test are straight forward and right out of class discussions/lectures. Go to class and pay attention, you got an A. Want someone to give you an A for being alive, enroll at phoenix or JU.", "Very, very helpful professor! if you do not understand chem at all, take him. He takes you step by step working out every prob on the board. He has a small accent but very easy to understand. Homework is rare, tests are difficult, but he will definitely help you understand chemistry. I would definitely take him again if I had to.", "He is not that hard if you just want to pass. 6 quizzes are 85% of your grade, but they are only few questions each. He grades purely on the curve. His teaching style is to give you a solid understanding of the material which enables you to pass any test he throws at you. He has lectures on YouTube, which REALLY help. Very light workload.", "Seriously, GO TO CLASS. If you don't your screwed. Do EXACTLY what he says and you will get an A. I have no idea how people can not get atleast a B. He practically gives you the answers.... Funny, enjoyable, dont care for people that dont come to class, gives attendence 2 times a class period.", "tests are hard, but he gives review sheets with exact questions on them, he is hard to understand, but if you do the reading and ask questions the class isn't hard. He will help anyone who wants it.", "Overall, great class! If you have a chance take the classes he teaches, you will learn something for sure.", "Knows his Circuits", "Dr. Garner is by far the worst prof. ive ever had. His notes in class are pointless because all he does is prove 2 or 3 equations and where the equations came from, then be able to work complex problems with little examples. He doesnt care about his students at all. We started the class with 100 plus students and today in the final there was 50.", "Mr. Tarski is old and hard to understand becuase of his accent but he is really nice! He comutes all the way from Berkely by bus and is willing to come in on extra days just to help his students. The quizes are open book and you are allowed to use hand written notes. If you come to class try and ask for help he will definatley give you the letter g", "Great teacher in CCSF. He's very funny, and his logic is very clear.

DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT STRONG IN MATH SKILLS!!!!", "Mr. Chapman is a great teacher, but you have to study for the tests.

Just going to lecture and not reading will not do you much good. Overall great teacher, easy to talk to out of class.", "Horta is a nightmare! The syllabus is good,but he manages to make you hate coming to class as they are excruciating and boring as hell. He blabbers on incoherently about everything else but the books, flirst with students and gets most of his facts wrong.He doesn't teach, just parades his ego. Although an easy class, avoid if you value your sanity!", "Damen was by far my favorite professor this semester! He is very enthusiastic about his subject matter, and SO funny. He makes learning history very interesting! He doesn't put grades on canvas, but if you do all writing assignments and pass all tests, you'll have an A. All test material is bold words on online textbook. Great teacher, great class!", "It's up to you if you want to get anything out of the class. It's so easy. Just do the work and you'll get an A. The lab can be harder.", "I enjoyed the way he lectured, but you really have to work for your grade in this class. I recommend you to print the notes out and just fill in the blanks. There was a weekly online hw and quiz, but they were usually pretty easy. Just as long as you put some effort into studying for the exam, you'll do fine.", "Great Professor. Loved the Classes.", "Very thick Russian accent, sometimes hard to understand. Overall a great professor. Explains in detail and will gladly re-explain anything you're not sure on.

He is knowledgeable, kind, funny, and helpful. Both his classes are excellent and have taught me a lot about the subject matter and life in general. His classes are great to get you in shape and have fun and learn.", "Although he was a nice man and very intelligent, the way he conveyed the material was very unorganized. I studied so hard for this exam and felt completely dumbfounded on the exam. He gives true or false questions on the exam that are extremely tricky and in no way indicative of how good of a law student you are. He needs to change his 1L methods.", "I know that Prof. Christie gets a bad rap from a lot of people but the man is a hardcore instructor who truly gets the best out of students who work hard.

I enjoyed the class a lot, despite the monotonous voice that sometimes made me want to go to class, but since a lot of things mentioned in class was new, I tried to stay awake.", "Awesome, cancels class a lot, take home midterm, optional final", "Awesome teacher.", "Eierman is a nice guy. He loves what he does and that's obvious. However, this class is HARD and his tests are the most difficult I have ever seen. This course is definitely geared more towards chem majors than any other.

Good luck.", "Good attitude, very willing to help students, gives constructive feedback", "droge is passionate and very intelligent. overall a cool guy.", "more than half the class withdrew", "Irvine's the man!", "Hes a good guy... grading isnt entirely based on your tests/quizzes/etc - he really encourages classroom interaction so take advantage of participation points. I also took 501 with him and it was very interesting but kinda gross!", "Anatomy: Take this class at a community college where you can get lab credit, too! It's a waste of your time to take it with Reigle. If you happen to take his class, pay a lot of attention to detail... MEMORIZE EVERYTHING (slides, notes, etc.)", "No Comments", "Very difficult to understand what he is saying. But he gives you s review sheet for each text/quiz and if you follow that you'll pass. I don't even listen to what he lectures becuase more than half will never be on a test.", "Haynie's class was very easy. Tests straightforward and right off the study guide. Slightly boring at times, but his demonstration of what a curtsey is made my semester!", "Very good teacher. Very clear and precise at explaining everything.

Doesn't do much animals.", "I was not a history major, but I took 3 classes with David due to his ability to engage and inspire all of those in his presence.

His class was awesome.", "Professor Damen is one of the most enthusiastic professors you will have. You can tell he loves what he is lecturing about and it makes the class bearable. He is clear on what he expects papers to look like, and what the test material will be on. If you need to take a history credit take this one.", "Promises to be \"your statistician for life\" but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego. Excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself. Take another professor for this required class if you can", "Really easy class, the hw is worth 50% of your grade. Midterm was easy but the final was harder. Read and ask TA if you have questions but if your TA sucks then good luck in the 2nd half of the hw.", "This guy's heart is in the right place for sure, but unfortunately he's very difficult to understand. He doesn't answer questions clearly and talks to the board.

Otherwise...bad.", "Great guy.....great class....a little phony though.", "It had been a pleasure to be in this class. Frank has a world of knowledge he is intelligent and resourceful. Also, if he does not have an answer to your question(s) he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll research it and attend the next class with an eagerness to share the information he has found.

He is very clear, and very fair! 6 quizzes drops 2, 3 tests drops 1, one paper , and a final. Class is 90% lecture based, so showing up is important, but he leaves it up to you. Would take another class with him any day. Favorite teacher at Moorpark so far!", "Read your book and teach yourself. He's a great teacher and he explains the material clearly... after you've already taken the test.

He was willing to go beyohd the extra mile to help us.", "Great Professor. He's eager to teach and for his students to learn. Don't take him if you're just into getting an \"easy\" grade.

Take somebody else, especialy if you have to take organic chemistry with this class.", "extremely knowledgable. you will learn twice as much with johnson as you would in the same class with diff. professor. take johnson if you want to be a good journalist, not if you are looking for ease.", "His exams are incredibly specific and unless you start studying 2 weeks before the exam, do not expect higher than a 70 on any of his tests. I rewrote the entire textbook and went to the learning center to review for his class. I ended up getting an A but I worked for it. He knows his exams are hard though so he's a bit more lenient with the gradin", "I should have listened to the reviews on here! Avoid this instructor at all cost!! I started the class, did my first assignment, got 4 out of 5 correct, and received a 50% grade! Unrealistic expectations from this instructor! Dropped this class after the first quiz to get a refund.", "Allen has opened up my mind to the possibilities and talents i can explore within myself.

My chemistry was good in high school but this professor made it even easier to understand for me with great explanation and examples. he knows the chemistry really well u can almost ask any question and he knows the answer. Really great personality with a lot of knowledge !", "He was probably my favourite prof at waterloo!", "Mr. Tyson is an inspiration. If you plan to use any college degree for any area, you should take his biology course. While his daily tests are annoying & if you don't keep up, you're flunking by the 2nd week. But if you read the daily requirement you will have no problem with the simple tests. It prepares anyone how to study for a college cours", "Great teacher! Really wants his students to get Anatomy! Just go to class and pay attention and do a little bit of studying before tests and you should be fine!!", "good-natured and fun, one of my favorite classes. the readings were enjoyable, too.", "No Comments", "This class felt like my high school math classes.

I would recommend him to anyone.", "He is so funny and a lot of fun. I loved being in his class because he was nice and helpful. He is willing to work with you if something happens and you cant get your stuff done. He is a great guy, but beware of the first day of class,...its interesting:)", "Nice guy, but long lectures. I had him for 3 hours once a week & most of the class was gone halfway through. Class is straight lecture with no powerpoint or visual aid, so easy to zone out. 2 essay tests worth half your grade, so outline and prepare well for those, & go to SI sessions! Extra credit is offered but ya gotta be there", "Professor Burk is the best mathematics professor you will ever have. EXTREMELY helpful and really cares about his students. Very fair quizzes and exams. Gives a lot of homework, but it helps with factoring in your final grade.", "No Comments", "Professor K is an angel from above!! He is such an intelligent man.

Just do the online quizes and labs, bs them if you want. I got them done in about 3 hours with the free 1 day trial, saved me about 37 dollars. I would definitely recommend him! Just show up and at least walk around the gym. Easiest \"A\" I have ever gotten.", "Amazing. a blast of a class. take everything with him", "Worst class I have ever taken at UNC. This is a pre req for med schools and dental schools and most people in there are taking this class for that reason. This class is extremely tough and they do not try to help or explain things well at all. If you can take it somewhere else do it! I made the mistake of taking it here and now have to repeat it.", "IGreat professor! You can tell he's passionate about the subject, and clearly expresses his expectations. He's also very helpful with papers and assignments. You don't really need to read the books, because of the films.

I took humanities 3 with him and his lectures can get really boring because all he does it talk and you have to look through your course packet and write down what he says.

He is the best prof in the department of biochem", "he doesnt use blackboard, or powerpoints, and is pretty hard to follow while taking notes. you kinda have to adapt to his style.", "DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY.

DO NOT TAKE HIM", "Masten, while I'm sure he's a great, harilous person outside of class, he's definately not that way in class. He is very unclear of this subject and reads straight from his Pearson PowerPoints. I will not take his class again because I learned absolutely nothing.", "In the main, I would say Dr. Bieber is quite demanding and depending the sensitivity of the topic can come across as a pedant. infinitesimal vocabulary, wealth of experience, however definite declivity toward student affairs, depressing. this course serves as a rite of passage to the EPE'rs, not for the faint of heart...the life of the mind!", "incredible teacher and unbelievable researcher...he has great insights!", "He just doesn't know how to teach to a room of 100 kids. He relies completely on unclear, vague PowerPoints, and his lectures are totally centered around describing studies. It's very boring and misleadingly difficult.

The guys knows what he is talking about.", "Buy a digital recorder!!! YOU WILL NEED IT!!!! Take good notes, re-listen to lecture, re-write your notes, trade notes with someone else and you'll do great! Prof. Rose is straight up, honest and helpful!

He tends to skip topics and trick you on test. For ex: on one exam (multiple choice) he didn' tell us that there was more than one answer, so while grading he mentioned it and most of the class didn't pass , REALLY? --BTW NO EXTRA CREDIT, NO REVIEWS GIVEN.

A real cool guy.", "The worst teacher on this campus, all of his assignments are unnecessary and do not relate to anything we talk about during class.

We used 4 books on what seemed to be totally unrelated material. His lectures make no sense whatsoever.", "I took him for BioLab. I was scared because I have never had a science lab before. It ended up being a great time! He is fun and helpful. The lab was pretty easy.", "I really enjoyed Dr. Baer's class. The choice he gives for exams is fair with different students teaching styles. He's a very friendly guy when visiting in the field and very approachable after class or during office hours. Sometimes it was hard to hear him during class, but he was willing to repeat any missed directions and speak up if asked to.", "Took him for my capstone. You have to buy and read several books.Grading goes as follows:attendance,participation, 3 exams(each exam is a essay/paper).Expect to write 3 exams around 6 to 10 pages each.Lectures are long and boing.If you read and participate-you will do fine.He is a nice guy.Not tech-savy so no powerpoints. Take notes. Good Luck!", "He is a brilliant man. One of the best lectures I have had. Very concise. Take a lot of notes. Very interesting. If you do most of the reading and have an understanding of the basic concepts you will do fine.", "Got an A in his Sociology 1 Winter 2005 class. He has a very abrasive personality, he'll get in your face and ask you rude questions. Sometimes his remarks are stereotypes which will offend you. Overall, his tests aren't too bad, make sure you read the book and review it. He does give pretests/take home tests, use these to your advantage.", "Very \"Handsome\" class....A bit challenging in the summer.. but great teacher to have taken it with...", "This professor really knows how to conduct a online class! He is a AWSEOME professor who makes the subject very fun.", "8:30AM 3 hour seminar. Quiz every class. 100+ pages of reading/week. Tough marker. That all being said, it was genuinely a privilege to be in Ian Spears 4th year class. It is the most eye opening, provocative and inspirational course at Guelph. He cares about his students and wants them to think critically about every reading. Take this class.", "Aarrggh!!! He is so fricking unbelievable. Decent guy but the bugger doesn't know how to teach. He makes physics sound like rocket science and makes ants at a picnic, the end of the world. I like his Texan accent though.", "Very Theologically Liberal narrow minded. Don't let him know if you disagree with his opinions, he will explode. Not a great teacher either. EXPLOSIVE TEMPER", "He says that a 'B' is a good grade and that a 'C' is not bad, and he believes it. He's friendly and easy to talk to, but just following his advice won't get you an 'A'...you have to go beyond the requirements and defend every point if you want the grade. Also, make sure you speak out in class and be prepared for pop quizzes.", "He is knowledgable, patient, and funny. Take this class!!!!!!!!", "I love Kent!!! It's A&P, so yeah, it's work. But he is ultra nice and helpful. You know exactly what essays you will have on tests, so if you prepare those in advance that helps a ton. The hardest thing is his TF on exams. He loves teaching and always remembers everyone's name. Always study a couple hours every day and you should be good.", "Useful for all majors, little unorganized, but easy and knowledgable", "Never had a professor with such vague instructions and unclear grading criteria. Doesn't teach anything on financial modeling, you're supposed to learn it all by yourself. If your goal is to learn modelling and valuation, you're better off going to a seminar like Wall Street prep.

Unbelievably sexy, too.", "We had two papers, a podcast to listen and respond to, and reading every week. Told everyone upfront to expect 6 days/3+ hours of work. Gives commentary back for each assignment, however several times I noticed a confusing response and grade and upon reaching out, he got my work confused with another student. You have to be on top of your grades.", "Thought the class was very good! He can be a bit monotone at times but the converstaions are always interesting. For a intro class I would say it was great. The tests can be a little challenging but they are managable! Overall I suggest this course!", "Tough grade. Do well on tests", "I have never been so serious and honest in my entire 23 years on Earth about anything, but I must say that this TEACHER IS THE WORST TEACHER IN HISTORY. He lacks knowledge of this course, he expects us to read and comprehend immediately during new lectures and he refuses to grant you extra credit if you fail poorly on the test.

He is a harsh grader but he looks like he have a curve on most quizess and test. Everything is based on the reading which can be hard to understand themselves. Somethimes he will go overthings that wont be on the test . overall its a hard class.", "I dont recommend him! he doesn't know how to explain, no extra credit, no homework, no study guide, three exams extremely hard, you have to study on your own and read the book a few times to get the concepts well.", "This guy is odd, kinda mean sometimes when you don't see things HIS way. Don't like how he interacts with female students. Weird. Acts nice, like your good buddy, and then can zap you out of nowhere. Material is interesting but he can be off the wall. Be careful of him is my best advice.", "Tons of homework and a fair amount of reading each week. Definitely a harsh grader, but he usually tells you what you're missing. Not the greatest personality, mind, and certainly intimidating, but it's been a year since I've taken his class and the information has actually stuck. Overall - difficult, but worth taking.", "he's a really great teacher- actually very interesting for such a potentially boring topic but his tests are murderous and he's a tough marker- highest grade was a B on the midterm and in the end the curve was not so great, also very understanding with papers,will proofread papers before grading and give a chance to do better, only problem is tests", "Professor Martin really enjoys the subject of stress management.

His lectures are understandable and he answers questions in a mostly clear manner.

No offense, but he certainly does not live up to the hype.", "lots of lectures, boring lectures.... however fair grader", "cute babe!", "Easy ASS online course.

He's a little sensitive too.", "Sex and Racism with this professors was the worst class I ever had. Some people arent meant to teach and Jeromoe Taylor is one of them.", "He always went over the scheduled end time.

He piled everything on at the end. It is not a good class and he is not a fair teacher.", "Very approachable professor. Understands that public speaking can be nervous to many, so he isn't harsh when he gives criticism. His grading is easy to understand.

Really helpful outside of class. Helps you find new ways to study efficiently. Sweet man who cares if you care!", "terrible, likes himself too much.", "Really knowledgeable, helpful, and approachable , but if you're the type who isn't a fan of tests and exams, you will have a hard time.", "WOW ok.... 1st of all, the people that say he's a bad teacher are just dumb people plain and simple. You probably could just read and look at the outline and still get an A in the class. He is ALWAYS willing to help you, breaks the material down so a 3rd grader could understand, and above all he's an awesome guy! My favorite teacher at TCC byfar", "WORST CLASS EVER, Stay far away from Harvey's World poly Sci class. His lectures DO NOT HELP YOU AT ALL, He has The worst reader EVER MADE (it is soooo borning and will costs alot of $$) If you like BORNING profs who make you read BORING EXPENSIVE READERS inorder to even pass the class HARVEY IS YOUR MAN! STAY FAR AWAY FROM HARVY AND THIS CLASS!!!!", "I really like him. Atfirst he may seem offputting, but he's really nice. Math is math, it's not fun. But he knows many people are taking it for the DEC, so there are several opportunities for extra credit. He also realizes and states in class that not everyone will do so great on the second midterm and the curve will be generous. (85 = A)", "Great man and great teacher. If you think that he is easy though you probably have only taken Calc I with him and not Fourier Analysis--and YOU suck at math.", "The easiest teacher you will ever have.Everything that he repeats 3 times is a test question.You have to do an oral report which sucks.But ooverall an easy A.You can be braindead and pass!", "This dude is a boss. While there is a lot of writing it really isn't that bad and there is no test. Got a B in the class and didn't even use the book; I only used it for the writing assignments which are weekly", "He is a cool guy and he is a fair grader.", "Dr. Neal is so awesome! He seems a little cold at first but after a while you warm up to him! he is so awesome! just sit in the front row and joke around with him! he is very personal.", "He's an awesome teacher. Best math teacher I've ever had.", "Honestly he's a great professor. He's not bad at all. All you have to do is show up to his class and listen. What he teaches in class is whats gonna be on the test. study his notes and read the sections he assigns in the book! i got an 84 on the first test and a 96 on the second. havent taken the final yet. To get an A just understand the material", "He definitely makes psychology fun, and interesting! Five years later I still remember a lot of what he taught me", "He is very hard to listen to, until he gets to talking about his own research, then it's easier to stay awake. Go to his office hours. Covers the same things in every class, but not clear in class on what exactly he wants you to know.", "advice to people who are registering for him for 107 lab you will never get a good grade I guarantee you. He loves labs and goes into toooo much detail. For 220 and parasit, hes very interesting. Hes a tough grader though. You study and study and study and you get a 60. But very interesting and enthusiastic abt his work.", "Owen is a really fun guy. Just make sure you keep up with your homework and STUDY for the tests and you will be in good shape.", "Buddy likes his flow charts. How's those working for you at the LC there Dave?", "Dr. Chapman was one of the most interesting teachers I have had at GPC. His lectures are quite interesting and his lifetime experiences and achievements are quite an addition to his classes. He does only offer two tests, but he does his review with the test in his hand. If you pay attention and take proper notes, you will have no trouble passing.", "Easy to understand but....could anyone be more cocky?", "Naturally ego/rude guy, supresses it well. Tends to insult jokes, but benign ones\r \r Strict plan, cuts U off\r \r Teaching ability = good\r book = great\r pace = SO FAST, even ppl w/ exp hav trouble\r \r Medium diff aside from pace\r \r DO NOT TAKE if first exposure to SPAN, or can't self-study, or if u miss >1 time. ~40% drop. Tech illiterate, figure yro", "He's not a good teacher at all. You do get the essay questions before the test, but they are very vague. His lectures are SO BORING I can't concentrate. Don't take him, his class is ridiulous. He likes to hear his own voice. And He's really ugly and old.", "This professor is great and gives a lot of real knowledge to the students, but he does give a lot of work. Thats the reason why students are giving him these horrible ratings, because they do not like to the work. He has a lot of knowledge of the Federal system...He's great", "Mr. Ream wants all of his students to succeed and pass his class. He's very helpful and eager to make sure that students understand. His extra credit really helps out if you're struggling. He's old school and might seem like a mess with all his papers flying around, but he's on top of it. Highly recommend him for your 1330 Math class! :)", "I feel bad cuz everyone clowns on him and takes advantage of him. He is a good professor although the class is not very organized...the tests and quizzes are similar, and he gives the quiz 2 days before the exam.. hw optional.. take 'em, why not", "2-3 page paper due every week and one 10-15 pg paper due at the end which is going to suck. And a group project on a chapter in the book. nice guy, VERY VERY intelligent and knows this subject up and down. just follow the syllabus on the papers and you should be fine. I would recommend.", "my stomach used to turn every day when i went into his class. good luck", "Was always scared to take a 3 hour class, but Joe makes the time fly! He has interesting stories;loves to engage with his students and encourage their intellect. Random quizzes help to refresh material but he is very helpful that he gives you wonderful study outlines. Only bummer is that he was TOO nice! Rude students cell phones always going off!", "please retire soon, Boyd", "i love dr. detwiler...he's a very funny guy and a great teacher...however, he has some trouble remembering names...it took him four times of meeting me to actually remember mine lol", "Great teacher with interesting experience and a delightful sense of humor. You'll learn a lot in his classes!", "Dr. Roter is extremely intelligent and has an intense grasp of the musical world backed up with a great passion for music. He also has a good sense of humor (although nerdy at times) and sets a high standard that encouraged me to do my best. Very interesting classes.", "Knows a lot. You will learn a lot from him. His teaching style is kind of dry, though.", "OMG!!! Simply the most amazing person I have ever met in my life!!! I truly love Dr. Wise!! I wish he would have waited until I graduated to leave though :-( So very talented. OMG i am so at a loss for words...", "Erases example problems before you get a chance to write them down, If you ask how to do a problem he looks at the clock, claims he won't have enough time to completely work the problem and just tells you the answer. He constantly messes up problems which left you more confused than you were before", "Prof Muckell is an amazing professor. Those who say his is a hypocrite or his life is a lie need to see the real world and get their bubble popped. His work is challenging but you will learn if you do the work.", "one of the best professors in the school", "Took this clas over the summer...was a breeze. The topics where interesting and i just really enjoyed the class. If u are unsure about the ratinngs take him over the summer and i garantee you will like it!", "Nice guy and laid back. All tests are take home and there is homework due weekly. Offers extra credit. Just go to class and get an A. Don't buy the book.", "This was the most boring lecture and I eventually stopped attending. If you show up for the lab portion and do the online homework on your own, you should get an easy A. This was a very easy class but required a lot of time doing online work. I think Jerry was a very smart prof, but he had a hard time dumbing it down to our level.", "commented more about the materials i was using than my ability or the piece i was working on. an elitest who places too much importance upon the more trivial parts of artwork (i.e. stretcher bar width or acrylics vs. oils) and not enough on the actual artwork itself. not a very encouraging professor.", "Dr. Lombrana is the best teacher I have ever had. He actually cares about his students and wants them to not only do well in his class but in their future careers. He does make you work for that grade though.", "He is an awesome prof! I loveee his class. Very interesting stuff and he makes them so easy to understand! Thanks prof. Bartel!", "He is one of the easiest teachers ever.I was definitely not one of his favs, missed too many classes, & even had to make-up a missed test. He doesn't even require a semester paper, it's extra credit. Anyone that thinks he is hard is retarded and should not be in a higher education facility. He does ramble about Guatemala, but it fits with the class", "Not at all helpful or clear about what he wants out of students. Worst professor I have had at this school.", "I think Mr. Jones is a great teacher, and he was very willing to work around my schedule and help me whenever i had questions :)", "THE MAN. He knows more about Psychology, then I know about my face. Way to go Norm.", "Dr. Osland is a fantastic guy and an intelligent professor. Nice as could be and I really enjoyed his lectures (most of them were interactive with the class so that helped to keep things interesting), but he was somewhat weird when it came to grading.. basically on all assignments and tests he took off a couple points and I wasn't totally sure why.", "Favourite first year prof, genuinely cares about students. With pre-lecture quizzes, assignments, etc., he gives you more than enough of a chance to bump up your grade. His midterms/exams are very reasonable. DO THE ASSIGNMENTS and GO TO CLASS: oftentimes midterm questions will be taken straight from assignments and in-class questions.", "Overly- inflated ego, pointless in-class discussions, typos in HIS OWN book, and EXTREMELY HARD tests (way too complex for college-level material). Horrible teacher.", "While this may have been one of the most boring and dry classes I've ever had, I did learn a lot from him. It's very concept-oriented, which I guess you either love or hate. And man, he loves those steam tables a little too much.", "Awesome proffesor. You have to work to get a A. Gives homeworks and quizzes every week but they are very helpful when it comes to the exams. Exams are tough but if you study and practice the hw and book problems then you have nothing to worry about.", "He tells great stories and his classes are easy. Just takes detailed notes and you'll ace the tests.", "Geosystems. Great class but he changed the tests from mulitple choice to short essay tests. A bit harder than he used to be. But a GREAT guy and videos in class are pretty sweet.", "He is very boring, and he loves to tell jokes that are not funny. It is not helpful at all even if you ask him questions. The class and the tests are hard.", "This guy is amazing. The best !!!! He is nearly 70 yrs old, but has twice the energy and euthasism than professors half his age. His respect for students and love of teaching make all the other teachers in McGill management look mediocre at best. This guy should give a class to the McGill professors on how to teach and motivate students.", "He is \"quite literally\" the best professor at CCC. You will learn so much from him because he isn't afraid to tell the truth. Lectures are long, but he is absolutely hilarious. Great class", "This was a PHENOMENAL Honors Capstone course!!! Clear and challenging, thought provoking and enjoyable.", "Took the minicourse for intellectual breadth. It's a easy 1 credit 300 Level humanities, and I am a lazy Engineering student. He just kinda talks for 2 hours then asks you to write a paper at the end of the semester. I passed, so I can't complain", "The worst class ever.", "I am now stupider for having taken this class. I can't imagine why schools keep hiring him. Learn everything yourself, but make sure to learn it his way. Impossible exam, 3 hours, closed book, 14 essay questions, about a million issues. I would fake an allergy to Oklahomans and transfer out ASAP", "Do not take this class. It was more like a boring theo class than English. I felt unprepared bcause I didn't have the Bible memorized. He also told us there wouldn't be a final, and there was, plus a term paper. I went to him for help once, and he was very unhelpful and told me I was bad at his class English because I was in the MSB. AVOID!!", "excellent professor!!! you must attend class if not you will not pass!!!! makes class intresting. the teaches are a lot easier than you think. there are only 4 and the groups are small. you are allowed to help each other out. overall a very helpful class.", "Great professor, unless your either lazy or a ****! Great texts, alot of chances to discuss. Lazy students stay away, you have to actually work instead of sleep in class. **** white students will object to a strong Mexican American telling it like it is. (i'm white but can't stomach ****s).", "Dr. Gallaher is an unfair grader. He will not follow his grading key, he will not return assignments from your first semester until your second semester so if you end up with a C you will have no idea why. He also has made students feel stupid when they ask him question and has had to apologize it.", "His tests are difficult because of the short responses, but he is a great and passionate teacher", "Honestly, who you have for bio lecture doesn't really matter but Tudor. however tudor is a great instructor, always willing to help students, very old school.", "Pointless class, dull lectures, don't use book, but an easy A.", "He really loves film, but he makes you hate it. He can talk forever and he can really put you to sleep. For anyone who loves to sleep, I recommend this class.", "No extra credits, no extra assignments. 1 test and 1 final. Tests are hard but based on the book. So if you read you should do fine.", "This teacher always has something funny to say. He has an interesting bonus mark system. Only complaint I have is that his tests are VERY long.", "He is very nice and extremely helpful. He really wants to everyone to do well. Though he only worked problems in class, he spent much time after class explaining and going over questions. His class did require a lot of work. In the end, an overall enjoyable class.", "He was alright, some of the lectures weren't all that clear and sometimes he seemed a little unenthusiastic but not bad", "Dwayne is an awesome Project Instructor. He takes care of the the project team in order to ensure that both the client and the team's needs are met without being intrusive. He allows PMs to take the lead in managing the project but is always available for support. You should be so lucky to attend his class.", "The best prof. EVER! He changed my life!!!!", "really challenges you to consider the material", "Really great professor. Taking his class is one of the best things you can do at Devry. He challenges you ways besides just tests. He is not crazy hard, yet he does know what he he is talking about, and will get you excited about the subject matter.", "are you joking never ever have i had a professor who i hated going to class with. the way he explains things are ridicules you dont even want to ask a question because he will make you look bad. DONT TAKE HIM!!!!!!!!!", "Overall great teacher! Make sure to read the book and do the study guides before each test, the tests get harder and harder.", "Pretty good teacher. He is however very biased towards the subject of any essay you'll ever write. Example: Write an essay about football and you're pretty much guaranteed an A+", "By far the best teacher ever. Wicked class a must take. You come out a changed person.", "McSteamy", "GREAT GUY!!! lectures are informative and interesting, he know ALOT and throws in contextual trival for fun. really nice and not too hard if you pay attention", "Professor is hilarious, all class periods are predominantly lectures. There is a lot of reading outside of class, some of which didnt seem very valuable. Hardly anything is assigned, and this class is an easy 4.0!", "Insanely good lecturer. Interesting to listen to, fun and extremely fair. Really cool guy overall; he'll talk to you about pretty much anything. I'm really looking forward to taking more of his classes.", "Awful. So ashamed I attend a university that allows this man to teach and waste salary on. His schtick is being wacky and telling stories but this is ridiculous to be listening to in a classroom setting. Avoid at all costs.", "Great class! But make sure you attand lectures and don't have anyone signin for you because I did it and I got into some trubles, my grades when down a lot because of that. Overall, I loved his class, it was fun and I recommend everyone to take it!", "Although he does get a bit incomprehensible at times, he is a pretty good math teacher. I am rather sure I am getting am A in his class and although sometimes I don't go for reasons that I just don't want to or emergencies, I never feel like I fell too far behind. Rock on Detlef!!", "Professor Reed has clear, well constructed lectures that specifically prepare you for the exams. This is NOT a memorize and pass class. You need to be able to digest the information and explain diverse factors to support a thesis statement for the exams. The assigned reading is essential. TAKE notes, his lectures are very helpful.", "I hardly used the textbook and still ended up with an A. He sets you up to excel and, for us non-science majors, it is much appreciated. I definitely recommend this professor.", "Loved Ian! He is humorous and kind. Will get into conversations with you if you're interested. His class is interesting to attend, I recommend sitting in the front because it's a huge lecture hall. The reading guide is slightly confusing but you can email the TA's everyday and they will clarify. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!", "Very good professor, helpful and funny at the same time. Make sure you take all 4 test and the final, try your best and everything will work out in the end promise. Take Bob!", "get out of pace!!!!", "Was nervous about this class, but I found it to be one of the best classes I've ever taken. Thielen is organized and wants to provide a class environment where student can learn and be successful. He works EXTREMELY well with hard of hearing students or disabilities. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TEACHER and would take him again for sure.", "I took this class these past 8 weeks in the Fall of 2017 and I thought it was going to consists a lot more work like people were saying. Honestly, I learned a lot from the labs we were assigned and he strongly believes in all students! There is nothing that couldn't be possible in this class. I would highly recommend him to anyone! Thanks again!", "Lectures were extremely unclear, the first midterm was a disaster. No one knew what he was asking. Tries to be helpful but makes students uncomfortable instead. He WILL interrupt you throughout your entire presentation, making it very difficult to keep things flowing. The content of the class is good but the instruction of it was very poor", "Really nice guy, down to earth, Gives easy quizzes and intermedeiately easy tests which include half multiple choice and half essay. not too demanding considering he is an English teacher. Highly recommended.", "Madden is a good lecturer, but not even he can keep me awake in class. This class basically depends on your TA. You can easily get screwed over on that. You'll be reading about 3 novels, and have a midterm and final. You'll have to study so watch out if you're lazy.", "Nice guy and amazing lecturer (certainly knows his McLuhan). However between the take home exams and essay you are ending up writing A LOT (certainly more than any other poli sci lecture or seminar)", "I loved having him as a teacher. Mark is really into craftsmanship and work that has time and care put into it. If you don't care about the quality of your work then he will mark accodingly. Respect him and you will be respected.", "This class is alot of reading but all of the novels are really good! I had to take this class for my major, and ended up likeing it!! He is kind of a goofy guy but super nice.", "He is not a good professor. He is very intelligent about the topic but cannot relate it well to the students. He does not fully explain himself. He puts code up and expects you to absorb it and be able to understand what it is all about. The MWD department really needs to get another professor that can teach this subject.", "Not a course for linear thinkers but the instructor was very good.", "He is fine. Take this course with him if you just want to pass, but not to learn to love math. Lot's of sitting in class and watching him struggle with technology BUT he is trying to get everyone to pass. All midterms are take home. You will get an A if you show up and try a little.", "Utterly mean, pretentious and obnoxious.", "Well I got an A in 125 and I wouldn't recommend this teacher. I recommend someone else.Graded on 4 exams (he drops one)and the final. If you need to take 126 and there is no else to take, just wait a quarter and take someone else. He goes over the material well, but the tests are 10x harder. Not recommended.", "The man is not helpful in the least. The class is boring and I had as much fun as I would have watching paint dry on the wall.", "I was always so scared of public speaking, but Bob Betts creates a classroom environment that takes away that anxiety. He grades on content, not nervous ticks or memorization. Super enjoyable class with fun assignments. I would recommend to anyone taking a speech class.", "Great Teacher, fun class, homework is not hard and gets easier after you do it a few times, one of my favorite classes I have ever taken.", "This guy came from Germany to practice his English by reading lecture notes almost word for word. You will get nothing out of class. You have to teach yourself how to do the class project, and he refuses to put a copy of the text in the library.", "honestly he is one of the most helpfull profs u can get at york. I have spoken to him twice after class about prbs with the course and he halped me out and was very clear about it", "Brilliant man, absolutely one of the best EKU has to offer. Take a class with him if you can, you won't regret it.", "Professor Burk is really a great, cheerful guy! He wants all of his students to succeed and is willing to do whatever he can to help each and every student get a good grade. He explains everything well and has very helpful office hours. One of my favorite instructors at Pitt!", "be patient with him and the good stuff will be there.", "John is so cute. He doesn't have a greater-than-thou attitude like most teachers. He has great life experience and is a true English gentleman. He is very helpful and puts his heart into his teaching.", "One of the best educators I have ever seen, with an outstanding passion for his students and the material he teaches. I still remember lessons he taught in my freshman intro psych class, and that was in fall of 1999!", "Very inspiring professor. Class is entertaining. Attendance is not mandatory, but GO TO CLASS OR YOU WILL FAIL. Midterm is hard (Bloom's). Other assignments are easy. Teaches are nerve-wracking at first, but easy once you get the hang of it. Group A has less time to prepare Teach 1, but everyone has the same amount of time to prepare the others.", "he used to be such a great guy. i looked forward to class with him. but lately he's just grouchy and mean and sometimes hurtful. no need to crush unsuspecting former students emotions...he'll be your best friend until you do something he thinks is beneath you...then he'll make you feel like a loser", "This class is SO MUCH READING, and Ruckh is not very clear about what he expects from you. The vagueness makes it impossible to get an A--unless he favors you, of course.", "One of the most interesting classes I have ever taken. I really appreciated that he didn't let idiots in the classroom get up on soapboxes and waste all our time. At the same time, he really helped us learn to think about the material. It was work and fun.", "not a bad prof, lets you use notes on exams", "Hilarious that people complain about the amount of readings in 4340. It's a FULL credit course. What did u expect? Gives away 20% of ur mark in weekly quizzes/participation. Much less writing than other full credits(3 essays, 18 pages total). Tough marker for essays, but fair & gives good feedback. Great course, fav prof,interesting, learned a lot.", "Don't let Bracken's personality get in the way of what he's saying; it's brilliant stuff. While he wouldn't do email, he was always available after class for questions or comments. He was also very honest, which hurts fragile students. But I wish I would've taken Bracken's lower level classes before this one because I felt lost half the time.", "What can I say? He's great. I'll take any course he's teaching simply because he rules so much as a professor.", "he is a nice man, and will try to help you although he gets frustrated easily. The material on his tests aren't hard, he just grades them WAYYY to picky, he will mark off 15 points for spelling errors, go over your test many times before handing them in, and everything on lab is on the test, but labs are easy!", "3 papers, peer editing before final turn in every time. Daily, manageable readings. Group discussions based on the readings. Participation is important. Funny, caring, and intelligent. Zorn is AWESOME!", "Lectures were fairly interesting, but the were no where near captivating. Dr. Osland was intelligent, but his arrogance made class a chore. Also don't tell him if you speak Spanish; you will end up having to listen to him butcher the language to you each class.", "Best professor of all time.", "Passionate, extremely involved in the topics and theories. He's very expressive in presenting information, great class", "Short and simple: you teach yourself physics. Do not have him as your teacher.", "Not a good teacher...This guy picks on you as well if he thinks you lack self esteem...He will pick on you on purpose just to impress the rest of the class..He thinks he is pretty hot too which makes me laugh.", "Bob Ebert taught Bio 1 to me back in the 80s. He's a great teacher, and after over 10 years including grad school, he was one of my favorites!", "very boring lectures, doesn't try to make them interesting", "PhD Microeconomics", "Awsome teacher, he prepares you very well before you take the exams. Everything that he teaches you will be on the test. Willing to help if you need it. Funny and loves to joke around.", "He was such an amazing professor. I learned sooo much from his classes. He is in touch with our generation and a lot of fun. I thought he was cute, too! He is an amazingly smart historian who values discussion in class.", "GREAT professor who is SO knowledgable about accounting. He always makes sure students understand new concepts before moving on and is very helpful. This is not an \"easy A\" type of course, but as long as you keep up with homework and reading you can get an A.", "His hands-on experience in industry helps him to be able to explain course topics in a way which is easy to understand.", "Professor Handschuh is a caring, entertaining and informative educator. While the class is Photojournalism, he teaches about the business of photojournalism and emotional care for journalists and how to market yourself as a photographer or writer and this is really valuable information. Highly recommended class!", "hard, but his work does have a purpose, brace yourself that c.", "Esay for me.", "Professor Burk is awesome! Best math teacher I have ever had. He truly cares about his students and goes to great lengths to make sure that everyone understands the material.", "Gentle Advice. Just Don't take any online course under him. He just uploads the slides and expect from you to learn by yourself. Never clear your doubts. You will not learn anything from his course. Worst Professor.", "what a guy.", "Haha, Best Name Ever.\r \r Fun course and good prof too, I guess.", "This class was about using the internet to learn about proteins/enzymes structures, sequences etc.. To begin with.. 1)terrible book, it made a fun subject boring 2)we sat in front of a computer and never used it, he lectured all 2 hours straight. 3)we're suppose to be learning how to use the internet for this stuff (continued in next comment)", "Chuck is a great professor, he frequently leaves the country so classes are sparse, and his grading sometimes can be questionable. If you do the assignments and answer the questions you'll get an A with no questions asked. He's a very respectable man and probably one of the nicest people you'll ever meet.", "I liked Prof. Sposito a lot. Even though I took this class for Hass, I found myself enjoying Sposito's lectures a lot more. He was organized, passionate, and really laid back. You get the feeling he really cares about the subject and his students.", "For a Calc Class (101), it was very easy. If you think he's hard, then you're just bad at math. Study a little bit. He's helpful and lenient when need be.", "Love him! He's so nice and helpful and after having classes all day, he made this 2 hour long class as fun as possible. He was so nice to everyone and really cared about his students and making sure everyone understood. Very easy to get an A without much work. I actually feel like I learned stuff in this class that I'll remember. Take him!", "Very confusing. Makes the simplest problems so confusing. I've never been taught math in the way that he teaches it. I'm better off teaching myself. Do yourself a favor and don't take him unless your good at math.", "Prof. Caravanos teaches an engaging course, making the material fun and accessible.", "No Comments", "The class was pretty boring, but the material covered is pretty stimulating. Dr. Kinney teaches directly off the slides, but he is very knowledgeable. Not a hard class at all if you read the study guides and go to class. Not much class interaction at all.", "Tough class. He seems to struggle to help the students who know nothing about coding, but is willing to do what it takes to help. Lots of projects which he doesn't go much over beforehand, and he expects you to try it on your own first.", "This was a great professor. He was fun, and always kept the class going. I learned a lot from him.", "A hard course, but a good prof.", "Wonderful professor who clearly cares about each and every one of his students. Whenever I needed help with anything he was there to help me. He is sort of goofy but, it makes the class more enjoyable and the time fly by. I suggest that you take as many classes as possible with him. He will help you through.", "I thought he was a good teacher. He explains stuff really well and is available to help.", "terribleeeeee", "Awful teacher. He doesn't teach the concepts associated with physics. When you go to his office hours for help he'll make you sit and wait while he takes personal calls then he talks down to you. He will mark correct answers wrong if he doesnt think in his opinion you knew how to do it. Take any other physics teacher.", "No Comments", "Moliassa is a really odd guy. He gets a little too enthusiastic about math. He's a good guy though and really helpful. He's good at making difficult topics easy to understand. Going to class is necessary to passing.", "He's very nice, and he possesses a subtle sense of humor, so if you don't pay attention in class, you're missing out. Care to read another reason you should pay attention in class? Well, he gives three T/F tests per term, and many of the questions refer to seemingly random, unimportant remarks he makes in class. Paying attention+reading the book=A!", "Almost impossible to get an A; he grades the papers/exams very precisely. Very good class to take though if you plan to go the law school", "he is the best for statistics!!! 8 homework total super EAS Y if you go to class, three exams including the final and you are allow to bring cheats sheets for the three exams! also the final is very easy!

A pleasant man and great professor.", "No Comments", "He is a subjective marker. Likes you higher grade.", "I need this class, how much is the midterm and final worth? Does his study guides prepare for exams. This will be my second attempt. Is he really helpful? Is there book homework or only web-assign work. Does he allow use of electronic help, mathway, and other calculators??", "He wrote his own textbook, and lectures out of it the whole night. Your grade will depend on 3 100 point tests and 2 star quizzes (which depend on memorizing).

He is very arrogant and really needs to retire.", "Todd is the best teacher you could ever want to have if Algebra has always been difficult for you.It doesn't matter if everyone in the class is getting it and you aren't, he'll always take the time to make sure you understand before you leave his class!! He rocks!!!", "Tony Hage is hands-down one of the best teachers I've ever had, if not THE best. I hadn't taken chemistry in probably 14 years (graduated HS a long time ago), so the fact that I did so well is a testament to his teaching ability. He breaks things down so they are easy to understand, does tons of in-class practice...overall, an excellent person.", "Sometimes his tests are easy, ans sometimes they aren't. His lectures are horrible, he is extremely boring and doesn't know how to teach. If you want to learn anything, don't take him.", "He gives quizzes that are hard to understand . The midterm and the final are a joke. The questions are twisted in such a way to just confuse you. (which I think is his main goal). You will love the class and hate it at the end. Most of my classmates agreed with me on this. Good luck, you will need it!", "This class was a lot of fun to attend. The lecture notes were a little confusing at times. overall I would recommend it to anyone.", "I really enjoyed the the class. He always had an interesting story. Very layed back, but focused", "Awfully dodgy character, if you ask me. I never like his \"guess what I'm thinking\" tests, especially the essays. Really didn't understand the usefulness of the tennis quizzes either. I guess I have a lot to learn.", "Mike is the best, amazing teacher great guy so funny, overall the best man out there.", "alsop and dervin are the two teachers u should avoid at all costs, he's very tough on grading, doesn't explain****, reads the labs inside and out.

Nicely dressed. easy to understand. easy to ask questions. very knowledgeable. makes class interesting", "One of the most arrogant professors I have ever had. Some of the most confusing lectures I have ever had was with him. Apathetic towards his students. He is now retired.", "A great prof. Very approachable. Will always make time for you outside of class. A VERY fair marker. Classes are relaxed.", "No Comments", "Easy to understand!", "Welp, I had this guy for tutor and surprisingly the words \"Never judge a book by its cover\" comes to mind. Although the tattoos and and mean face may deter you from talking to him, he is actually one of the rare individuals who will talk to students as equals and also JOKES around. Took him in Mr Li's, and Peter if you're reading this. HOLD IT, PJ", "His first time teaching in years. Lectures were not pertinent much and not updated online until right before final. Problem Sets were managed solely by the TAs. Prelims were fine. Grade in class is almost solely based on final, as stated by email afterwards. He's a decent person, but do try to stay away as far as class goes.", "I agree with everyone. Such a bad teacher. Actually he redefines the terms of a bad professor. Worst prof. ever. He's mean and seeks to humiliate his students.", "Super nice guy! Class requires lots of work, but he makes it as easy on you as possible.", "AWESOME TEACHER---one of the best. He actually has a degree in physics--unlike some other physics teachers at UV-high (UVSC). He explaines things VERY clearly. I would highly recommend him.", "By far the best math teacher I ever had. Took this class in spring and failed, so I decided to take it again in summer (everyone said not to because it would be harder) and passed with flying colors. He made the work so understandable! If you had questions he would help you. He went over everything and the text he used was cheap. Deff Recommend!!", "Dr.Zeitlan is such a great teacher,everything that everybody wrote about him is true and then some.He is such a caring person and really wants you to do well.I was very lucky to have him as my 311 math teacher.If you have any questions he will be more than happy to answer them.He always makes time for his students. Definately take him if you can.", "VERY hard prof. i didn't want to take both chem 103 & 104, so i decided to get it all done with just 115. chem is NOT my subject. i had TWO tutors for this ONE class! i ended up with a C & i was SO happy! eierman is a VERY cool guy and he's awesome in lecture & lab. he'll do some sweet demos in class. study, study, STUDY! he's funny, too. great guy", "I thought he was arrogant.", "He is probably my favorite professor on campus! You have to work hard, but it pays off at the end of the semester. READ the books there are a TON of questions from them on the exams. ENJOY!! :)", "He is an awesome teacher! NO homework except for outlines and outside reports. He doesn't teach you stuff u don't need to know. You get out of class early a lot of times to prepare for speeches. He is very helpful in explaining how to become a better speaker!", "Dr Gordon is kind of hilarious. I learned a lot of random info... he made me a better trivial pursuit player. study for map quizzes, they are an easy way to boost your grade, and the tests are really not that hard... mostly right out of the notes he gives out with the syllabus. he's a good guy, and wants his students to do well.", "I think he was a great teacher. He was helpful when you asked. The thing I liked the most is that his lecture notes are straight forward. What you see in the lecture notes is what you will see on the test. I personally recommend him even though some would say otherwise. He gives lots of examples and explains very well.", "Anthony is one mean (shut your mouth!). I'm talkin' about Anthony (and we can dig it!)", "Content is well-explained;it's the grading system that will leave you confused-your 2 tests during the semester mean nothing but you should still aim to do well, HW is about effort (not score - finish it all), attendance is extremely important, and the final will make or break you. I learned a ton and MCAT prep is easier having taken this course.", "He's a good guy. Be on time and do your work. Bio 11 is a great class especially for those of us that are \"biology challenged\". It focuses on environmental issues. If you make an effort - Murphy will help you pass with whatever grade you contrac", "I enjoyed taking Theory 4 with Dr. Roter as he was very clear about what he wanted in each paper, had a mini-lecture about each piece in class, and was very timely about returning papers and grades. As long as you take notes and are in class, you will be able to keep up with the workload. I highly recommend taking this course with Roter.", "Simply one of the most amazing classes and teachers I have ever encountered. He may be a bit bitter, slight charming. But the guy knows his stuff and will shake up your world a bit. Don't be suprised to see the class party together, cry, smile, and laugh.It completely changed my major and my life", "Avoid his class if possible.", "an odd sense of humor- will tell u that u're failing to make u work better. makes u redo ur work; really into details; not very clear on what he wants; very untraditional in thought; i liked his subs better", "The most unorganized teacher I have ever had. His tests are ridiculously long. Reads from slide to slide, just like all teachers at UHCL. My recommendations to someone who wants to learn .NET, read a book it?s basically the same thing but without a massive test. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU WANT AN A!!!!!!!", "Nutter tells a lot of stories- few of which have a lot to do with the material being covered. Quizzes come from the previous week's notes, and the exams are very similar to the previous semester's exams.", "This prof is the nicest guy", "Great teacher really funny. Pretty easy all you gotta do is like 4 reaction papers on a question in the textbook. 1 midterm 1 final. tests are a little tricky just study a little and you will be fine..i recomend him", "Has an accent, but doesn't make it any harder to understand. Open book test. Don't play around because of it though. Open book Math is not easy.", "Knows what he's talking about. Everything is explained on the syllabus. You have to read the instructions and follow them. If you don't follow instructions, you lose points -- no duh. Not confusing if you know how to read. If you ask questions via email, he responds.", "No Comments", "His class is very fun! Took his hybrid class, so we met once a week. All the material was online on canvas. He gives a notetaking guide that correlates to each slide in his presentations and you can use that cheat sheet on the exams! You can also fill the margins with extra notes and it's okay. Loved his class :)", "wow. this guy is great! first class with him, love the class, love the prof. learning a ton without a lot of buys work. best class ive ever had.", "Ruckh is not easy. But if you persevere and show interest and participate he will grow on you. I ended up ending the class with an A. A surprising A. Most interesting class i have ever took", "Prof. Delcastillo is one of the best if not \"The\" best online professor john jay has. No midterm or final everything comes from the reading. Pay careful attention to his instructions and you will do fine. Great class you learn lots wish he taught more classes at john jay.", "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AT 8AM!!! Lights off, slideshow, just asking for naptime. Otherwise he is very organized and tries very hard to help his students. Very tough grader, though. Be sure to take very good notes.", "nothing great, not hard to get an A , but nothing thrilling.", "Want a ancient professor whose lectures aren't coherent and so boring they make you want to rip your eyes out? Then this Hungarian psychologist called Erdelyi is your guy! You don't learn squat in his class. He doesn't take attendance. He gives 2 midterms and a final. Other than that, he's a really nice guy. He's probably suffering from amnesia.", "The way Jim teaches theatre is outside the mainstream and focuses the actor as an organic, empty vessel. The work is challenging and puts the actor's attention on the others and on the space rather than on the ego. This way of working is for actors who want to let go of the blocks that are holding them back from being in the present.", "Dr. Frank loves to teach and it shows! He goes at a pace where everyone can keep up. If anyone has a problem he will take the time to help. I had him for both lab & lecture and would definetly take him again.", "Great professor! Really enjoyed his class. Study your terms in book, take the quiz each week and you'll be fine. Doesn't take attendance, but must take the quizzes. Get out early a lot after about the first 3 weeks of class. Has a good sense of humor. Definitely recommend his class for anyone. Didn't know anything when I started and got an A.", "Lighthearted and fun, he makes math interesting. He tends to go too fast thru some problems, you have to ask him to explain it or slow down. Only 2 tests, add them up and divide by 2 - that's your grade. The tests are fully comprehensive, however he doesn't give very difficult problems. This class blew my 4.0 GPA and I still recommend him.", "very kind and experienced. interested in class discussion.", "The \"I don't teach, I profess\" bullcorn has been played out on me before I took this class; it is an utter waste of time and space. I pay his dang salary, so I expect to be TAUGHT something. I learned more psychology from watching Evangelion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) than from his class.", "He is a very nice professor and a nice person. He is fair. He really makes you learn. I did not know hebrew at all and now i can speak, understand a little, read and write! It is not easy at all but if you want to learn, he is there for you. If you ask questions on the tests, he gives you answers!", "avoid his class under all circumstances.", "This class is pretty difficult and he does a LOT of intense mathematical derivation, sometimes without the basics or non-technical explanation of what's going on. He's very helpful outside of class though - and is a really, really nice guy.", "THIS CLASS WAS BY THE FAR THE EASIEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT EKU. DR. HOLCOMB IS VERY NICE, A LITTLE WEIRD BUT YOU WILL LEARN TO LOVE HIM AND MAKE SURE YOU GO TO EVERY CLASS (NO CLASS ON FRIDAYS) AND DO YOUR WEB ASSIGNMENTS AND COMPLETE YOUR WELLNESS PROJECT AND THERES NO WAY YOU CAN GET ANYTHING LESS THAN A B!!!!", "He is very hard and seems to be a hard grader and so forth....", "No Comments", "The easiest class at assumption. No homeowrk. The quizes and tests are very easy. They are everything he states in class, but at times can word the questions wierd.", "Professor Delcastillo is a good professor, but could be very boring at times. Very easy class, failing or getting a poor grade in this class would be ashame, if you do, you might want to speak with your counselor.", "I have to strain myself to understand what he is trying to say. He speaks so softly and goes off-topic so often that you lose track of where you are in the book. He skips sections entirely and gives out multi-page handouts expecting you to understand it. Lets you do corrections for half credit for the first two quizzes and tests and homework.", "I took Professor Rose's internship seminar after taking his Intro to Media Industries a few semesters ago. There's absolutely nothing bad to say about the experience with this class. The discussion board assignments we had were like journaling and he has a genuine interest in how students will take their careers. Take him, you won't regret it.", "right now whoever gets him as a prof should feel lucky b/c he is definitely a step above the rest of the teachers here and i wouldnt be suprised to see him move on to bigger and better things soon...he used to teach at yale i believe.", "Super nice guy who will do everything in his power to help you do well in class.

A's not easy to come by.", "Excellent instructor--the best I've ever had. The projects were fun and I learned a lot about design--in other classes I feel like I didn't learn about design. His critism is direct and honest. if your lazy or make excuses all the time, he doesn't like that. This instructor is excellent!!", "Trav is great. His class is more a philisophical look at sociology than a true scientific one but is well worth hearing his point of view. His lectures are always amusing though it can be difficult to link his anecdotes to the subject material at times. Exams are easy and he'll bend over backwards to help if you ask.", "Professor is very smart but does not do a good job of conveying the information which he knows. Attendance doesn't really matter and you can get a good grade even without going to class but he expects you to know everything he covers. Relies heavily on the UCC. Very hard grader.", "an invigorating tutor, and all the girls follow him around like he is a peice of candy", "Does not teach. If you are looking to learn something that you cannot already teach yourself do not take his class. He is not helpful.

Also, if you're a hot girl = easy A.", "His class may not be the most exciting, but if you go to class, take notes, and study his sample exams, there is no reason why you should fail. His tests are open book, open notes, you can bring in anything you want to help you. Nice guy although he may be hard to understand at times.", "Before the tests, I just studied the text book and I never got less than a 90% on any of them. Because he gives you a FREE text book on the first day of class, you do not need to take notes. All the material he covers is right in the book. This spring semester of 2018 is his last semester ever, so NPVC will lose one of their greatest professors.", "He's a smart man, he should remain more objective though.", "Awesome Professor. Lots of energy, teaches with repetition, but in a good way. (song) \"Roll up your totals!\" and other lame but cute things work BEAUTIFULly as mnemonic devices. Really cares about student success, as long as the student cares themself.", "Gendron is HOT!

You will learn a lot and makes the class interesting.", "He sucks.He never lectures. he takes attendance and dismisses us. I don't get why i paid for this class if he never teaches us anything. i'm pissed this will lower my GPA for sure.I need to talk to a DEAN.We go to class take attendance, says he forgot his lecture slides or repeats a lesson and then we go home an hour early.I'm mad. Horrible teacher", "Im taking him next semester for social psych..and masculinity..is that too much of brannon for one semester or will i survive?", "If you need to take this course, this is the guy to take.

Hard if don't come to class.", "Shane! This guy is the best! He's one of the funniest teachers I've had. This class is known for a high fail rate, but Shane is very helpful and wants you to pass.

You'll think you're failing the class the entire time; however, it's not hard to beat the exams. This teacher is also incredibly knowledgeable, it's uncanny. He knows what he's talking about.

It introduces you to writing resumes and internal memos and such, I'm even keeping the book because I find it so helpful, it will come in handy. Not a lot of assn's..most easy.

I would suggest taking his class.", "Not a good teacher at all. Talks to students as children when he is the same age. Thinks he is better then the whole wide world. Still stuck in the Nirvana rock scene when that died out ten years ago. Never take this him for any class. WORSE EVER, UNLESS YOU WANT TO FAIL.", "He is a really smart guy; he's just misunderstood. He is a really good teacher for me and I did learn a lot from him.

Humorous, lots of energy and makes class interesting. He is highly interested in ensuring that students understand the material in order to prepare you for the world after college.

I loved his lectures but if you didn't keep up with the reading you were in trouble. The marking wasn't very fair because it was in such big chunks but he was still one of my fav profs this past semester- even though I got one of my worst marks in his class! And he also brought in the most amazing guest speakers :)", "He is confusing.", "Kaufman is down to earth and willing to provide help if you need it. To be honest his intro to philosophy class is the most difficult for me so far, because its very systematic and imaginative learning. I do not recommend taking this class early in the morning, because he solely lectures and drags on for the whole 50 minutes leaving me tired", "He's a decent enough teacher, although you will learn more through the assignments and research than from him and his lectures. Really tough grader on projects and papers and can be unreasonable. My main problem with him is that unless you are interested in venues or meeting/event planning he isn't really helpful outside of class.", "WORST TEACHER EVER!

Class is always interesting, though.", "Best class I've ever taken! I loved Professor Amrine. He was always willing to help and give insight into the texts and he was brilliant in lecture.

All he does is criticize rather then teach...take my advice and don't pick his class", "Bad professors dont waste your time with this stupid class because of this stupid professor", "Dr Ryan was one of the best professors that I've had. I do not rate how good a professor is by how easy they are. That said, he forced me to learn a lot of material that will help me with my career.

I would recommend him. Nice teacher.", "Great Professor! Math isn't my subject but I did great in his class. Took him in the summer so I had to cram a lot into about 8 weeks. He provides a lot of resources for help and responds fast. Great math professor !", "He's a funny guy. He started out every class with a half an hour talk about stuff not related to class at all, and often made it seem like the world is ending, but I guess it kept the class interesting. Course content gets confusing, but grades usually end up higher than I thought they would be.", "This is the first time I even write about a professor but I had to write about him. I took his class in the 1990's and he is one professor who I still fondly remember. He truly is there to help you get through your courses and give you a and along the way. I truly do wish there were more just like him...gracias professor. All my best to you.", "Professor Sharif teaches fluids in a very straightforward way. He holds review sessions before exams that are very similar to the exam itself.

My A was brought down to an A- because of it.", "Prof. Nielsen, while a good person, did not teach well. We hardly learned anything in class. He seemed to not care about the class or what he taught. It was not challenging at all, despite the fact that it was an Honors course. I recommend him if you want an easy A, but not if you want education.", "Biostats is hard! With his lecture book and sample tests, you will do fine.

If you put in the effort and are dedicated to improving, he will do anything to help you reach your goals.

There are lots of readings and essays. Still, if you keep you with everything, an A+ is possible.", "This class is not that hard. The only hard part is trying to stay awake listening to Kinney lecture. He is very boring but the material is not that dificult. He reads directly off the slides and you can print off the notes.

Biology 112 was very easy and he made it very entertaining i never missed a lecture.", "I liked his class because he gives a lot of examples. He doesn't take attendance, but going to class will definetly help you pass the tests! He uses slides & they are available for you to print, very helpful when you study!

He really shouldn't be teaching anymore.", "He's literally the coach Carter of english....", "He is definitely one of the best electronics instructors I've ever studied under. Very knowledgeable in the subject. His explanations are clear. As long as you do the homework and required labs, you should get an A or a B.

Sometimes he lets us leave a little bit early.", "He is a kind old fellow, but sometimes gets lost in mid thought, he goes off on more tangents than my grandma with alzhiemers, but many of his tangentsa are interesting an informative.

Yes, he does come at the subject from a unique point of view that I didn't agree with, and it was obvious that he thought a lot of himself.

Class can be a little boring at times but it is mostly because of the material that we have to cover. He does a pretty good job of using different teaching methods.", "Worst professor I have ever had. 50% of the exams are based on material that he breezed over in 30 seconds the first week of school. He doesn't use slides. Overall, well, I can't say it if I want this post to appear. But I have never seen so many peop", "Great professor. You need to study and show up to class, but if you study his powerpoint slides, you will do well on the exams. He makes lecture fun and he jokes around a lot. One of the best teachers at MCPHS and he genuinely wants you to do well. He gives some easy, fun questions on exams sometimes for extra points. I would take him again!", "learned a lot. :)", "I'm torn about this professor. There was a distinct rudeness from him at times that was very degrading and stand-offish. I want to maybe believe he is too intelligent to communicate with people of regular emotion? At times he was understanding, other times I felt his subtext was saying \"You are an idiot and I am more intelligent than you.\"", "No Comments", "I had a D in the same subject that i took in previous quarter.

I would recommend his section to everyone that wants to teach early education. Hes super relatable, funny, and has the most adorable British accent. Absolutely loved this guy.", "Gallaher is an awesome professor. The course content is not easy, but he makes it bearable. He is very funny and cracks jokes frequently. I really respect him as a professor. While you the grading is not the quickest, he provides very individualized feedback and it makes the wait worth it. If you need help outside of his course he will provide it.", "Dr. G is a fun professor who loves sociology and helping students learn to love it as well. He really cares about his job and it shows. I would 100% recommend taking him if you have the chance. We had 3 exams, all online and pretty easy if you do the readings and go to class.", "Dr. Grover is one of Castleton's best teachers. He is interesting and real. His class is not easy, but if you show up and take notes you should be okay. He makes learning fun! He is very intelligent. If you get the chance take his class you wont regret it.", "One of my favorite courses at WSU! Corvino is very engaging has a light personality, which gets you interested in the material.

Exams are not difficult if you follow the readings and notes he gives.", "terribly boring, just reads straight from papers, even when telling students not to do so. seems like an academic with no experience/ real knowledge. i've never had such an ignorant business professor, can speak condescendingly. seems like a moron, but thats just me", "He is very opinionated and arrogant. His ego is through the roof.", "He's a great lecturer, very clear and interesting. Also really friendly.", "I freakin love this man. Best professor I have ever had.

Take home midterm and final, easy essay question you can just google!", "the whole time i thought i was going to fail and even considered withdrawing after basically failing all the impossible exams.

Need I say anymore", "Defiantly recommend!. took him for my western humanities, and signing up with him again for east/west humanities. Explains everything very clearly, and sets a good pace. Very nice teacher", "Fine at best. He is disgustingly arrogant. However, if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it, which is good. Some days he can be very boring.

Overall not terrible but not enjoyable.", "Fall 2013 night class.He speak Cantonese, Mandarin, English and post solutions online.His notes are organize.He don't check homework, but give you quiz(total value 30% final grade) from homework problems. you could use a formula paper in exam.Final exam is open book, notes, so print all solutions from his final review and at least read them once.", "Dr. Neal reminds me why I love math!

Bob doesn't do EC and no paper. There are 2 exams he writes (60%), online hmwk (10%) and 1 department-wide final (30%) he doesn't write. Bob is great and his exams aren't easy but he gives you great reviews. The Final SUCKS! Bob never sees it so he can only help so much. DO WELL on Bob's exams you'll need it.", "I do not recommend this professor. He often mumbles, so it is very hard to take notes, and he does not follow the book. He is very disorganized, and when he looses your papers, he holds you accountable. He is also very unreachable, since he does not use his email or blackboard. This class is set for the student to fail, and is very stressful.", "He cares about the formats more than the essay. I wrote a very very good informative paper, and i got 65% because my outlines weren't the way he wants them to be. Very picky.", "Wiseman seems to really know what he's talking about. He's always willing to help, even if he seems a bit aloof. Only complaint is that he has a tendency to assume his students know the materials as well as he does. Good attendance is reccommended - but his tests are never very difficult.", "Mr. Johnson is very knowledgable about journalism and seems very smart, but his class is extremely boring. All he does is lecture and give power point presentations EVERY single class. The information presented is SO boring and I don't think very useful.", "No Comments", "Mr. Potter is very good teacher. You do have to study, but he cares. He knows the material and will give you extra help if you want.", "Dr. Taylor's class is very BORING! Do Not Take!

Talks extremely low, so you have to sit close. You're lucky to get an A!", "Medical Literacy was amazing! It got me excited about diverse medical fields. Ramin didn't lecture himself but behind the scenes, organized group of practicing physicians from Weill Cornell medicine. Every session was a case study and explored a field. The session on lung cancer made me quit smoking. So this class extended my life span by 10 years!", "HAHA did i say easy A, he never runs from a question. he encourages more questions. he simplifies all the material. his tests are written problem solving. but you'll get a question that wasn't discussed in class over 4 times. I know slow students who made it in his class so because he was willing to help", "He's a very nice profesor, makes a lot of jokes and tells a lot of stories. If you don't understand the material he explains it until you understand it. His test are very easy, do the lab hours and homework and you will past the class.", "Excellent teacher!

Don't miss taking a class from him.", "Professor Corvino is fantastic! He is funny and caring. This class consisted of a lot of reading and only 4 exams so come to every class and study hard for the exams!", "I didn't have a very good experience with him. I took him online and he was not very helpful at all. No matter how many times I emailed him, he always treated me like my questions were dumb. I'm a science major, so I took this class because I was required to. I tried to get help from everyone I could think of for his assignments but it never helped", "Although the lectures get long, I found the content boring rather than the professor. I loved having him; he made things personal with stories which helped me remember certain info and why things happened the way they did (critical to sociology). He thrives off of bantering with students and their participation. 10/10 would DEFINITELY recommend.", "Yes, his class is hard, but he teaches the material VERY well. It is a difficult course to keep up with...but if you don't slack off too much and ask for help when you need it, you'll be fine.", "love this guy", "AWESOME!", "I had him for honors intro to accounting.

One of the best profs in the department.", "he is a SUPER nice guy and LOVES history, but class is very hard. used to be that he had quizzes once a week which were a pain, but the tests were impossible so at least you could count on them to help you. got rid of quizzes so now it's just the impossible tests... VERY HARD!!! for a GER i would recommend someone else", "McGinn is a very fair prof. The course material is not the easiest, but if you remember his dumb jokes it will help you at test time.

Don't miss him.", "Allen knows his stuff inside and out, however he's well aware of this, and as such values his OWN opinion. That aside, the class is a breeze and only consists of daily journals, participation, and an exam. If you have ever watched a movie in your life, you could probably do WELL in this class.", "Dr. Farmen challenges your preconceptions, makes you question your opinion, then helps you articulate what you really mean. He is great at teaching lectures and at directing discussion courses.", "this class is a joke.he takes attendance every class but it does not count towards your grade. you can use the computers all class. just study the powerpoint slides before the test & you will be fine. one group project that isnt hard at all. i put minimal work into the project(92) & class and got a B. definately take this class.", "So confusing because he says he wants you to be creative but then shoots down your ideas. He tells you exactly how he wants it done even though its your art. No real free will in the class. You basically are only learning his style of art.", "If you enjoy movies in any regard, this class is for you. Mr. Cuevas is fantastically well-rounded in the world of cinema and will enlighten even the biggest movie buff. He assigned two papers with clear outlines and three exams that he reviews for beforehand. Attend lectures because much of the exam derives from what he discusses in class.", "lecture is not really necessary as it won't help you much. just skip and spend the time doing the homework. the tests are unpredictable but not unfair", "I don't know where this guy thinks he is teaching. It's an online class and is insane! DO NOT TAKE HIM! This is not graduate school but is taught like it is, it's a 200 level course.

Easy A", "Absolutely loved Prof Chaney! He's super hilarious, and he knows what he's talking about within the film industry. Do your work and you will get an A! There's two film individual projects ( midterm and final ), so it's not bad! He loves when people participate and talk in the class though not many talked in our class (maybe because it was an 8 am?)", "easy grader, very knowledgeable and easygoing. he really just cares if you are present during critiques(but mine was an advanced class). always seems happy to be there and enthusiastic about digital art.", "Lost assigments, lots of pop quizes.

Of course keeping up with the readings is vital to your grade (goes without saying), but he is the BEST professor you can ever take! He is an inspiration!", "professor ham is a disgrace to his profession. He beats books to a pulp..which is good IF he allows the students to do the analyzing instead of ramming his own \"correct\" opinions down their throats. He blabbers more than any sane man I know and he thinks he's God because he has a loud voice. RETIRE!", "I posted the last comment- Daniel is the only VA full time professor who isn't conceited. There are at least two excellent and grounded sessionals.", "If you think World Politics are interesting, this class will teach you otherwise. Hard to stay focused when you're read 50 slides word for word with little to no discussion. Seems like he'd rather be elsewhere. It's a shame because you can tell he's a nice guy. The marking is unfair - a midterm and final. You can't gauge understanding on two tests.", "Prof. Crocket is very knowledgable and very nice.", "Class was a total waste of time. Very little work and a group project where you can slack and a take home essay final (like an english class). Doesnt show what you know but rather how well you can write. Waste of 3 credits, not applicable to real world practises. (to be fair HR is hard to teach in classroom)", "Just finished Astrobiology for non-majors. Many of us thought it was our favorite class of the semester. Interesting topics and labs.", "Lectures can be confusing because he doesnt explain his derivations very well. Youll need the book to explain some things. Tests are kinda tricky.", "Very educated, knowledgable man. The class I had with him was phl100.

Extremely knowledgeable and sometimes intimidating, but is not a difficult grader.", "This man is a genius. Plain and simple.", "If you have Dr. Ream, run for it! He's a nice guy, but a very confusing professor. His lectures are random and scrambled. He isn't organized. His tests are pretty hard vs the study guide he gives out, and don't even get me started on the online homework. It's completely awful! I would not recommend.", "Professor Jeremy Van Antwerp spent the first 30 minutes of each 50 minute lecture talking about comic books and telling anecdotes. He did not seem to take his responsibility as a teacher seriously. He was rarely available for assistance with assigned material, and was generally unhelpful. In my opinion, he was immature and unprofessional.", "Very enthusiastic about the topic. Go to class as much as you can and you will do fine", "I really wanted to like his class. BUT I like Charlesworth better as a person than as a teacher.He just rambles on and on.He makes sense in class but if you read his book at home it gets confusing.I hate this class and it's not hard at all, he's very easy going and wants to be helpful.I just cannot pay attention to anymore of his boring repetition.", "What a guy! So helpful and nice, if you go to his office hours and show that you care, he'll try his best to help you out! Thank you Hassan for the great semester!", "Prof. Wilkins is an intelligent man. He constantly expresses his conservative views regarding****marriage even when it was not relevant to the class discussion.

Be prepared to work though. You won't regret taking math class with him.", "Dr. Thielen was probably the best professor I've ever had at PVCC. He is helpful, considerate, and SO clear in his direction. I learned a lot from his class. He comes highly recommended, as long as you're willing to really do the work, read the book, and study for the tests.", "Reading philosophy used to be tedious before i took this class. Dr. Kreiglstein has a wonderful teaching style and a tremendous breath of knowledge. All the books he mentioned in class were great reads. The classes always seemed too short and I was always waiting for class next week. I would recommend this class as required learning for everyone.", "The material is challenging but Delameter knows his stuff. Never had any problems asking him questions. He gets a bad rap I suspect, because most people around here don't want to put in the effort. They'd be screwed at other schools. Attend class, study, ask questions.

He uses examples that are not thought out, and you could argue that all choices on his multiple choice questions are correct. Even so, the class is super easy.", "His tests are based on his lectures, not the textbook. He won't let you record lectures. His grading is harsh.

He wants you to try- you slack; you fail", "One of the easiest prof I have ever taken. Easy A. Just study the hand outs he goes over during class and you'll ace the midterm and final. He def knows his stuff. Easy class to enjoy and easy A for sureeee....", "Bob is great at what he does. I would ask him questions after class and seemed to get better feedback from him.

He is a great teacher and as long as you pay attention in class you will do fine! He keeps the class interesting and you will learn A LOT.", "If you enjoy participating in class you have to be thick-skinned.

He is extremely knowledgeable but the only point of view that really matters is his own.", "I came to IU thinking I wanted to pursue an econ degree; this class made me certain of it. Great at explaining theory of models in-depth. Exams are not bad as long as you study, and exams always have extra credit question that make the average at least an A-.

He clearly picked favorites and if he didn't like you, your grade would reflect that.", "There is no feedback from him ever. I still haven't received any scores, am unsure about my grade and there is only one class left. He is not clear on his expectations and doesn't give much direction.", "I had him for a summer course at Penn and I thought he was pretty awful. He thinks he's a really good teacher, and he really isn't. He also really didn't care much about helping us. But he was easy, so I did get a good grade, and I did learn the basics", "No Comments", "Loved this class! No previous knowledge of the course and thought it was going to be very challenging, but his lectures are easy to understand and he makes the subject interesting. Good feedback on assignments and if you put the work in you will get a good mark.", "I highly recommend him!His lectures were crystal clear and based on the book. He always gave examples to support the theories he discussed and his exams were fair; you just have to put in the effort and study. Take him! I really enjoyed his class!", "Prof. Burton is an amazing professor. I loved every class I had with him - especially language & symbolism and theory in anthropology. He is a great guy - still helpful after graduation - even though I switched careers and moved away from anthro.", "Boring class. Grades kind of hard, but if you put in the time you can do well in this class.

He balances his class between lecture style and class discussion based.", "Funny guy, interesting so far.", "Really nice guy, very willing to help you if you have any questions about the assignments and creates interesting class discussions. Just don't be late for class and say \"Thank You. P.S. He's kinda cute too.", "We had a paper and a poster, which was typical for this class and not horrible, made the paper due in the middle of the semester which worked well for me. However, with assignments and due dates he was inconsistent and changed them frequently. I don't mind getting a later due date but wish he would make up his mind", "Tests are short essay, tough programming and simply long. Programs are very challenging and often take full time to complete. He's still learning a lot about .NET etc but fairly decent in covering the topic. He will look things up if he doesn't know.

Hilarious, helpful, and just a great professor all around", "Weber is a GREAT teacher. The class is a bit difficult, but if you read and don't have a terrible group, you should do well. Weber is great at keeping you interested and probably the best teachers I've had.", "Dr. Kent is a very helpful professor and is willing to help all the time.

Work hard, ask questions, and go to review sessions and you will do great. He is a great professor.", "I think he's a great teacher. Not unlike other teachers, he is willing to make sure you understand the material and spends the time doing so. With that said, his class is not easy. Yes, you have to work hard and read, but in the end it is worth it. If you're in for an easy A, get someone else; if you want to learn, take Tim Hill.", "Genuinely difficult professor to navigate, but that is mostly because he tries to make sure you understand the material, which his quizzes and exams directly reflect. Do not bother skipping class because he teaches directly from his powerpoints and will quiz you accordingly. Really tried and still made a 79.5. Yeah, and he doesn't round up either.", "Really easy class and the topics are interesting, but he presents it in a way that doesn't really hold your interest. Don't really need to go to class to do well.", "Although you learn a lot in his course, there is just way to much music to memorize for his listening exams. He expects you to know a great deal about music coming into the class, which not only means being able to read music, but also to be able to easily explain synphonies, string quartets,operas,", "This is my second class with Professor White. His tests are tough and he usually doesn't budge on partial credit. The homeworks and project are totally doable, just start on time. Overall, I really enjoy Phil and the way he teaches. I really feel like I learned a lot, regardless of grade.", "He knows the material; he's been teaching it forever. If you're interested in lower-level things and some hardware, you'll love the class. Otherwise, it's still a pretty simple class. Start assignments early. Read the book before lecture. Try to find exams from previous years as he gives no hints about what will be on them. The final was difficult.", "I had him for Geology 101. He was super", "Great teacher", "Repeats himself every lecture. Hands out syllabus but doesnt follow it. lectures off topic about world economy. We havent used the text at all yet but from my understanding we will be tested on it? so i suggest studying.I am supposed to be learning about investing in the stock and bond markets..but he hasnt taught us anything yet.", "I said \"So Many Papers\" because the weekly \"blog posts\" have to be minimum 750 words. Given a chance to make them up. He uses an emoji grading system on the blog posts, so I constantly had to look at the syllabus to see whether I got a 3 or 3.5 or whatever. DO THE BLOG POSTS EVERY WEEK. They are a HUGE part of your final grade. Real make or break.", "Good Professor. Not a lot of assignments and is flexible with deadlines. Do the assignments and youll get a good grade.", "he is mean. does not give extra credit or give any credit for homework. your grade depends on three exams and the final exam. its hard to pass if you arent already fluent in algebra. he doesnt explain much, he gets mad when we ask him to go over problems. many students in my class dropped the course.i wouldn't recommend this teache", "I would highly advise not taking this professor. He is rude to students. He will go out of his way and disrupt class to call a student out on being late. He thinks students should know most material already.

Knowledgeable and willing to answer any question. Tough in the sense that you have to do your work. Highly recommend.", "Yes, this is a good class if you like to slack off. You definitely don't have to come to every class. He shows ALOT of movies.

If you bother going you can learn some things.", "Easy class. Knowing the cases that will be covered before had really pays off. Know his examples. They will be on tests. He throws no curves, and is concerned with his students. Excellent way to brush up/get hours for the CPA exam.", "I really enjoyed taking Brother Zenger's class.

He is helpful and willing to meet after class if you have any questions.", "Great professor. Enjoyed his class. I felt he was very fair about grading.", "He's a little intimidating at first, but you get used to his style. He throws alot at you and expects you to pick it up quickly. The course was difficult at first, but got easier when I got used to his style. Definitely read the books and go to class!", "Really likes his theory and expects you to apply it and know it well. Don't get discouraged if he doesn't acknowledge your comments in class, keep asking questions. If you make it through his course, your other classes won't be as hard, definitely worth it", "He is one of the greatest teachers that I've had throughout my college career.

Had two classes with him and he is super easy and interesting", "he illuminated modern philosophy, taught me how to teach myself, makes school fun and challenging for all levels of intelligence and aptitude simultaneously, and soes all of this with a kind of stoner demeanor that makes him all the more approachable. Everyone can and should take from Paul.", "he teaches the framework but tests over everything. this class required more out of class time than any other class i have had (~80 hours so far)and yielded a C :/ would not recommend. i asked where conference hours were held and got yelled at \"in on the syllabus\". it wasn't, and he didn't apologize. just called me irresponsible. 0/5", "No Comments", "Mr. Salvo is a genuinely kind-heart and all around nice guy.

Most of the questions for the final did not come from his notes, lectures or the textbook, took hours of online research for each question. Highly recommend.", "Dr. Snider is a good professor. His lectures are interesting, informative, and he's got a good, funny personality. Just don't expect an easy A. You have to put a lot of effort into the class, and the tests are very challenging for a CORE class.", "Awful professor. He uses his lectures as a soapbox for his political views which have nothing to do with the course. His expectations on tests/assignments are very unclear, and he offers no help whatsoever. His essay questions are impossibly hard, and when you ask for help he rolls his eyes at you like he can't be bothered. Worst prof ever!", "these classes made me want to jump off a bridge.

It actually was an important part of my resume.", "Beneski is a little monotone, but if you pay attention he's very good at explaining and the class can be easy. Don't skip class.

Weird since it's an intro class.", "There are quizzes every other day and assignments every other week. The questions are ridiculous. He asks things that don't make any sense. This class is boring. However, he lets you take the tests in class and lets you talk to students in the class. Avoid this class at all costs. I didn't learn anything.", "He is a great prof at John Jay college. I took his SOC343 class 2016Spring. Take home midterm and open book final, A short proposal paper, a research paper 15page long. That was all.

I wonder how he got into teaching...isnt very good at explaining things...BAD!!!", "He is an okay teacher. Take notes and study them. He tests from what notes he gives in class, unless your in Forensic Psych. He can be a jerk, so try to stay on his good side. Most people dont like him but as far as learning goes, hes it.

Also he has very little actual graded material, so do good on all of them or else!", "I feel like Dr. Andy is a love him or hate him kind of professor. Because he talks about things he likes poetry, film, music and gives lots of factoids in class, it could mean amazing or bust depending on what type of student you are. I personally liked him because I learned a lot during class and office hours. He nurtures creativity. A family man.", "Most boring& uninteresting, painfully suicidal class ever.

I just read the book. Doesn't know the answers to his own questions. Assigned us a whole project (that was not in the syllabus) 2 days before the first part of it was due.

He cares so much about his students. You can tell he has a true passion for Aerospace and Mechanics. The tests are extremely easy; they take about 5 minutes to finish. He assigns group projects every month. Attend class!", "No Comments", "This course is absolutely a difficult course, regardless of the professor you have. If you're not 100% invested in learning Russian, then Gerry is NOT the professor for you. He is brutally tough, but he is an excellent teacher and makes sure that you learn Russian correctly and to a good level of proficiency.", "I wouldn't say he is a bad prof. once you get the hang of his class. He is a bit arrogant, and its his way or no way. When it comes down to it his class isn't hard if you read and attend his lectures. He is all about his research. I got a C in the class, with minimal effort however. An A is possible if you participate and pay attention", "I took this class through the internet. 6 papers, 1 midterm, and a final. You watch movies and then write your papers based off them and what you read in your books. It is a no brainer, he gave me an A, and I never even finished reading his book, Compassion. If you need an easy credit, take this class ( it was a lot of work, but he's a fair grader)", "trust me, im not one of those spoilt brats that like easy work or need my fone in class, but this guy, no!! do not take him.. his math classes make u feel dumb and stupid and he insults his students indirectly, i do not blame all the people who dropped his class, even if you are a math genius, ull hate math for the rest of your life.. DONT TAKE HIM", "This class seemed like a blow off class. There are barely any grades. We had like 3 assignments, a midterm, and a presentation. Attendance is what he grades on but it's only 10% of the grade. The midterm was outrageous and I'm pretty sure the average curve was 18-20%. He's the only teacher for this class, unfortunately. Nice guy though.", "No Comments", "Jerry is tough. He expects a lot of you and will not tolerate slacking. However, if you put in the effort you will learn a ton. He has a truly impressive grasp of the language and is extremely clear. If you really want to learn Russian and don't mind a challenge, take him.", "I really enjoyed this class. His discussions were important and relevant to education today. However, there is usually a RIGHT opinion to have in his class, you'll know what it is. Papers are only 3-5pgs and are ridiculously regimented (there is a thesis template). I felt like a was writing a MEAP essay again.", "This class was so easy as long as you paid attention in class and participates you will pass. his lectures are boring and consist of like a billion slides which you dont have to pay attention to because they are online. overall a very easy class", "No Comments", "Professor Blitz and Sarna were both great teachers. They don't give any tests, however they do give a few pop quizzes and some are scheduled on the syllabus. No textbook use but you will be reading several books. I would have to say that Professor Blitz was a difficult class to pass but well worth the challenge. I've improved my writing tenfold.", "You have 3 exams, two worth 400 points and one worth 200 points, and this is the only thing on your grade. The exams are easy to pass as long as you go to the study sessions by the TA's! I've only been to this class on exam days, most of the information you need is given to you during the study sessions. Just study and you'll do fine.", "Dr. G has gotten HOT over the years! And the clicking of the pen is even HOTTER! He's great, you won't regret it! Good luck!", "PLEASE IF YOU NEED THIS CLASS TO GRADUATE take another professor. Right now I have no idea if I am going to even pass this class. provides no feedback, all the students are emailing each other because we are all failing this is a horrible professor. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!", "Paul is an amazing professor. He was able to take very complex principles and fully explain them to the class. I left the class with more than I would have every hoped for. He teaches science with a philosophy twist, and although I started the class completely perplexed by the natural sciences, I now feel passion for them. Great experience!", "contrary to most, this guy is a great adviosor, but puts thing to the point which is great all of you who are dissin him as an advisor are prolly just failing and he told u that u aint gonna be a doctor", "I don't know what all these people were saying about too much math, it's just simple calculus based physics. In fact if you took AP Physics in highschool, and payed attention, this class should be mostly review.", "He reads his slides and posts them on cuny blackboard. He gets his slides from the textbook but, do not miss his class (especially first years) it really makes a difference going to his class no matter how boring he is.", "I loved his class. I definitely recommended taking his class.", "Tough class. If your not a deep thinker this is not the class for you. Be prepared to memorize two books for the tests.", "seriously save yourself an awful semester and avoid him at all cost. also the book is pointless and I'm so sick of hearing him repeat himself 4928097 times. im trying to save you don't take this.", "No Comments", "Mr. Cuevas is a nice guy, however, I did not enjoy him much as a teacher. He takes way too long to grade assignments, and never answered any of my emails. His class will challenge you, and it's a lot of work, so if you are looking for an easy A, you might want to find someone else. Again, aside from this, I cannot reiterate how nice this guy is.", "Velleman is an excellent teacher. I actually enjoyed reading the textbook (which he wrote), due to its conversational style and interesting examples. He posts all his lectures online, so attendance is not mandatory. If you choose not to go, you should still watch the lecture videos - they help with the homework.", "One of the nicest professors you'll ever take. He's totally getting an unfair shake by other raters. Extremely knowledgeable and doesn't rely on prepackaged notes (doesn't read the book to you). Higly recommended", "The man will make you work for your grade, however, in the end, if you do not know the information, it is simply because you are not paying attention or reading. The man laids things out for you so clearly, that sometimes, you wonder if you are truly doing the work! He is that damn good! You would enjoy his class!!", "DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASS THIS MAN TEACHES... He is horrible and does not teach you one thing. He gave many people and incomplete in my class because he changed the date of the final with no warning and has refused to answer my emails or phone call. It has been almost 3 months and I still dont have a grade!!!", "acts friendly saying things like quizes will be a breeze, but really he is incredibly picky. A right answer has to be exactly what he is looking for, which is usually very precise. I had him edit my essay, did his corrections + more and still wasnt an A", "Bakker is rude and condescending, but his class isn't too hard. He moves fast and doesn't thoroughly explain everything, but the book does and his tests aren't overly complicated. He does lots of clicker quizzes which can be stressful at times.", "Rob really cares about his students and their success. He is interesting and knows what he is talking about.", "3 Tests, no attendance. Very chill guy and you can tell he really knows what he is talking about. Lectures can be boring. Get the book and study his powerpoints and you can easily can a B or A. Best teacher if you have to take this class.", "The course material is overwhelming and difficult, but Dr. Kawchuk explains it extremely well and helps make it easy to remember.", "Nice guy, but ridiculous teaching. His lessons are straight from the PowerPoint. You pretty much have to learn all the material on your own. He treats the class as if we are all going to be continuing with biology. This class will lower your Gpa.", "dont take this teacher if you have trouble with math. i had to spend a lot of extra time in the math lab because his lessons were so unclear. i ended up dropping the class and just taking an online course. would not recommend this professor to anyone. AVOID IF POSSIBLE!!", "Dr. Chapman is an amazing professor! there is only one paper and the midterm and the final. he is absolutely hilarious and he goes over everything you need to know for the final/midterm the week before you take it! best teacher i've had thus far.", "No Comments", "VERY INFORMATIVE. VERY PATIENT. AND WILLING TO HELP. ATTENDANCE AND DRESS CODE ARE MANIDITORY. LOVED HIS CLASS", "Rothschild will only accept things his way. He rarely updates grades on bb. However, I learned a alot and would take him again.", "great class", "well, i think he's hot. apparently i'm the only one. oh, and his teaching is alright too.", "He gives a lot of work! HW assignments are only 5% of the grade but there are like 16 of them in one semester!However, he is a fantastic professor who encourages students to be both analytical and critical about the media industries today. Very engaging lecturer. Never a dull moment. Midterm & final are LONG and really overwhelming. You learn a lot", "Interesting subject matter, but Very boring delivery. His exams are fair, straight from the text. He curves grades and gives you the opportunity for extra credit work to boost your grade. If you read the text, you can do well.", "Professor King makes this class easy to pass as long as you do the reading, answer the study guide questions, and take the quizes and final exam (cumulative). There are no lectures for this class.", "An online General Elective about an introduction to Slavery. Interesting to speak with in person and helpful on writing my final paper, showed real interest in the subject and managed to teach effectively through an online system.", "Prof Cavaiola was one of my favorites. I had him for crisis intervention and I was never bored. His stories were always interesting and the material wasn't bad. I wish I could take him for another class.", "I think Dr. Hadley is an amazing person and an amazing professor. I was neither a theater major nor did I make him food, and he liked me! I found in my experiences that the students who disliked him really were \"the idiots.\" After my undergrad and master's degree, I have yet to know another professor with such balanced knowledge AND experience.", "This class was very challenging and sometimes stressful, but we covered a lot of material. I think this professor really tried to bring the best out in us. He also mentors us in a group of student designers to work in the professional world with clients. None of the other professors do that.", "extremely approachable and will admit that stats is not the most interesting subject. however, he's always available in his office and will walk you through any of the material. his exams are tough, but is generous with partial credit.", "Crazy genius/mad artist and former physics guy. Insanely talkative but perhaps the most knowledgable person about anything and everything, including ceramics of course", "This class was alright, but sometimes he was rude to students in class. The papers were a challenge, and the take home exams were no breeze. I would not take him again.", "Varries by the year. My semester almost everyone got A's, but he has been difficult in previous semesters. Very, very nice. Kinda reminds us of Dilbert.", "He is amazing! Inspirational speeches everyday. Just do the HW's well, actually read and UNDERSTAND the book, and study and work hard for exams.", "Avoid taking spurious nots in class, he derives too much, but gets to there.", "Awesome prof. I've learned so much about me and my writing through his teaching. Creative Writing is such an awesome class!", "smooth talker, diplomatic, probing, stimulates interest, great conversation. call him on his **** more, a lto goes under the radar b/c it sounds so good...", "Yes he's a bit of a low talker (it doesn't help that he leaves the door open), but I found him to be very nice and helpful with regards to assignments. Some of the lectures tended to drag a little from time to time, but he did a good job of laying out the structure of the course, as well as explaining his expectations for our papers and exams.", "I was really struggling in this course and he was very unwilling to help me.", "He's an OK prof. Lectures are dry but mandatory as he has weekly quizes that count for 15 percent of your total mark. 4 midterms no final and exams are all written and very easy. No need to buy the textbook even though he says you have to. Read the powerpoints and come to quiz days and you will get an A.", "The Best!", "A info crammer pure. He will assign a chapter and a quiz after each class. Which is easy to skate by. is unmerciful and lets satan write tests", "An evil, evil man. Loves to swear and yell at the class. But, don't try too hard - nothing is good enough anyway. Thinks he's a good dresser. Ha.", "Haven't understood him since day 1. This was one of the hardest things i've ever done. He doesn't explain the problem or how to do it, just writes it straight out of the book and expects you to know it. Hope this helps you decide to not take this class.", "I studied for hours, made over 100 note cards and watched videos on the topics he had on his slides (the slides have no information on them). None of that helped me with his exam as they are all applied questions, and extra material not in the slides. He does not answer any my emails with questions and simply does not care. He is horrible and rude.", "Instructor is horrible. Does not matter if you bust you butt or sit on it everyone gets the same grade. Does not require participation so most students walk and a few do all of the cleaning. Not a fair instructor. Too laid back.", "the yellow jacket", "he is an amazing teacher. i always struggled with math and thought i hated it...he makes me excited about math and it is now my favorite subject! he is one of those teachers you want to stay connected with, THE BEST", "Daniel is the best professor at uvic. I strongly recommend his class. He cares so much about his students. He'll let you do clay in 220...but you have to do it right. You have to want to do contemporary.", "Lectures are pretty well organized, but he feels like he must prove every formula. Tests and quizzes are similar to examples and homework. Gives extra credit on Friday classes for attendance sometimes. Not a bad class if you study", "My favorite professor at Denison! There's no one better than Mark. That man knows what he's talking about...and as a young alum, he's got some crazy Denison stories!", "Amazing teacher!!!!!!!!", "I LOVE SUETTA!", "He's a new professor in this department. Thus far the course I'm taking seems simple. He's very helpful and still has that zest newer professors have before they dry up.", "what a great prof. if you want to learn and advence into calc 3 this is the one who will give you the right knowlage to integrate and learn something valuable that will come handy on your next calc class. very smart and fun prof. loves teaching you new stuff.", "Rockin'!", "He's a good lecturer. At no time to you look at the slides on your own and feel completely lost. You have a long time to do the homework. Just do four or five questions a day. He will get into a conservative digression every now and then, but it isn't overbearing. Neither is his humor. Great class to be given a bone scorewise while also learning.", "No Comments", "Origins of Life class: Excellent teacher! He was really excited whenever anything new came up or great questions were asked. He will answer questions right when you ask them. If you talk to him about problems you are having in the class he will help you out with them. He gets you engaged in discussions. Tests DO test you but aren't too bad.", "Great professor. Smart, sharp, understanding. Always willing to answer questions. I took two of his classes during the summer. Tests are hard, study the lectures. Pay attention in class; attendance not mandatory, but he will give hints for the testsquizzes. Get a good group in 4220. I wish more prof's were like him. Would take again!", "Nothing like what I heard the course was like, just turned into sonnets and reviews. Essays are marked extremely hard and you aren't encouraged to think for yourself; you just tell him what he wants to hear. I felt very confined in the class and unable to express individual thoughts on the texts. very unimpressed.", "I hope he's a better teacher than advisor. After two years with him, I walked in at the end of my junior year to ask about my thesis and he didn't even know my name.", "Often put students down for asking questions, tests were somewhat dificult, but if you study at all you shoul dbe ok. if you can stand him, its not that bad. He wasnt very helpful inside or out of class. Vague and somewhat awful. Would never take again.", "No Comments", "Great professor", "he taught my senior seminar class, and since he'd never taught it before, just kind of tossed things up in the air to see where they'd land. thought it'd be tough, being required to graduate, but he kept all his same policies of attendance and due dates, meaning none at all. confusing, off the wall, made us cringe, but glad i had him after all", "Dr. Garner is so unorganized! When teaching, he writes all over the board with arrows everywhere and so unclear to read. Do not take him whatever you do. And the tests are difficult.", "This guy is a ****. The class is very boring and the first two weeks all he does is yall at us. He grades you papers very****ty and he doesn't believe anything is wrong with that. Overall stay clear from this **** and take anyother professor. All he does all period is talk**** . THIS IS A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER WARNING! TAKE ANOTHER PROF.", "Nice guy. Made class interesting. Pay attention to the small tidbits & asides as he finds a way to include them on the exams.", "Great textbook written by him", "very knowledgable in topics other than rocks... no bush 2004", "He is not clear and his lectures make class go on forever! He puts his lectures online, so you don't have to go to class, but class helped a lot. I didn't really learn anyhting from him, it was mostly just the TAs.", "Nice man but makes Math extremely confusing. Over half of my class dropped. I got an A but it was from studying the book myself and being decent at math already.", "You can tell he is a really nice guy and very passionate about what he teaches. His lectures can be dull, but he is extremely accomplished in his field so it is overall a pretty good class despite the difficult subject matter.", "He takes things a little too serious. After all it is a Technology School. He needs to lighten up a little, and cut the students some slack. I missed one HW and got a B instaed of an A. Very Weak.", "Very lucid. Plenty of relevant experience. Very enjoyable courses (any of them).", "Keeps the classes interesting. Even plays games with the class. Very friendly and likes being a teacher. Too bad most professors at Loyola aren't anywhere near as good.", "Helpful, clear. Allows you a good amount of freedom in his papers.", "For a lower division class, he takes it too seriously. Tests are essays. One essay about a book which isnt too bad. Quizzes on the textbook are ridiculous he has 4 I believe and picks very specific topics, which we dont even go over during lectures which are SO BORING. His grades is a bit tough considering this is a GE class", "Very easy class. He takes attendance but claims it does not factor into grade. Only 2, that's right 2 assignments in the entire class. A take-home midterm and take-home final. Only a few pages of writing required. He generally lets the class out early as well. Very nice and easy to talk to. A great choice for a free elective. EASY A.", "Very good, and very helpful. Most of class is self-graded, and he's very helpful on the parts that aren't. Expect to do a lot of reading and participate a lot in class. The class can seem a little pointless, but it's easy to fake it until you make it.", "Frank Foster is a great professor. He is very knowledgable. It's nice to be taught by someone who is in the business field!! Would recommend him!!", "Fox is my advisor, so I get to know him more than a lot of other students. He is supernice and helpful - a little scatterbrained with meetings, but that is easily forgiveable. I suggest him because he makes the class so easy because it's fun.", "Really nice guy - interesting and interested in subject. Monotoned so try to stay awake. Makes dry humored jokes which are funny when you pick up on them. I liked him. Take the class, its non-threatening.", "I didnt like him. I think is was very boring. Grented it was math, but still.", "Honestly, Half of what he teaches is based on experience. You know when a teacher tried too hard to make you laugh?.... He honestly made my freshmen year taking biology SUCK so bad. I hated every second. I'm an A student and this class made me struggle. His PowerPoint are 10% based on the Test you're on your own in this class. STAY AWAY", "Karthik is awesome. You learn without being tortured. He grades pretty easy and gives you plenty of time for everything.", "MACKO IS THE MAN", "This was a very boring class - he would go off on long discussions about topics we couldn't care less about. Tests required memorizing answers to study guide questions - you certainly won't actually learn any of this stuff. Overall nice guy, though, and definitely loves what he teaches.", "I had Dr. Pezzelo for Justice and Human Rights. He is amazing, great guy he cares about his students. Take home midterm and final essays really easy.Very interesting class you like hist. and politics.You watch movies and discussions after. Got an \"A\" Great class!!!", "Literally the easiest class you will ever take. Weekly quizzes that are based off of readings, easy to get 100% and the final is all of the quizzes combined...everything is online. Kind of sad he gets paid to teach this class when he doesnt do anything", "He's difficult to understand and he wrote the text so the book becomes useless as well. Tests are hard, attendance is needed to get a grade for clicker problems, and homework tends to be complicated as well. It's difficult to know your grade, thus my entire class was left wondering whether or not we were passing with an A or completely failing.", "Fantastic teacher, always very willing to help out! Don't worry if your first essay has a rough grade, once you learn what he looks for specifically, then it's a breeze! Can't wait to take him for EH102 next semester! Super cool guy!", "Economics is a tough field for me, and I really struggled in this class. I met with him during office hours and he wasn't able to offer me any advice. I spent $200 on a tutor and I still didn't do well -- I got a C+ which I consider bad for the amount of work I put into the class. He also made a mistake and recorded my grade as an F, and I had to go through tons of paperwork to get it changed. Avoid this teacher.", "This teacher has no grading system. You will not receive ONE single grade in his class and he randomly picks grades out for his students at the end of term. If you like to gamble take his class!", "Its unfortunate that a professor teaching a professional MBA program can be so incompetent. He came to class without any type of plan, and to make matters worse, he seemed to think it was perfectly acceptable to talk about himself the entire 4 hour class", "For someone who is all about being professional and being on time, he sure is late EVERY day. His class is rather pointless and very boring. He needs to teach at a college level, not kindergarden.", "I will admit Prof Burbank is a difficult grader, but I appreciate the high standard and always find myself working harder for difficult graders. I have taken numerous courses from Burbank and easily he is one professor I greatly admire and respect. I've certainly learned a lot from him.", "Dr. Karpinski made it clear during his first interaction with the class that he was there for the students. Although it was an easy class, he made sure that the students got the most out of each and every class through participation, great reading material, and discussion.", "This was a stupid class! you will not learn anything because he doesn't teach and he expects you to teach your classmates. he assigns hw, but never collects it. We only went over 1/2 of the chapters we needed to know for a department final!!! I'd learn more never going to this class!", "I took Elementary Algebra in NewSkills and thought that was good. Well, Mr. McDonald teaches the class better than the little CDs on the computer in NewSkills. I have the CDs at home and I learn more from him than I do with the CDs. I have learned and retained more from his teachings.", "Really really awesome. So so smart and he presents a very interesting view of the new testament. A lot of work, but really worth it. I learned so much. And he teaching method (including interesting uses of the word \"****\") is very engaging.", "He is very helpful and will help you with any question you have, he wants you to understand and pass his class. Test aren't too bad and he is a fair grader.", "Fred is a walking encyclopedia with a dry sense of humor. Anytime you hear a negative review, it's always from a student who couldn't keep up with him. He's a brilliant man who expects to be teaching brilliant students. The quintessential professor... a legend, and deservedly so.", "The use of your notes in very important. Study your notes VERY GOOD, and detailed. And you will pass. A 5star teacher in my book. he will always work with you if anyting comes up.. I'm in CO, BSN program, and i will still refer to his notes.", "Very good teacher. Very interesting class, and very interesting to talk with him. He will help you out if you are in need and also makes class very enjoyable. He's very clear with what he teaches and what he expects, I definitely think he's one of the better teachers I've had at SCU. Don't even need to buy textbooks. He puts them all on angel", "His lectures are long sometimes they can be interesting but other times he just talks and talks.", "His classes are tough, I agree with other students' opinions. BUT! he is very helpful for students to understand through individual tutoring during the class. All students in my class had worries about him before taking classed, but they has been changed after taking classes. Also, his personality and efforts are great!", "Excellent teaher highly reccomended. I took his online class. You can work ahead and you do not have to go to the testing center. 2 essays and a final. you will need the text books so get them.", "He's very good at explaining complicated concepts in a simple way and is helpful if you reach out to him. But his tests are IMPOSSIBLE. The calc class I took was an hour and 10 mins and he requires his tests to be completed during 1 class period. The tests are very long and if you go over time he deducts points. Because of this I am failing.", "He is not that bad at all. Bio is a class you have to study for, bottom line. He gives you study questions that ARE on the test. He is a nice guy, just study the outlines and you will do fine.", "Tough class but as long as you go to class and do all the homework questions you should be fine. He was the most available professor to offer help with any questions I had at UTSA. Study sessions every Sunday afternoon and every day after class.", "Bob is one of the best Prof. I've ever had. To bad he is retiring, he will be hard to replace", "Stickler for silly stuff. His heart is in the right place overall but he will waste your time on report format so make sure you follow the format he lays out to a \"T\". Can be testee and short for not apparant reason. Very knowledgeable but a bore to listen too! OMG he can put you to sleep! :)", "I got a \"C\" in his class and I studied my butt off. No office hours(he puts them 20 mins before class, but he's late to class sometimes, so it's basically like he doesnt even have them). his exams are difficult(but not unfair), and he is not a good partial grader. if you miss 1 step and it screws up the whole problem, he takes off a lot of points..", "One of the best teachers in the ME department. Would definitely take another class from Mr. Karthik/Would recommend people to enroll in his class.", "This guy LOVES to hear himself talk!

Learn alot in class. Give great tips in everything you want to know - from starting your own business to stocks. Enjoyable class.", "No Comments", "If the tests weren't do so detailed, I would consider this class interesting and recommend it to others.

That being said, he will not let you bs your way through choir. He's a professional and expects you to begin viewing music as your future profession as well. Bring your music. Get your notes.

Can be an easy F if you never show up or study for the tests.", "This man knows NOTHING about Chinese history. His lectures are unclear, and cannot field question from students.

The department should look for a new prof to take over the Chinese history courses.", "Professor Ferraro's lectures exciting and very informative.", "This was a great class. He made us think and come up with ideas that we would never have stumbled upon otherwise. He tackled evolution with a finesse that is admirable in a church school. I learned a lot in a scientific way and still found strengthening in my testimony. HIGHLY Recommend!", "This is by far the worst prof I have ever had. He is smart but doesnt know a thing about how to teach. Lies what he says is on a test is not. It not helpful in any way when it comes to asking questions in regards to labs/ essay or even on the subject as a whole. He just makes it more confusing.", "-VERY hard professor, but explains stuff really well.\r -HW = USELESS", "Really easy class. Take him if you have a lot of hard classes on your schedule and want an easy A. Requires a few papers but the rest of the time you just watch youtube videos in class.

I used to love math/front row student - now ...", "Vinnie is incredibly well-liked all over campus--and as soon as you take a class from him, you'll know why. He's smart, funny, and pushes you to consider other points of view in a way that doesn't invalidate your own. He respects your opinion, as long as you can back it up. Will take more classes from him in the future.", "Jay is a great teacher and is very clear in his description of Calculus II concepts. He is extremely funny and always engaging during class. He's the perfect balance of a teacher who actually does an effective job of explaining material and making class enjoyable.", "Arrogant, OCD personality.

He treated us like high school students.", "If you dont have the best memory and have issues professors who say thats the text book now go read it DO NOT TAKE HIM.

Nice, helpful, intuitive, and efficient. More professors should be like Murdico.", "Doesnt know much about the subjects he teaches. Tends to go on long drawn out tangents that lead nowhere. People only like him for the amazing ease of his classses. take a class with him, throw your money away.", "Dr. Midkiff is a really knowledgeable, and helpful teacher. He is always available for help and responds quickly to emails, usually copying the whole class so that no one is confused. He gives a few attendance \"quizzes\" if he starts to see a decrease in attendance. Overall, very respected and really knows his stuff. Would definitely recommend.", "Ian Speers is a amazing prof, he's the reason I'm considering to be Politics prof in future. He's really inspiring and helpful in class. However, he encourages to read and attend to classes a lot. So if you're not interested you might have a hard time.", "I LOVED Lesk's sex in the city class- would highly recommend this first year seminar. The material and field trips were very interesting and Lesk clearly knew a lot about the subject matter and added a lot to the overall experience. Sometimes it was hard to tell what kind of mood he was in which was scary, but for the most part he's a fun prof.", "Great", "OMG..DO not take this teacher...he is a old man who just mumbles and can't teach!", "Only had him for a lab instructor, but I wish I could take his course again. Extremely friendly, and explained things clearly. Attended a public lecture he gave as well, which was awesome. He knows his stuff, knows how to teach it, and is helpful and nice while doing so. Need more profs like him.", "Prof. Harris is such a chilled out teacher and very fun but is often unclear about assignments.", "Took class online. Do the study guides and you will have no problem with the quizzes or final. I found the class to be very interesting and I learned a lot about California. The book is outstanding and so was the class.", "Professor Smith will make you work for an A, but it IS achievable! Stay ahead with your papers, writing a paper the night before will not cut it. The worst thing you can do to yourself is skip his class. Pop quizzes are frequent, but easy if you take notes when he lectures and review them!! Put in the work, you will do great!", "The tuition should have had a better use. I only remember his pages-long list of titles now.", "Boring. There is little structure to the class and he doesn't always stick to the syllabus. The midterm is relatively easy, there are a couple of debates and papers but I didn't get much out of the class, you pretty much teach yourself with the information from the book. It's hard to understand the points he wants to make.", "worst \"teacher\" i have ever had in my entire life. if you want to fail a class, go ahead and take this \"class\"", "Awesome professor really knows his stuff.", "Lectures about himself. unbelievable stories. Guy is stuck in the 1960's. Literally didn't show up for our final. Easy A if you show up, but if your paying out of pocket not from financial aid or mommy and daddy. I was hoping to learn more. Very outdated teaching style. If your taking for credits, go for it. If you want to learn. forget about it", "He DEFIANTLY plays favorites. He will love and defend his Film major students and practically brush off other majors. However, he's worth it. I took him at 8 in the morning and he had so much energy! You just have to take his comments with a grain of salt.", "Easy...if you do the work.", "This class started off pretty well, he seemed funny and at first seemed like he was going to be a great guy....wrong! I did everything I could to stay awake and study and do well, but i still got an awful grade. My friend was the smartest in the class and only got a 2.7...so yea.", "His test is really tricky. His lecture doesn't help us understand mirco.", "Decent intoduction to Geography. Didn't have a problem with the class. He would sometimes get sidetracked during lectures. Lectures seemed to directly follow the text book. Took this class many years ago and don't remember much else.", "At first, the class seems great: humorous, discussion-based. But entertainment can only disguise the lack of content for so long. His arrogance and sarcasm cross the line from enjoyable to inappropriate. Instructions are oftentimes long and confusing. If you want to actually learn, don't take Harding. Overall, an extremely frustrating experience.", "This professor is really weird but in a good way. He tells very corny jokes but you can tell he loves what he is teaching. Grades a bit tough but he will allow you to redo something for a better grade. DOES NOT ASSIGN A TEN PAGE RESEARCH PAPER!!!!! I would definitely take him again, great professor and very interesting topics and assignments.", "great class!", "Great teacher and fun class. Two thumbs up and totally recommend this professor to others.", "Great professor. He is ALWAYS willing to help no matter what. He is definitely one of the best English professors that TCC has to offer.", "He is not my favorite teacher. He goes off on huge tangents, and it's honestly hard to pay attention. He's a nice guy and very enthusiastic, but I don't really recommend him. It's the first English class I've ever had that I didn't love, and that's saying something.", "He's not a good teacher and holds you late every freaking class period. The man is nice and a little awkward but is only good at teaching one on one. He gets too nervous in class to teach.", "He's not there to be a babysitter. So if you work hard his guidance will be beneficial along the way.", "he is pretty strict excellent lecturer tho very into it hes sexy also hehe", "She was a very good and a kind teacher. She used to communicate with the students very well, and is a good teacher to take for any psychology courses.", "Excellent class. Great teacher.", "Very realistic person and down to earth. Also is very knowledgable about the practical side of the Police and their studies. Very nice person and he makes the class easy to learn and take test. I would definitely recommend this guy.", "Johnston is the sort of teacher that probably should have retired twenty years ago. His classes are great if you want to listen to him complain about his personal life for an hour and a half, but if you actually want to learn something, you better find another teacher. He doesn't have clear grades and isn't very articulate either.", "Not the best in lecture. Be sure to pay attention during his review classes before exams as they always give the exact problem types that will be on exams. Typically curves the overall grade at the end of the semester as most students do poorly.", "Prof. Yager is overall a good teacher. He can be slightly intimidating (esp. when in a small class), but he tries hard to make connections with his students. There is homework every night, but it is never too lengthy or difficult; just be sure to fully read the Lecturas (don't skim) because the info will show up again on pop quizzes and exams.", "Giarratani is awesome. He has a boring voice, that is true. But, he is very passionate about econ and you can really tell. He throws in little jokes and stories to help make up for the tone of his voice. He explains things really well. I would definitely recommend him if you are deciding whether to take honors micro. He changes your perspective.", "His class seems pointless. Some of the assignments are confusing and he is not help at all :(", "He's belittling and rude because he knows what the hell he's talking about and you don't. Pay attention, take notes from what he says AND what's on the board. Ask questions if you don't understand something or want clarity.", "If you don't like Fred or any of his classes then there is clearly something wrong with you. This is the second time I've had him for a class and I have no complaints. Just do the work and you will get an easy A. Make sure you talk to him amount your assignments, ask him about anything so he will know you truly care, and be part of the East Texan.", "good easy going guy... realy boreing tho you will fall asleep!! A++", "I warn you - DON'T get on his bad side...otherwise you're ruined.", "Fisher was the funniest biology professor I've had. If you payed attention during lecture and read the chapters, the class was easy. Would take him second semester if I could.", "no text book needed. so you save $ whoo the only way to get a bad grade in this class is to not do work if you do the papers you get an A", "Professor Unno gives amazing lectures but at times they can be confusing or he gets off track. He has a clear grading criteria but is picky in how he wants things done. Overall he is a kind professor who genuinely cares about his students and what he is talking about. He is very knowledgeable and I would recommend him.", "FREE online text. Professor Damen is amazing, the content wasn't my favorite, but he is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about history. not unreasonable amount of papers. He wants everyone to succeed and will help you succeed. the tests are a little challenging, but studying is the key. useful audio and powerpoints. great class overall.", "Dr. Harding is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's intelligent, funny, and he cares about his students.", "How did an intro class change my life?", "Ah, he was a nice guy who is definitely passionate about the subject. Approachable. Content was challenging, which didn't mix that great with the marking system (40% midterm, 60% exam), but I walk away liking it. You know, he even said thanks once when I held the door open for him, which is more than I can say about other profs :P.", "A lot of passion for his topic", "I like Prof. Halpearn because if you wanted to get an A in the class, you could. I was border line an A, and he let me do a book review for bonus on a topic I was interested in that boosted me to an A. He didn't grade very hard, and since him a lot of professors I have had just grade by quizzes and tests so there is no extra credit.", "Dr. Burns is the best professor I've had at Texas Tech. He is very tough on you but once you graduate and you are in the real world, you will realize his class is of vital importance. His plethora of experiences (worked on Saturn V !!), professionalism, and knowledge of IT project management are all used in today's IT world.", "I heart Loparo.", "He really loves writing and gets really into talking about it and telling stories! A very interesting and great person to meet! The class is mostly discussion with some creative writing assignments all do at the end of the semester!Take this class if you are interested in learning alot about creative writing and what it means to you!", "He is the BEST professor ever!!! He is by far the best Sociology Professor. Love him. He is very flexible with his schedule. He always asks students if they need help with their essay questions.", "Still my favorite professor to date.", "The class is hard if you don't read!!!!! That's pretty much it, if you are interested in learning (which is why you should be in college) then you'll enjoy him. I also went to the Rome trip with him, same work load. He's worth the time and $$$.", "Good background, interesting speaker.", "Mr. Davis is highly recommended to those who take studying seriously and wish to excel.", "He gets confused doing his own problems he is virtually inaccessable and he is like late to his own classes", "Excellent teacher. Had him for Enviorn. Ethics. Very logical mind. Dry, yet funny sense of humor", "Never responded to emails and never explained himself. Was never available or helpful.", "good prof, helpful", "He's an awesome prof, as long as you go to class do the work you'll get an A. Most of all in class he even gives hints as to what questions will be on exams. Oh and you can e-mail him asking him questions and he'll help you, or take it up for the whole class. He's really good, i enjoyed his class.", "this guy was so cool it makes me wanna be an asian", "I hated this class. He was very fast-paced and not a good teacher. Grade was based on tests only... no homework, attendence or participation taken into consideration.", "He's an excellent prof, teaches really well, explains everything clearly and is very helpful if you go during his office hours. However, his exams are very tricky so you might want to get your concepts clear. Solve his past exams, make sure you really understand the solutions and you should be good.", "Patient and always provided extra information for those who were more interested in the science aspect. It was a great course.", "He is 7 feet of pure awesomeness. Definitely recommended & you will never stress about this class! He relates to the kids. No class on fridays, no final and he only takes off one point if you don't show up for class. But you do learn a lot if you do.", "Kwag's class is pretty difficult but he is such a helpful and kind professor. He is always willing to help students who actively seek help. He sets up after-class tutoring every single day so there is always help available. Exams are pretty tough and take a firm understanding of the material. Not too bad though, I got a 97 on the first one.", "i cannot recommend strongly enough against taking this class. mcauliffe makes no effort to analyze works objectively or put them in a historical context--feels more like a 6th grade religion class.", "Sharif was a great choice for fluids. He was very clear in grading criteria, explained things very well, and kept the class moving at a good pace. I took the class during the second summer term, but even though the class only lasted about a month, the work required to do well in the class was very manageable. I would recommend taking Sharif.", "I learned so much!", "Definitely my favorite professor I've ever had. The work is easy and everything is beyond interesting. He knows his history without a doubt! He was very open to discussion and opinions. He uses history books (like Ella Price's Journal) to guide his class. He explains things so clear. Take lots of notes. Absolutely LOVED this class!", "Love him. Easy tester and grader, nice guy, a little dry but you learn a lot and he really is devoted to his students.", "Dr. Baer was great1 I loved the choice he gave when it came to which type of exam you'd prefer to take. I'm also going to take his online class again this fall =)", "he's ok. i thought he was lazy. had us write a bunch of papers he'll not give back. BUT if you do the work and attend class, you'll be ok as i am sure i am getting my A. i think he is retiring after this spring semester.", "Professor Cameron is a really enthusiastic guy, he is so well learned and his lectures are never boring. He really knows his stuff. He is a really tough grader though, I would get a B+ on his exam and he told me I did extremely well.I don't consider a B+ an extremely good grade, but he does. Focus on the topics he emphasized, they'll n on the exam", "No Comments", "dowd was an amazing professor and is dearly missed by faculty and students. he's a legend. he was fun to listen to and knew his stuff. his tests aren't easy, but i enjoyed going to every class.", "Terrible prof! Worst class i've ever had, there was no point in attending class as he never talked about anything related to the course. Loses track of what he is saying and frequently has to read out of textbook or his notes. Refers too much to Toronto area where he went to school. Tests are b.s., noone ever knew what to study. Students beware.", "The hardest class I ever loved", "dr bob is the best proffessor i have ever met you have to take his class to believe he touched my heart, he does everything possible for you to pass the class he has extra credit and he is flexible. you will love his class", "Prof. Fox is interesting, challenging, helpful, understanding, and intelligent. I wish I could have taken more courses from him.", "To counter the prior comment, then I think if one shows up at lectures, reads the book, and actually takes time to understand the material, then one can do well. I ended up with a good grade. Prof. Englander is very knowledgeable and I recommend his course if you actually want to learn things. But, for a free ride, then this course is not the one.", "He is AMAZING. Maybe my favorite prof ever", "Let's be real here, people who rate professors poorly were probably poor students to being with. His classes are easily understood and you'll do just fine if you take notes and participate in class, like you should in any class. He's a nice guy and will answer your questions if you need help and hands out a guide at the start of class.", "He is NOT a good teacher. He helped write the text book that we used, and he LOVED talking about writing it. He did not teach at an intro level, and was not helpful when you had questions. I would NOT recommend him to ANYONE!!", "Well, he's not lining the bottom of the barrel, as some film profs are--(cough)Hendricks. However, he's tempermental and terribly unclear about what he wants. No effort is really required, so I'd recommend his class to 4:20- types.", "Doctor is the best. Intelligent and informative lectures. Put effort into the class and you'll do fine. Take him.", "No Comments", "Interesting. Brilliant. Caring. Amazing Professor. (and extremely hot).", "His CourseReader is useless. Most of the content is copied from the book. We have to buy it only for three coverpages. He also doesn't allow us use copies of his coverpage. May I ask, who wants to spend 30 bucks to buy only three coverpages!! So he is just a thoroughly profiteers.", "Knows his subject very well. Really cares about writing & literature. Very fair with grades.", "Lots of info, funny guy, can easily miss class and still catch up, webct rocks!!", "I agree w. most of the raters-Levine's an old school liberal, a wonderful man, and one of the most thoughtful professors I've come across at Bowdoin. Lectures can drag sometimes, but he's truly interested in his students' thoughts and is never a mean or spiteful grader. Take a class with him.", "Give yourself your own grade. Interesting method of grading but effective! Class was a round-table discussion and it is a definate break from the constant lectures. I highly recommend him!! Bring your cup of coffee and enjoy!", "This man is really hard to follow and his questions really have nothing to do with the subject. It is very easy to get a good grade but if you actually want to learn something I would not recommend this class.", "Boring teacher but he is very passionate about the class. Doesn't remember students names. Don't buy the text book because we don't use it at all. Tests are difficult and basically all memorization. If you study a lot you will be okay.", "If you have taken calc in highschool, the class can still be hard but not unbearable. Do the homework and take your time on the quizes, they can be tricky. His teaching methods are good though, he gives you the fishing pole instead of the fish.", "I personally cannot stand Peters. I had him for 5 classes because of my minor. He is very intelligent, and knows his stuff, however his grading standards are ridiculous and as a person he's a little arrogant.", "Mind-blowing show up and pass class.", "Hamlet was the worst English teacher I have ever had. He is arrogant, pompous and full of himself. He assigns prompts that are purposely ambiguous so he can lord it over you when you do poorly. (Hs writing indicates this) If you can regurgitate what he says, nod and swoon a lot then you'll do fine.", "Dr. Peters is a fabulous professor. Anyone that can make calculus understandable deserves a gold star. He has a lot of enthusiam for the subject matter. He is a very nice person and always willing to help if needed. Clearly, this is a very intelligent man. I love Dr. Peters!!!", "honestly, he is a terrible teacher and does not teach you a darn thing! His class is full of nonsense and his tests are just full of ridiculous questions that he like pulled out of nowhere. He really needs to learn how to teach!", "very helpful, I was not even supposed to be advised by him, just showed up for some help, and he was available. above and beyond. some wish to complain about hard work and too many classes, but they are pre-med??! If you cannot take 5 hard undergrad courses at once, you will not survive med school", "Unrealistic!! Avoid him!! He is so struck on himself that he does not lecture on important material. He likes hearing himself talk. He is interesting but a joke too.", "Such an insightful, hilarious man! At first I was put off my his mumbling ways, but trust me, once you get to know him, all his interests, manners, tastes, asides, and honest skill as a professor become entirely endearing. Helped me to look at poetry in a new way.", "ok so this class is by far the worst class in sociology i have taken, as a matter of fact, the worst ever lectures are so boring and his teaching is so unorganized the reader and his handouts were complicated to find nothing was in order and it was simply just not enjoyable i hope he hasnt been teaching it this way all this time. finally it's over!", "he is the devil incarnate....i hate him a lot and a lot....he ruined my grade for biology and my future....with a normal lab professor i would have gotten 40% of lab....its a miracle that hes retiring...i only wish he did it sooner", "Dr. E is a super nice guy, but I don't think he should be teaching lower level chem. He just assumes that we already know what he's talking about, so he doesn't explain anything. Tests are all short answer, which is actually beneficial because you can somewhat BS.", "He only seems like a very scary man, as long as you attend lectures and make notes in your book his classes are a breeze. A great Prof once you get through his first year class", "This is ridiculous. He has no clue how to teach this class because all he does is lecture and you're expected to catch on EVERY ****ING MINUTE DETAIL.", "Dr. Roter goes through material so fast your hands will be on fire. Sometimes he doesn't go through the terms we need to know and expects us to know when the test comes up. His matching section in tests are vague so the only way is to take a guess. Unreasonable when the answer I gave was correct but wanted something else deduct it.", "the best sports science teacher", "YOU HAVE TO READ YOUR TEXTBOOK. YOU HAVE TO STUDY. Fern does as good a job teaching as anyone could do in the limited class time ther is. Take FULL ADVANTAGE of the cheatsheet that is allowed for the tests by typing in size 6 font with formulas and examples and it is CRITICAL to your grade that you ATTEMPT ALL problems of the HW, right or wrong!", "The class kind of drags on a bit. The professor covers most everything on the test in class, but you will have to study for his test. Do all the assigined work and study guides.", "Awesome guy a little slow grader but impossible to do bad i skipped a quiz and still got a 91", "Good professor, pay attention to the terms and phrases covered in class (some in Japanese) because they'll be on the test! Very helpful and personable.", "No Comments", "Professor Arminio is awesome. He explains topics very well, has flexible office hours for extra help, announces exams well in advance, and loves to give pop quizzes. These quizzes aren't really pop though, as he always says to expect one soon. Arminio, also, gives great advice about future schools to apply to.

He's a hoot!", "No Comments", "He doesn't know how to teach outside of engineering. Basic/Simple physics became extremely complex. He changes units at least 3-4 times a problem on tests and goes between metric and US units often. it's confusing.", "The accent is the worst part, he's very hard to understand. But the class overall is easy to pass with little effort. Attendance isn't mandatory but homework is due every class. He reviews the class before the test and it's a great indication of what to expect on the tests. His tests are multiple choice and easy to do well on. Textbook used for HW", "the course is easy. he is not great he nit picks at little thing don't get on his bad side other then that he is fine. nothing special. notes are all over the pace just read the text do his assignments", "brewbaker can brew some thoughts!", "Dr. Nutter was my advisor on my senior project. He was not very helpful and not very clear. He is a fairly nice person, though.", "seriously, nice guy, helpfull, just read the book(!), gives extra credit points oportunity throughout the semester,overall an easy class, just the usual guidelines, plus powerpoints are on line, but remember to read the book. Do NOT understand what the others commentators rated him low!", "I took his class in 6 weeks and got an A! His class is easy and he is a really nice prof! I would take his class again just for fun. I had two tests and 1 final- T/F are tricky, essay is easy, and fill in blanks are easy. One of the easiest class I have taken at PCC. Only thing i didn't like was the boring videos we watched in class. Take him!!!", "A great guy. Loves what he does, the lectures are interesting, and he adds humor to keep us from falling asleep. His accent adds to the class, and those who say they can't understand him are sheltered and need a hearing aid. His exams and papers are fair and helpful.", "as a professor he does his bes, but the problem is that many liberal art students must take this course to fulfill research requirements but aren't interested in it. tests aren't bad. i like his jokes, feels like in good old commedy show.", "This guy, not even sure where to start. He's smart and sometimes funny, but is unclear and gives difficult assignments. Doesn't clarify what he wants; would rather you figure it out for yourself. Grills students. I took him as a freshmen first semester and regret it. Final=disastrous. Unless you enjoy a challenge, choose a different teacher.", "it's a good thing FYS 114/3 is no longer being offered because it was awful! He was so unclear and never taught. It was like he didn't even care. He worked with a professor that he hated.", "makes a point to get to know students!", "Hands down worst math teacher i have EVER had. Argued with students. Condescending and bizarre. There were four huge 'quizzes' which more resembled a midterms. no review of material. hwk assignments and class examples do not match quiz/final questions. V RUDE MAN STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS. DROP IT. REPEAT AVOID GLENNON.", "Nice guy, but I took an astronomy course for Arts students... Expected us to know all these complicated physics related things. I suppose it would have been fine, but I was more interested in looking at stars than learning the equations for the doppler effect and stuff.", "Who hired this guy?! Worst class I have EVER taken.Long tests,dry, illogical lectures,he makes up words,very hard 2 follow.He also changes what he says as if that's what he said all along-including when assignments r due.Wants u 2 memorize,not learn.Got an A but it was TORTURE!", "The tests on his class is in class had writing a paper about one question that he randomly choose from two questions he gave us earlier. I just can't understand why would anybody test student like that. Why don't him just let us write the paper and turn in like a regular professor.", "He is a good prof. but BIG on APA format. You will have journal entries but can email him to look over b4 handing in. Overall interesting class.", "IT IS MIND-BLOWING HOW BRILLIANT THIS MAN IS. Knows so much about the world. Class is easy. Weekly quizzes (10 multiple choice) and a final project (either website or blog). The best professor at MHC and I don't even like politics!!! But this class was awesome!!", "extremely intelligent", "This is one of the best professors I have had at this school.

Dr. Harding offers students the opportunity to revise papers, gives students incredible feedback, and makes his class very interactive.", "He's the absolute worse. Would not recommend taking.

If you have the option to take him, DON'T", "terrible prof", "4 exams throughout the quarter w/ the lowest score dropped then a final exam. Weight was 50/50 between the 3 exams and final if the average of the 3 was higher than the final. If the final exam grade was higher than the 3 then its 20% for the 3 exams and 80% for the final. I walked into the final with a 73% average. Got an A- in the class.", "Professor Sterner is he best! he is the nicest man I have ever met.

Excellent pictures, Good use of pointers(lazers), Always willing to answer questions,He says no to copy his note off the board, **whisper** \"Copy everything, is helpful with assignments and keep you paying attention\".

He made what could have been a difficult class fun.", "His books were definetly not mediocre-- Story of a Million Years is breathtaking and The Wolf Girl is really bizzare and fascinating, and plenty of literary critics agreed. I didn't love UVM and transferred out, but just talking to him made school more palatable for me while I was there. I'd take another class with him if I was still there...", "Great class! I took it a year ago and loved it. Centeno is a really nice guy. The class text book is Pop Culture. We wrote essays on movies, advertising, etc. Loved it!

Had him before and now I have him again. 2 Sweet!!", "He is an amazing professor with great people skills.

I also took WL 100 and was enjoyed it a lot, might major in WL!", "Great teacher. Smart and passionate. Breaks down theories+readings clearly and concisely. Workload seems heavy at first but do-able. His class is worth taking. Would definitely take him again. Also helps that he's easy on the eyes...I sure paid attention!", "Dr. Baker is a nice person. I did not like this class however due to being graded by few things. Some of which these things were out of the student's control. For instance, the egg drop or glider project either worked or it didn't work and your grade depended on it. We didn't know our egg was going to break and our grade suffered. No tests.", "LOL, all the bad comments came from FROSH taking Bus 111. I took 2 classes with Tim, it's not easy, but I learned and survived. I graduated and appreciate him very much now.

The last homework of every set gives you less than 12 hours to complete. Basically forces all-nighters. Can't find HW answers online, in text book, or from lecture content. Expects you to remember everything from stats and know excel.", "Dr. Rorke is by far the best professor I have had at OU. His enthusiasm and passion for his work is beyond words. I learned more from this class than any other course at Oakland. Tough teacher but, rarely boring or difficult to remain attentive in class.

Learned alot.", "Jim is a really good professor , hes clear and takes the extra time to help you. He hates when people are late and or miss alot of class. As long as you really make an effort hell teach you as much as you want to learn. Perspective drawing was tough and very precision heavy. Better if youve taken drawing 1 beforehand", "interesting professor. lectures are boring, movies are alright. go to class because he does take attendance when he sees a lot of empty seats. exams are either multiple choice or essays which he gives you the questions beforehand.", "he is the worst teacher possible. no matter what you do you can please him, he will not help and if you ask questions he talks to you like your dumb. when he grades he does not make sense. and when he teaches its like reading off a teleprompter. i have never seen him be nice or fai.", "Great history professor and always prepared for class. Easy to talk to and is willing to help if you need it.

Any time you visit it seems like he is inconvenienced. Along with that he couldn't even explain how to add a minor/certificate. Had no interest except to push for 12 credit hours (no faith in students' abilities). He should be thankful for tenure.", "No Comments", "dont believe ppl who say hes 2 hard he doesn't care he drinks the blood of babies blah blah blah hes cool n stuff", "unbelievably knowledgable, easy to talk to, i had a wonderful experience in his class. voice is funny, but he's great to talk to. i also took his trip to Greece and he was a fabulous leader for 13 students in a foreign country.", "He pretty much expects you to go to class, as he often covers important concepts at the beginning of class which he \"forgets\" to record. His test questions are written in a very convoluted way, which makes his test questions harder. His explanations in class are often garbage so you will need often learn things on your own outside of class.", "I learned absolutely nothing in this class that I couldn't figure out on my own with common sense. The class was a waste of time, but it made for an easy A. And Grossman, although not helpful at all, is really nice. Get on his good side and he'll let you get away with anything. His project is extreamly easy and his tests are a breeze.", "he is very nice and anything from an 80%-100% is an A", "This class was horrible. I would not recommend it to anyone.", "Awesome Teacher", "Really bad at grading tests. Questions are usually all-or-nothing, so while it might help you once in a blue moon if you show your work, chances are you won't get any of the points for a question you get wrong anyways.", "Yes evil, the worst teacher has no respect for the student. if he is angry he just leave the class and do not return, then spend next class yelling at us instead of helping us, swear a lot, mark up our works, very cocky, think he is the best, waste of $$", "Prof. Smith has to be one of the best instuctors/mentors in the world.

Mr. Potter did not waste my time and his process works.", "good teacher. you can easily pass your course with good grade", "Super easy teacher. I have him right now and got 95 on test and A's on all quizs.", "Haha, hotness level - zero. Prof. Irvine was definatly one of my influences to continue my major in history. I agree with alot of what was already written... he keeps the attention focused during lecture, keeps a fast pace, speaks with alot of tone and inflection, and tries to make jokes here and there. I loved the way he pronounced 'R-r-russians'.", "He doesn't teach, he only gives tests based on reading. Then talks for an hour every class. He is not helpful at all, and doesn't respond to e-mails when you have questions.", "The lectures are fairly boring to someone who isn't interested in physics. Attendance is required because of the iClickers as a part of your grade. Tests are challenging but he curves generously. HW is assigned often and there are online quizzes. English is not his strength, but it's fine. The class is not overly difficult and is manageable.", "Just brilliant.", "Dr. Parker is extremely reliable and he genuinely cares about his students and will put your priorities in front of his own.

You can tell he loves teaching anatomy. Don't be late to class or he will make fun of you. His tests are straight forward. Make sure to study the study guides he gives for each exam. You will get an idea of how he words his tests.", "ok teacher", "I liked Lecker. His lectures were very interesting and depending on your TA, the conferences can really help clarify things if need. He has really insightful things to say about what we read, he's very knowledgeable about the content&the authors and encourages people to give their own ideas in class. Have the readings done before class, its a must!", "He can be a bit intimidating, but I find once you take the time and show him that you are actually making his time worth the effort, he will treat you fine. He doesn't want to waste his time with students who don't do anything in the class. Chem isn't easy, he knows it and proves it everyday.", "I had him for Molecular Evolution (Bioinformatics), and I have to say, I was impressed. He spoke about Genetics and Evolution with the greatest of ease - pretty good for a CS Professor. Excellent Professor.", "TOO MUCH INFORMATION! Overwhelms students with the amount of information and do not give out any lecture notes! Lectures have some organization but for the most part are all over the place! He is very intrested in the subject and gets excited when he lectures which causes him to talk FAST while he's lecturing.", "This guy is too deep for any sort of character based review. He dosen't care about your submissions,just submit the work on time and you'll get an A. He's seriously like a hype man for his own material. All of the course material is authored by him, and he even comes equipped with his own Wikipedia page. You won't learn much other than his resume.", "The Man of the hour! Pleasure to have this teacher. I was on the soccer team I missed a few times and still passed with a B. You can write about what evers in the essays. He likes for you to use samples from the book. Very easy and flexible on the hours. Emails right back and overall the one to take HONESTLY!! Plus makes class a bit fun.", "Very helpful and nice, especially at HW help sessions and office hours. If you're into physics and you have a solid background, definately take it from him and not in the big lecture class. It is hard material - but he makes it interesting.", "Always pronounced my name wrong... oh well. If I hadn't taken Phsyics in HS, the class would be super confusing - he needs a new teaching method. If you already had Physics, take this class and it'll be easy. If you haven't, take someone native to the US.", "His lecture's aren't terrible so long as someone answers his open ended questions, he'll just stand there until someone does. He's helpful if you have questions but he's a bit odd. The grading isn't bad but the Journal Questions really add up so stay on top of the assignments.", "Dedicate at least a day to doing problems per chapter. The exams aren't too difficult, but they are tricky so you need to know your stuff. He's a good prof, practice the problems he posts at the end of lectures and you'll pass. Go to tutorials for extra practice questions and you'll get at least a B. I stress, go to tutorials if you can.", "It would be a major big mistake for anyone who is enrolled in this poor excuse for a professor. He quietly mumbles speedily his lectures as if talking to himself to take up time. Unorganized powerpoint slides. His lectures are like impromptu.", "Theatrical, entertaining style, but is not open to real discussion of views that counter his John Birch-like constitutional theories. I have to read outside class to learn real constituation law.", "Ok class - he often made jokes no one would get.

I wouldn't miss his class ever. I like his stories. He knows so much about east asia... I highly recommend this class...", "Ted is definitely a great teacher. Truly intelligent and influential in the communication field. Sometimes name drops. I had a really bad TA so it made the experience difficult. However, class was thought provoking and reading-intensive.", "Cant argue with a class where watching tv is given as home work. makes u think more which could be good and bad.", "Loparo is a great guy and a great professor. He talks and writes clearly and tells you what you need to know. Easily one of the best professors at CWRU. Tests and projects are difficult but he does curve the class. Oh yeah, he gives extra credit for the Browns winning and for going to class!!!!!!!", "He's tough, but he knows his stuff. But you need to let him know if you're struggling. If you don't, you're gonna fall behind. Tough grader, if you have one blemish on a chord identification, that's 5 points off of the quiz, it adds up. Study, and you'll make it.", "The best teacher at UVM. Hands down.", "Wandling is extrememly confusing and frustrating. He doesn't use a powerpoint for most of his lectures which makes it difficult to understand what exactly you need to know for the exams. You get your grades through the TA's, not him. There is a lot of reading for each class, and is difficult to understand at the beginning of the semester.", "Great Professor. Info was clear, in order and insightful. Very easy to learn from. Gives several difficult multiple-choice quizes and drops lowest so you get several chances instead of everything riding on midterm and final. Really nice guy.", "He was nothing but a bully, disguised as a teacher. Yelling and taunting kids were his main teaching methods. If you can switch out of his class.", "My favorite class of the semester! Dr. Borders is hilarious, insightful, and a talented professor. He is very straightforward and doesn't take crap from anyone, and his tests are a little difficult. I loved this class so much that I was truly disappointed when I overslept once.", "very easy A. hes not to good of a teacher, but if youre looking for an easy A, that is the teacher for you.", "good teacher, clear and and if you work hard you'll get the material. ture that he's kid of weird but lets face it, no one's perfect. gives 4 quiz that counts for 50% of over all grade and drops the lowest of the 4 so the top three best would be counted.", "Mr. Briggs is down to earth, entertaining, very knowledgable and made me care about a course that was originally just to satisfy a requirement.", "Do not take him.", "Maybe a little scary at times, but he really is helpful and a nice guy when it comes down to it.", "He really is a good prof. Wants to see his students succeed (unlike a lot of other profs at York). Highly recommend him. He's very flexible and very reasonable. As long as you do the questions assigned you'll do great. Theres no surprises. Two thumbs up!!", "He knows psychology but he is VERY scattered and unhelpful. I dont know what happened between the good reviews and now but he does not like us asking questions, he gets off topic ALL the time. Most of us bought the book from the bookstore and they have the 12th edition. He is still on the 11th and doesnt care that the chapters are very different.", "He's engaging, his lectures are great. I enjoyed his class and the way he teaches.", "EASY class. I'd reccomend it though,no class on friday. Definitely good to not have to walk to begley three days a week. He is really easy going, super easy class. He takes two classes before each test to review EVERYTHING that is gonna be on the test, I cannot stress how easy this class is, I'd recommend him, you will learn a little bit", "I like him, jolly fellow. But he does run through things a tad quickly. The class itself is hard. You cannot half ass this course. STUDY.", "THE CLASS IS NOT HARD, HOWEVER WHETHER YOU PARTICIPATE OR NOT, IT DOESN'T COUNT. YOU DONT NEED 2 BUY THE BOOK TO PASS.", "Dr. Wolf is the bomb. He just says stuff to see if he can get a rise out of students and open their minds uto alternate ways of thinking", "No Comments", "The lectures are long, boring, and filled with information that you don't need/want to know. But attendance is mandatory. He gives 6 \"grades' for the semester but his grading scale makes no sense. Doesn't use email/blackboard at all. In a 55 minute lecture that ended 5 minutes early I kept a tally for every time he said um. It ended up being 453.", "Horrible teacher, pointless class, did a 20 page paper on my emotions.... Literally the worst teachers i have ever had.", "He is enthusiastic and loud. He doesnt like late people and you better have your book with you at every class. Too much work in the class for a GE credit. Too many written essay assignments and quizes. The tests are the same as the pre-tests, and then change later.", "CREATIVE WRITTING WAS THE EASIEST AND BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT ALBRIGHT", "He's an all right teacher. His diagrams are really helpful and if you have a question he does his best to answer it. The only problem is that he doesn't give out any handouts. He expects you to read the entire textbook.", "Dr. Preston is without a doubt the best prof at UVic. He is extremely well-versed in his subject matter and can incorporate contemporary issues into any subject matter. TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM, he is probably the only prof worth your tuition!", "No Comments", "He is an amazing professor, his tests aren't hard AT ALL, he does have web assignments due every week, but they're easy.

It is alot of hard work, but so very interesting. Lots of thinking involved. I remember some in the class would leave completely exhausted from thinking too much, wanting to bang their head on the wall. You either love it, or you hate it.

In my top 3 of favorite teachers at Southeast!", "Just dont do it....most of his class failed his test...highest grade was a C just drop it or take another teacher!", "sweetest man ever!! take him if at all possible, one of the best people ever", "Hands down the most serious and hardworking profs around. He's a machine, smart as a whip; BUT, gives off the distinct sense of a man learning with you. Young, hip, complex; a keen eye for nuance, and smart enough to show you: history has motives. GB", "horrible! i did not like this prof, horta, but course was neat.", "Gives lectures mostly on concepts and theory with very few example problems and expects you to learn how to do most problems on your own. He does clicker questions for a grade every class. I would not recommend him to anyone who does not have a strong chemistry background. He also gives no equation sheets for exams.", "No Comments", "Very difficult class. Robert Coleman enjoys putting students on the spotlight and will keep pressuring you to speak even when you have no idea what to say. Try to speak as little as possible in the class. Do NOT raise your hand. You have to read about 100 pages of online or textbook material for each class or else he WILL put you on the spot.", "If you're majoring in Accouting at Case, you won't be able to avoid Pearson. He's a great professor. It's a shame there aren't more like him. Gives way too much homework.", "He really knows what hes talking about but he isn't the best teacher. Lectures are very monotone and the only grades are exams and 2 homework's a month. He doesn't tell you about any deadlines, you are just expected to know when the tests are and when the homework's are due. His class does not co-inside with the lab at all!!", "After I read these reviews I didn't want to like this class. But one smile at me the first day and he got me. Yeah, he knows he's a campus Rock Star. But it only adds to his charm. The man just loves his job. Never in a bad mood. Passionate and brilliant. Every class is a show. And you'll learn alot. Sit in front for the best view. :)", "No Comments", "Very helpful, insightful, and capable of applying economic theory to a multitude of markets and arenas.", "By far the worst teacher at UA. AVOID", "I thought that taking an Asian religions course would be semi interesting, but Professor Unno made this class a pain to go to. I couldnt really understand what he was saying because he says everything in a philosophical sort of way and didnt really get straight to the point. Make sure you do all of the readings!!", "Warning: By far the worst online teacher no communication skills, no desire to help", "One of the best professors ever! I took the class over Summer and wished it was a 10 week class. He has a great presence about him that makes you want to pay attention and be present for every class. As for the workload, it's adequately planned for the length of class time. Three quizzes, response paper and group proj. Take his class!", "He picks favorites and if you're not on his good side, or you don't agree with his ideas, he makes you pay. I have never had an issue with a professor but he is AWFUL. Trust me, stay away!", "David is a really nice guy and does want you to do well.

Lectures jump from topic to topic, it's hard to follow his train of thought.

I had him for precal and will take him all of myh maths if I can", "Ive taken Fogel twice-- you gotta love him. He'll get so excited about lines or words in poems and tell us his theory about them that will take up a third of the class. Always makes jokes about having read things over and over for 30 years. Come up with an interesting new idea about a poem or book and if he gets it in any way he'll appreciate it.", "Mark is a great teacher. He spells all the material out with crystal clarity and can answer any question. That being said, he's so brilliant that it was really hard for those of us that are only so good at Calc to keep up and understand the material. Calc II wasn't like a normal Calc course, it was intense. I spent a lot of time prepping for exams.", "Nice guy, always there for help if you need it.", "Panzeralla is focused on his own text books that he has compiled. He has no time for students, nor helping them. I have no idea why he is teaching at all when he has no interest in helping students at all.

This class is friendly to science and humanities students, it's creative and thought provoking if you go in with the right mind.", "This class involves A LOT of reading. In class you grade yourself on how well you prepared for that day. You actually do that quite often. His grading scale is not the regular scale - a 94% is an A- and a 91% is a B+.

Wish I did my PhD with him instead!", "Hey pal, I have a hint for ya: Don't bring theology into the mix when you are teaching philosophy. Also, the end of the class should be reserved for question time, not personal crisis time. I don't recommend this teacher to anyone.", "I took this class on line this summer. Dr. Coleman was extreemly helpful and quick with getting back to me with any questions. I struggled a bit at the beginning but he kept with me and was encouraging through the course. I wound up getting an A. I would highly recommend him.", "DO NOT take his class, unless you want to rip your hair out for an hour and 15 min. He is so delirious.

However, his conducting leaves more to be desired!", "Coleman is challenging. Students basically argue for a whole 2.40 hours. Other will say that he is not worth putting up with. He does come off as belittling, so if you are up for a challenge, take this class. If not, avoid it because you will be put on the spot. Other than that, he has a lot to say and numerous interesting, heart wrenching stories.", "Dr. Harvey was a fantastic professor; passionate about the subject matter, often made jokes which lightened up the fact that it was a longer class, and was friendly when approached with questions. Great class, great teacher. Hard material, but strongly recommend to Political Science majorsminors! Also, he posts all the readings online to save $$!", "Professor Fair is the best teacher that I've ever had. He makes it clear from day 1 that he is available to help his students.

He is GENIUS.", "Favorite professor of the semester. very cool. very hard and sometimes hard to follow, but overall great.", "Dr. Brooks is an amazing teacher.

But when it came time for choosing my second semester chem class, and the only available time with Dr. K was 8:30 again, I gladly signed up to have him as the professor!", "Don't listen to the slackers. If you enjoy CJ and actually want to learn something novel and challenging and DIFFERENT, take his classes. He can be challenging, but he helps you and doesn't attack you like other professors. His classes usually mean a lot of reading and discussion, but it's well worth it. Also, his graduate classes are ROCKING.", "Boring, but a good teacher", "He's ridiculously vague and biased. There is no point in arguing with him. If you disagree with him, you're wrong.

LISTEN to his advice and DO the HW.", "No Comments", "Comm Law is probably one of the toughest non-science classes at AU. It was hard, but enjoyable.

I hope he teaches more classes in the future!!", "Great professor. He really cares about his class, and works very hard at adjusting it according to student feedback. Ignore comments about previous years, because it's changed since them. It's not an easy class, but he's devoted to helping you understand the material.", "Easiest Professor IN THE WORLD. Purhapse TOO EASY. TOO CLASS ONLINE. Textbook is a MUST. READ SHORT Passages, anwers questions. ITS THAT EASY. NO MID TERMS!!!! NO FINALS. FALL 2012", "Amazing guy. Class is fairly easy and he is extremely nice and knowledgeable. Take him at every chance you have!", "Craig is an awesome teacher! You can really tell he is passionate about what he teaches. Also the class is a bit hard (10+ exams) but there is so much extra credit you can still pass with a good grade. You also do go outside a lot but it's a lot of fun! This was my Favorite class & professor and I wish I could take it again.", "Honestly people... his accent is hot, yes, but he's just an average guy. Besides he's married! His three hour classes seem to drag... not like it matters much though he's not going to be here after this semester... he's going back to his island abode.", "Took Steve multiple times during my masters. You get from him as much as you want. If you are on the lazy side-don't take him. If you want to be pushed and are open to new ideas-he's your guy.", "great professor.", "GREAT CLASS. very nice lovable guy with a booming voice like james earl jones'.he makes the subject very fun. a midterm/final/oral presentation/paper. very helpful to his students. MUST TAKE!", "he's not horrible... the course itself is pretty interesting. study. its hard to pull an A off in this class, but if you're good at science/math you'll be fine. he's really nice otherwise.", "I'm the 100th! Hands down to the best professor I've ever had. Hope he's enjoying his retired life! I miss you Vinnie!", "Took biology 1 and 2 in 1999. I can say he had one of the classes that I learned a lot from. Taught a short creationism section along with everything. Was unique in that regard.", "Very easy class as long as you show up! Reimer is a nice guy and explains everything well. EASY A!!!", "No Comments", "Good professor. Not the best teacher, but he keeps the class is plenty entertaining and fairly easy.", "nice guys AWFUL teacher. just writes unintelligible graphs on the board and expects you to know what he is talking about. didn't even use the book at all. only has tests and a 5% quiz and a 35% cumulative final. this guy is way too smart to teach people who aren't econ geniuses. would take a different professor.", "Knows his stuff, and expects you too as well. He called out some kid in class because the kid made a dumb comment. I like that. Lots of reading. Tests are hard. Going to class is essential. Don't use pencils.", "Dr. Hadley can be downright mean. He once called our entire class idiots. In short, I did not enjoy being in his class, although I did well.", "Arlan is probably the greates prof ever. Super funny, super enthusiastic, you learn alot while having fun. Super smart guy who wants you to do well. Take his class over anyone!", "Poor! VERY poor!", "Dr. Nelson is funny, passionate about botany, & makes class interesting! Take field trips each week followed by a field quiz. EVERYTHING is cumulative, so Dr. N expects you to keep up with knowing the plants and botany terminology. As long as you study frequently, you will receive a good, fair grade. My favorite professor & class I've ever taken!!!", "Honestly i thought Dwayne Rurka was the best professor i have even encountered at N.A.I.T.. The lectures were interesting, he made sure the students were included in the arguments and he kept us on out toes. i really took in what he taught from his classes and have new respect for other perspectives. So i want to say thank you.", "Talks more than teaches", "Very clear and great in lecture. He grades his tests tough but if you know the notes and do all of the practice problems they aren't that bad.", "At the lower levels, Form and Space, JC was confusing and frustrating to have as a teacher. However, I found him to be a great guy and an even better professor when he is teaching a smaller and more advanced class. Although boring at times, he teaches technical aspects to sculpture that cannot be matched. If you do the work, you will be rewarded", "Very big ego. If you patronize him and stroke his pride you will do well. Make him look good at the ASHRAE competition and he will help you. If you challenge him he will lose his temper and his ears turn red. Smart but totally vain.", "I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S TEACHIGN BIO! HE SHOULD BE TEACH SOME KIND OF MENTAL CLASS!!!", "No Comments", "A Very Wise Man!!!!!!!!!!", "His lectures put me to sleep. He needs to be a little bit more exciting ...", "Amazing and funny teacher. Take great note during class and listen what he go over in the review and it lay you an easy A on his final and midterm, and he will curve if nobody did not make an 100.", "No Comments", "Dr. Neal is a great teacher! He gives a lot of homework, and does let you out late, but he is always willing to help. He is very enthusiastic about what he does, and is just such an awesome and funny person.", "Everything Professor Zoccolillo says is admirable. One of my favorites is, \"It's about living in a world where our lives and our assumptions about each other intersect, and yes, crash, and how we live and love and hurt and hate each other--and ourselves.\"", "very hard teacher hard to pass most you can get is B exams are very difficult.", "I have no idea why math teachers keep getting more and more ridiculous, this professor is very hard to understand and at random points during his lecture runs of in tangents about other things. He is fast paced and due to the difficult, dragging lectures [which i left feeling stupider if anything] i reluctantly decided to p/nc theclass:( not happy!", "very hard marker, but you will learn alot, excellent teacher!", "Online class. Contact with him sort of fizzeled throughout the semester; basically he never answered his e-mails. Easy class. Only asked for quizzes, 4 essays and discussion postings. No final.", "He is an AWESOME teacher. His class was a prerequisite to classes I really wanted to take. He made the class fun. He really is a good teacher.", "He is very knowledgeable in this subject, however he has a hard time passing that on to his students. I am currently sitting in this class completely lost :(", "Really good guy who is interested in his subject. Very discussion-based, so you need to read the book.", "Although this class is extremely tough, Prof. Ruhi works hard to teach his students well. His grading is very fair and he always responds to emails promptly, even on the weekends. As long as you attend lectures, you can do well in the course.", "There weren't many actual lecture,since 80% of the class were presentations held by students. The grading criteria was very unclear, although he usually gave good grades. But be aware, all assignments were group projects with the same group throughout the semester.", "Absolute worst professor I've ever had. Gives URI a bad name. We took a midterm on Oct. 25 and didn't get it back until December 4th. Sure, he tells entertaining stories, but he really has no interest in his students. His lectures are to hear himself speak. A total of 20 students show up and he doesn't seem to care.", "Went to MIT and knows his stuff. He's a goofy little guy that you shouldn't take too seriously. A great and fun prof if you just get to know him. Definately go to office hours and he'll help you out, but you may get stuck watching youtube videos with him. Class is hard, but really just put a full day's worth of study in b4 the exam and youll b fine", "I have to agree with the others; it was the easiest A that I ever made but if you want to really know the material then you are out of luck. He is the only one who teaches the Forensic Accounting class.", "Hot professor, went to Yale and he is a lawyer. Would definitely take and yes even if he talks that kean is the worst, it is true", "Dibble is a little weird and starts going off on tangents, a lot! but when it comes to getting an easy A or B you can't beat Dibble just put your political views off to the side in his class.", "He is someone who I'd call an intellectual. I could just sit down and listen to him talk about things he's passionate about. Very smart, funny, and gives great lectures. If you turn in a paper he marks grammatical errors and work cited mistakes. take good notes and refer to the book. You have to work for your grade but he makes it very enjoyable.", "Absolutely hysterical. I was in stitches every morning. Incredibly intelligent - his mind is always working. Nothing gets past him! Where is he now??? Would love to take another class with him.", "monotone voice, hard three quizzes, two exams, one final but easy projects. weights assignments (ie quizzes 15%, final 20%). he's smart, hard and knows his stuff so if you want to learn take him but if you want it isn't don't.", "Pavlic is a little bit eccentric, but he a real intellectual. He expects as much genuine interest in learning and writing about the material as he puts into teaching it. Which is to say a lot. If students put in the time to read everyhting and pay attention in class, the rewards are worth the effort.", "UNCLEAR, UNSTRUCTURED, horrible professor. Very intelligent, but unable to express ideas to students.", "Rose is sweet and an awsome teacher. He cares about the success of his students. I was nervous about this class since i took it in the summer. My doubts were unnecessary. though the class was hard i learned alot and managed a B. I would recomend him in a heartbeat", "Never actually explains what he wants. He will fail your assignments and not give clear feedback as to what he actually expects from you. Quiz, 2 journals, and groupwork due each week. Rude and extremely unhelpful.", "this guy is great!!! great sense of humor in a class that should have an \"intro to l & c\" class. the reading is very very difficult, but there are certain fundamentals that the good doctor wants you to pick up. if you can grasp that concept, and make sure he gets the study guide to you, then you will have a good time. will take again.", "If you are looking for an easy A do not take him. He is a great teacher, he knows what he is talking about. If you go above and beyond on the world he gives you, he rewards you with bonus points. I would recommend him but not if you are looking for a easy grade.", "No Comments", "The thing is, he does not grade fairly; he's not a fan of partial credit. I'm not shocked anymore to see 0/5 or 0/10 on questions where I clearly have a half-decent grasp on it. He is very picky and uncompromising. I seriously had the feeling that he often didn't want me to do well. With any other prof, that B would definitely be a solid A.", "This class was really hard to stay awake in, but it was an easy A. All you have to do is read the book!!! Go to class because you get participation EVERYDAY!! Won't give you an excused absence unless you are at a UNIVERSITY EVENT!!!! If you like to sleep during class this is one that you can!!!", "Peters is a really great professor. This is the 3rd or 4th class I've taken with him, and he always has very clear grading criteria, clear explanations during class, and a real passion for what he does. He's extremely knowledgeable, but if he doesn't know the answer to a question you have, he'll take time to find it for you. Excellent guy!", "Brilliant.", "I had no previous exposure to sociology. Prof. Tim McCauley made it very interesting; I always enjoyed these lectures so much so that I switched into sociology! Overall, very easy course and exams. Check out his website www.yorku.ca/timm/ for he might have the breakdown of the course your looking into (which is always helpful).", "Brilliant, has a sense of humor, you get exactly what you put into it. Work hard and it'll be one of the best classes you'll take.", "He's a very nice and lenient Professor. He does tend to go off topic during lectures. Unfortunately we didn't get to finish all the chapts and topics during my Fall 14' semester. Honestly I just think he's getting old but he's not a BAD Professor. Although he only took attendance SOMEtimes it's best to show up to know what will be on tests. No Hw.", "I was in his studio a few years back and I love him.", "the advisors are investigating him -- nice guy, but ridiculously hard class.never missed a lecture,or lab,completed all of the reading and still failed. I had close to a 4.0 before I took his class. the tests were impossible,and definitely not anything that was covered in the book or lecture.", "Professor Rooney never missed one class meeting throughout the semester. You must get the book for class. The semester in all was 2 quizzes, midterm and a final and extra credit was available. No homework. Everything for the tests are in his lecture don't miss his class if you want an A. I missed 4-5 classes and was able to get a B. Good class!", "Funny guy, he sort of says that whole \"ehhhh not quite thing alot\" but if you pay attention you will learn a lot from him. He is a fair grader too", "I took this course last year and it changed my life, because he sort of became my mentor, and I'm just one of many mentees. It's easy to do well in his courses, but seriously if you show him effort it will be the best decision you ever make. Fun, funny, chill, helpful, and super well connected.", "This prof. is one of the best teachers I've ever had! The amount of material on each test can be easy (MUTIPLE CHOICES), but if you study the exam review a week or so ahead, you'll be okay. The tests can be easy, so you study hard independently to be successful in this class. An A in this class is easy, but it is attainable. HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR AL", "No Comments", "I loved this class. I really learned a lot. I recommend this class to others. It helped me overcome a lot of hears I had. He explains things well. I hope to take additional classes with him too.", "Professor Abramov, where do I even begin. His notes are confusing and his tests are extremely hard. He comes into class, talks for 75 minutes and then you leave and have to read the textbook front to back. The final was 15 chapters. He should retire, expect to self teach yourself everything. He is too difficult for an introduction course.", "He's late a lot. The class is a lot of memorization and less actual thinking. Straight lecture with pretty good stories thrown in. He likes to throw out trick questions - just let someone else answer them wrong. If you understand you *will* need geography in life, you'll do well enough.", "It was difficult to stay awake during the lectures and pay attention. I the reading tended to be more interesting than class. The information is interested but Stoever doesn't deliver it well (to say the least). Not a hard class but I wouldn't recommend it.", "I think his teaching style is good. You actually learn the stuff he teaches. Thats the good thing. The bad thing is he sometimes goes really fast in class. My suggestion is that if you had calc in high school, take him. Keep up on your homework. Some of the test problems are right off the homework or review. Good Professor overall.", "Good in teaching.. Approachable.. Tough course..", "where does the 'G' go, where the 'G' allways goes, where the danger is, where the George is.", "this is the first time eierman has taught 103 in awhile. he was extremely unhelpful and came off very cold to students. i had to learn almost every aspect of the material in this class on my own. good luck.", "Coleman expects to much from his students.If you are a full time student I do not suggest taking any of his classes.I was not expecting an easy A from his class, I do not expect any English class to be easy.

I only know 25% of my mark so far and it's March!!Almost forgot, he's always absent and doesn't give students prior notice.", "Was a very nice and intelligent guy. I would definitely take him again.", "He takes attendance at the beginning of each lecture. His lectures are not long and they are very clear. He posts them on his website so you don't have to go crazy jotting down everything. His exams come from the slides. Usually a few MC, Concepts and an Essay Q. He is a fair marker. There is also a 40% Essay. He is -also very understanding.", "This prof is honestly one of the best I've ever had.", "Professor Fogel is my favorite! He's so interesting and funny. He's also sort of an old hipster prof, which is kind of funny. At first I was thinking about switching out of his class because he mumbled so much and acted so nervous on the first day, but I'm glad I did it. His grading isn't too hard, and the reading is pretty light. Take his class!", "No Comments", "Doug is a great prof - go to the lectures to hear his `tidbits` that will never appear in any textbook!", "Doc is awesome, who would say otherwise? He's helpful and very nice. He cares about student progress and gets excited when students make improvements. He's just a cool jazz man.", "Some instructors insist their students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts, like dates or names. Good instructors make sure that the ideas seep in, and don't focus on useless details. Jeffrey is a good instructor. I feel like I genuinely learned, and I feel like my perspective on ethics have made a change for the better after finishing his class.", "This man is sooo passionate about music and the voice. He is really helpful in technique. He can be quite sarcastic sometimes, but overall, he's cool. You basically decide when you want to come to class, but, you wont want to miss it. Stress Reliever!", "I guess he is a good teacher. Definately better than the majority of ed profs at FIU, but he is extremely cocky and most of the lectures are spent listening to him explain how he is the greatest teacher ever. He is extremly opinionated and doesnt allow for students to have their own opinion pertaining to ed. Also the labs are unfair be in group B!!", "No Comments", "extremely immature", "Very very smart and knows the po-mo world of cyberculture intimately. Rightly considered the successor to Marshal McLuhan. However class ends up being mostly fun coffee cafe intellectual masterbastion. Needs some meat in the lectures.", "speaks very softly", "Course itself is pretty difficult but Mike's lectures are the best thing to listen to. He is loud and speaks his mind during class so as long as you can get pass that he's a amazing instructor to have.", "He is an amazingly cool guy. He is very easy to talk to and even though he does not have a lot of extra time to spare, if you need help he WILL find time for you always.", "Great Professor! Stats is not an easy class but he makes it very easy to learn and understandable. Just make sure to attend class and do the work and you'll get a good grade. He's also very willing to help. Reading the textbook is helpful but not necessary. He also allows cheat sheets on the exams!", "Really nice guy. Not the clearest professor, but a good guy.", "I do not recommend his class to anyone who is not a history fanatic. He assigns an ungodly amount of reading and has quizzes every week with other assignments as well. He is not clear when you ask him how you should study. If you can take another professor, I highly recommend it. He also had 2 midterms and 2 finals. Super hard class to pass.", "Dr. Peters is the type of professor every prof should strive to be. He exudes passion for his material and for student success. Yes, his class is difficult, but you learn so much. And, if I'm going to go into debt, I want to LEARN. I also might add the difficulty has nothing to do with lack of clarity or lack of helpfulness.", "Incredible.", "Promoting Student Success? Yes.", "No Comments", "Everyone gets at least a B on group project. Sketchy grader on Essay Questions. Very nice though.", "A great class and a unique lecturer. Irvine's class really changes the way you approach studies in history.It's a tough class, but worth the learning experience. Recommended if you are serious about history", "I have had Dr. Bosworth for 3 classes now. This professor has a great personality and really enjoys interacting with the students. His website is full of useful material to help ace test. overall, assignments are easy, but do require effort.", "I had him once a week for trig at night, it was not a good time, but he made the class lively. You really have to work for a good grade but he gives easy and useful extra credit, it isn't much but it could bring your test up a letter grade. Loves interacting with his students, will 100% talk to you at least once.", "tests are extremely hard. he trys to make lectures interesting, and he somewhat succeeds. definitely would not reccommend him because its hard to get a decent grade unless u want to study your life away.", "Prof. Horta is mean spirited. His jokes are often not in good fun and he puts down students indirectly; such as by mentioneing that he knows more langauges or something, or how they haven't read Hamlet? Really? etc. Ego and arrogance combine for a nasty effect. But, his course materials can be interesting and he marks fairly overall.", "I like this professor. Yes, he will give your papers back and allow you to review it for a better grade. He is very flexible, and the class is very laidback. You have homework once in awhile, but it's never strenuous, and you learn. I recommend him.", "He's an incredible professor. Modern British Novel was my favorite part of Tuesdays and Thursdays. The material is difficult, but Prof. Fogel is very encouraging and helpful. In addition he's probably the funniest professor I've encountered. His mind seems to work at lightspeed.", "great man. witty and intelligent professor. really makes you think. highly recommended.", "Dr. D. is kind-hearted and passionate about choral music. He takes a genuine interest in those students who prove interest in his classes. He does not reward sarcasm but delights in respect. He expects excellence and prides those who take the extra time to practice their parts outside of regular class time. OH, HOW I LOVE TO SING!", "Not a great speaker. We didn't use our class book at all. Required reading is a big part of this class. Lectures are long and boring. He seems awkward and says um 100 times per class. Take another professor.", "Class has both lecture and discussion. Couldn't hear him in lecutre, which was often not relevant. He often went way over on time. I'm not a class-skipper but did several times with this one, though discussion was mandatory. His paper assignment was impossible and he was little help.", "He is such an amazing prof, I schedualed my classes for next semester around him so i could take another class from him", "He's really a nice guy, someone you feel comfortable chatting with and going to with concerns about the class. It's definitely not an easy class though, myth. contains a lot of information and it takes a lot of studying time to be successful on his exams.", "Seems totally disorganized. Not helpful in any way. Doesn't really know what he's talking about. I was totally dissatisfied. Do NOT reccommend.", "He is a nice guy. Not the best class.

Burton's stories are interesting and easy to follow. He's very approachable and understanding, so no worries about talking to him after class. You respect him right off the bat for his knowledge and experience in the field. Class gets our early often.", "He says that he's available to talk about assignments and loves to see what students have come up with, but every time I talked to him he just grimaced and gave one-word answers. Not helpful in the slightest. Also, expect to lose credit on fully functional programs because they don't meet specific criteria that he doesn't share with the class.", "He is a horrible teacher and kinda creepy. We never once looked at a map, and it was a Geography class!!", "A sad loss for Sonoma State. Truly the best at the entire institution.", "Chuck Fields is a very good professor to take for Drugs class. Very knowledgeable on illicit drugs and their history.

Focuses mainly on effects of drugs and also lots of history about government propaganda and media scares that have led to drug criminalization.", "I had Dr. Arrigo a number of years ago as a graduate student, and his classes were nothing like what these freshmen are describing. Attendance was mandatory, class discussions were stimulating, and papers were challenging. He was one of the best teachers I ever had.", "He's brilliant and charismatic. His passion is contagious and he really cares about the subject, his students, and the world. Great teacher!", "His lectures are all over the place, but I love how he tells you a lot of what's gonna be on the exams. Good guy.", "Funny thing that everyone is complaining about him this year. I definitely agree based on my experience in first year; he is indeed heartless and does not care about his students.", "Provides textbook for free online. A very easy \"A\" if you study for the tests and write the essays. Attendance is not necessary besides test and group work days because all the material and instructions you will ever need are online.", "I took him for Business 1 (intro) and earned an A. now that im taking him for finance and marketing I've noticed that he OFTEN repeats himself and thus the class becomes repetitive and boring at times. he has a sense of humor, his lectures are fun but he's never there for office hours and he doesn't notify students when he's absent.", "Forget \"tough but fair\". He's not fair, and his toughness is artificial. If you fail to make the arguments he wants you to make, in the way he wants you to make them, the grade you receive will not reflect your work.", "This prof is full of himself. His class was boring and he's snubs students. Thinks he's hot but really he's not. Has an attitude that keeps us from asking questions. It's all about him after all.", "Very good at getting his message across in class. Manages to make a relatively boring topic semi-interesting. You really don't need to go to class, though. Everything is in the textbook. Going to class does help to clarify.", "The entire class is based on the midterm and the final exam. You don't really have to do the readings until you're studying, and theres no textbook so thats a bonus. Study hard for the exams and you'll do fine. He is incredibly intelligent. Don't take this class if you're looking for an easy mark!", "don't take his class if you're a ****, not if you're a woman! why not transcend to substance? he's not out to judge anyone personally. Art CAN be****ty. not just because it's got no talent. personal working process & style has to been CRITICIZED to improve. self-involved catharcism is why no one gives a**** about art. we have to take drastic steps towards art that actually ROCKS. Paul has crystalized this vision that may never be seen again if it's been seen before. prof's don't come this UNstuffy.", "Tests are pretty much identical to practice tests. He is somewhat forgetful and sometimes talks about off topic things for the whole class. Overall, I enjoyed his classes and would def. take him again.", "the worst teacher I have every had. I took him for engineering physic. Spends to much time going over the note that he did not even write himself and do no help. Does not explain himself well.

Difficult class but rewarding.", "He makes class interesting although very challenging. I liked him so much in Calc one I took him in Calc two.", "This class seems super cool but it is quite boring at times. It focuses on the history of art but he's a cool guy.

There is extra credit, take the class!!", "His lectures make no sense but you never have to show up to class. He only gives a midterm and final and as long as you get the review he gives out the class before youll do fine.

He is a very cool teacher is style of teaching is like no other teacher. Hey makes you do pretty fun activities. You dont have test but must do the homework.", "It's not terribly compelling material to teach, but Prof. Giarratani augments it with topics relevant to his students' lives.

He is often unclear about what he expects and sometimes thinks you know things that you don't. He is a stickler on grading, but ok in general.", "I had Ian in a very large lecture hall. From what others have told me he shines much better in the smaller classroom size. Because of the large size, I did not enjoy his teaching style. It was hard to hear him and I sat in the close half. If you take him, make sure it is is a smaller setting.", "One of my favorite profs. Has a very dry, sophisticated sense of humor, an awesome lecturer.

The vet ALTERS the puppy dog.\" It's all in good fun.", "this is one of those classes i was afraid to take, but he made it so nice. he goes out of his way to explain things and engage class. Some of the material is boring, but overall I think it has been pretty interesting;would take another 1 of his classes.", "Dr. Barden is one of the nicest people you will ever meet, and his sense of humor is hilarious! All of the exams are based on the Powerpoint slides from lectures, and he provides study guides and practice exams. Just attending the lectures will probably earn you a high grade and the lectures are, for the most part, interesting.", "You will have him if you are a Bio/BMS major and you'll wish he taught every course. He's the man. Really cares about the students.", "If you know a little hebrew than you wont have a problam. If you dont know anything its not terribly hard, but youll have to work. Overall he is a very nice guy. You have no choice if you take hebrew because hes the only teacher (which is not such a bad thing)", "I have to agree with everyone else here - Todd is the best teacher I have ever had. He's a really quirky and hilarious. His higher-level courses are difficult, but if you make a real attempt at understanding the content he is decently lenient with grading. If you EVER have a chance to take a class with him, DO IT. Great advisor and mentor too.", "David Perkins is a good teacher. He cares about his students, and is available for help whenever you need him.", "I had him for a humanities class a few years age, he is not an understanding professor. Grades very hard and gives extremely difficult exams......", "Thom is a very interesting guy. Be prepared for that most of all. His subjects, in my opinion, are a little dated but they are pretty easy to write about. He's a tough grader but if you know how to write, this class will be a breeze, just be prepared to work at it.", "No Comments", "He was terrible, he just rambled on for his lectures. I read the textbook and still didn't do very good on the quizes.", "Dr. Sumner was absent throughout his online class. I believe he might be the only professor that teaches the required qualitative statistical method course needed to gain a Psych degree. I will look to take elsewhere and transfer in credit. I will never take a course w him again. He wasted my $. I learned nothing.", "Gets confused easily. Assignments/tests can be difficult because you don't know what he wants or will ask. Definitely has favorites. Gives a lot of projects along with quizzes/tests. Almost deaf! It's hard to ask questions in class.", "This guy thinks he is the king of the universe (since he is just an associate dean). He is going to be a bad reputation for Carleton. I don't know a single person who likes him. try to avoid him.", "Has a greater passion for outreach than finance.", "pretty good prof", "He is honestly one of the sweetest people I have encountered. He is so kind and genuine and really cares about his students. The class is an easy A, and he is a very very good person.", "Great professor. He is always on the level with his students and will do almost anything to help them out.", "Kept talking about his mother. I don't know what she's got to do with mixing slip, but there it is. He's more interested in landscaping than teaching. Some folks should just not have tenure.", "Dr. Rahimzadeh is an awesome professor. He's funny, relevant,and crystal clear with the material. You WILL leave knowing that you didn't waste your time or money. Do the homework and show up for class. Also, acting projects are BIG in this class. VERY fun! NOTE: If you don't want to act, don't take his class.", "He is trash. I had 3 tests and 2 lab practicals and each test and practical was completely different than the last making it almost impossible to know how to study. The 2 lab practicals in particular were a complete 180 from each other we basically guaranteed me to fail. He is mean, uncaring, and he likes to make rules to hurt you.", "For a guy who can't get his own poetry published this guy was pretty tough on other peoples art. What we learned were his prejudices about poetry and how to write representational poetry. He needs to realize that anyone who does the work is really trying to be creative and be sensitive to how hard it is to put personal stuff out there like that.", "It was much easier paying attention in class Jay. He keeps things entertaining. His tests are VERY STANDARD. He is more worried about understanding concepts than memorizing equations.", "Awful.", "Dude rocks, his web site and down loads helped.", "Dr. F is the best!! He cares for each and every student that is sitting in front of him. He has been so helpful to me throughout my stint here at EKU. He has been with me every step of the way. He was also my adviser. If you want to learn from the best, take Dr. F. He really is awesome!", "One of the absolute worst professors at UVU. The class is hard and he makes it that much harder. If he is your only option don't take it. He brags about how hard test are. Avg on one test was 55 on a class with over 150 students and he said he was impressed that people had such a high average. Avoid at all costs!", "I hated this class. I have never not liked a professor, but I cannot stand this man. If you have ANY conservative values, RUN! All he does is talk about how horrible conservatives are and how wonderful liberals are. Even when you can prove him wrong, he will ignore any arguments against his teaching. Unfortunately, I can't type enough for stories.", "He is extremely nice and very passionate about the subject but is all over the place. It is hard to know what to study when test time comes around.", "What kind of promises would a professor make to a student? That's weird... this guy is the best teacher I ever had.", "Difficult, but totally awesome. Worth the work!", "My worst experience in this university so far. Absolutely confusing, you go take the test equally prepared every time, and one time you get an A, another a C, then A, then C... random. Infuriating experience, I get 100%s in high math classes and came out discouraged from his class. Avoid at ANY cost.", "He was everything you would want a college professor to be extremely intelligent, fascinating and a bit arogant all at the same time.", "Very difficult...If you want to pass Econ, DO NOT take it with him. Tests are very tricky; multiple choice, but it is often the type with Choice I,II,II or Choice I&II only (those kind). Didn't learn much in the ways of Econ. In fact, I have to retake it!", "I learned to hate the language I already know. He holds a chair in the dept., he lets you know at the beginning of every lecture, however what chair exactly I do not know. Very, very unprofessional and pompous.", "His lectures will either bore you out of your mind or have you laughing every 5 minutes. He's quite entertaining and really funny during lectures, however very strict. He has a very strict policy about cell phones or any electronics for that matter, and I suggest not even thinking twice about using it during lectures.", "Kickin Prof", "One of the best professors I have ever had, the best I have had at PLU so far. Great learning experience always engaging class sessions with fun content and awesome guest speakers. Really helped me do well in class obviously he cares for his students, even wrote a recommendation for me. Would highly recommend taking any of his courses.", "awesome luved his class.......", "He'll spend the first hour talking about current events. Digresses so much it's insane Funny old guy with good stories and one-liners. Study guide has everything you need to know, so show up if you want. Easy A.", "Klaas was a great prof. Critical Thinking is an incredibly boring and slow course, but you could tell he was passionate about it and really knew the material well (I'm pretty sure he played a role in writing the curriculum?) He posts the audio and powerpoint slides for every lecture on d2l, so you don't have to go to class. Overall a great class", "Caring, personable, very distinct teaching style--invites students to participate, helps freshman muddle their way through college writing. Often shares interesting personal anecdotes with the class. Wide range of teaching experience evident. One of my favorite professors!", "Although a good lecturer, he's extrememly biased and unfair on essays.", "Amazing and funny lectures, has a very honest view of American Government which I enjoy. His quizzes and papers are super easy, I literally read / learned nothing and still got a 4.0. Make sure you turn stuff in, because if not he might not get back to you to turn in late work. Also, assignments are due at 5:00 PM, not 11:59!", "very very helpful ! It was a really tough class, but he gives extra work that boosts your grade. He's very funny and keeps class interesting . I go to him for help even in my other chemistry courses I have with other teachers. Recommended prof, just dont take the class expecting an A.", "very enthusiastic; interesting lectures on the subject", "I learned more useful stuff in this class than any other class. Great Prof.", "He is absolutely ridiclious. He only grades you on tests, but assigns written work that only counts as \"participation\" His lectures are boring and his grading is really unfair. Avoid him at all costs.", "No Comments", "Prof. Spears is by far the BEST professor/instructor/teacher I have had in my entire University experience. He was always so excited to start the lecture and actually cares about what he is teaching students. I've taken two classes with him already and plan on taking any more that I can in my last year. Highly recommend taking any class he teaches", "he is crazy, he knows so much but he s difficult to understand because he is always everywhere! so so smart though", "Very comfortable pace for a Calc class. He goes over several examples for each topic and leaves time at the end of class for questions. Very easy to reach to meet during office hours. If you're trying to get into the school of business but struggle with Calc, he's the perfect teacher.", "professor gay is my favorite professor so far at conn.", "I love Prof. Rose!! If you are majoring in Communication, you have to take at least one class with him! He gives a lot of work, but you'll learn a lot. As long as you put a little effort in, you'll do well! He is lightning fast with responses. If you send him a paper he'll get it back to you in like 10 minutes. Insane.", "he is really poor! ESL class is so worth than others. if you take his class, you will be regret your choose. he likes only female students. he never use textbooks. he never hear students' questions. he is veryveryvery poor~!!!!!!!!!", "(210)This class is really easy you get study guides for the test look up what's on the study guide and you got an A in the class. Lectures are pointless you don't really learn anything. 200 is fun if you liked Health and Phys. Ed. in highschool that's basically all it is you don't really learn why you do the tests you just kinda do them.", "He seems like he's too smart to teach an entry level chemistry class. Although I like that he gives goals and objectives sheets before tests, he doesn't do a very good job with explanation. He goes off on tangents quite often. He does demonstrations in class that are pretty cool. He tries to joke around but seems a little bit uptight.", "Jerry is awesome, he really cares about each on of his students, his lectures are interesting and informative, I found myself actually looking forward to attending class(something i didn't think was possible in a math class). That being said his test are not easy, if you are gonna skip class and not do the homework don't take calc with Jerry.", "Dr. Curra is the best professor I've ever had. Pay attention, take good notes, and read what he tells you and you will do fine.", "Great class with a great professor!! would HIGHLY recommend", "Geib is awesome! Basically there are just two projects and two test during class and the rest of the time is just discussion. This class can be an easy A if you show up and study whenever necessary (which is very little)", "Chaney is the best! He won't restrict your ideas on projects and always offers great feedback. His class was fun and enjoyable, even though it was at 8am. He really knows how to engage the class and get everyone talking.

We had great discussions after class. I learned a lot from him.", "MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR ON EARTH!!!", "does NOT lecture topics covered in tests. pointless to come to class everyday, no classes on Friday (2 paragraph research paper instead). he covers the entire test a few days before class, discussing and answering all the questions. You can pass with a B if you just show up, take notes. if you miss class only 1 point per class missed.", "This guy has some serious issues. I suggest avoiding him at all cost. You can get online and teach yourself way more than this jackass could ever convey!", "HE IS THE WORST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD. Author's notes, author's study guide, HIS TEST...and anything that could be unclear he DOESN'T CLARIFY. He sucks.", "Not the easiest class. You have to pay attention and read, or an A is out of the question. Class attendance helps too. Nice guy though, curved my B to an A because I attended most of the classes and made high B's on the tests.", "Lazy teacher, makes you teach the class when he is supposed to, tests are beyond hard, people getting 50's with a curve? skip him for every class...hopefully he will get fired soon.", "His lectures are wonderful!", "He helps out when you ask for it. In the first semester you just need to stand up to him when he criticizes you and he'll respect you. Make sure to put units on everything.", "Not very clear in his explanations. Lectures tend to be pretty boring. Funny jokes sometimes.", "Professor Giarratani is one of the best professors I've had at PITT. He has a genuine love of economics and it shows in his teaching. All his examples are crystal clear and are applicable to the real world. I guarentee even if you are not interested in economics you'll still leave the class feeling more informed and prepared for life after college.", "Dr. Hupp is one of the funniest professors at SIUE. He makes class fun and you learn a LOT!", "Professor Scherb was terrible! I took his bio course and was so lost! I am a very smart person and an even better student but professor Scherb changed all that! His tests are very difficult, he belittles you and embaresses you among your classmates and he flirts with alot of the girls, very unprofessional. AVOID THIS CLASS BY ALL MEANS", "Do not take him if you want to learn something. I got nothing out of his lectures. Was a waste of my money and time", "Good class, as long as you show up and pay attention you'll pass. If you're struggling just attend SL sessions and its almost impossible to fail.", "some may never go to medical school but rather than guide and help he discourages and tells you that you don't have a chance. find someone else if you want help and advice or do it yourself, he reserves real effort for those who are a sure bet to get in.", "LOVE HIM. SO AWESOME and FUN", "Mr. Filson is hands down the best instructor i have encountered at Grcc! He goes above and beyond his duty and comes to class earily often! It is not a easy class but if you put in the hard work, ask questions(which he is always glad and eager to answer), and attend class you should do well and even if you dont, you will learn to love his class.", "Steve is a very good teacher. I came to Canada from another country and English is not my first language. Steve really helped me to become a better communicator and I loved his classes.", "Ned is an easy professor. Just review the slides before the exam and you will get an A. He gives numerous amounts of extra credit. If you pay attention in lecture then reviewing won't be much at all. There are old exams and study guides to prepare you. Easy A", "Class was enjoyable. Shorr gets a bad rap for getting upset when students talk w/o raising their hands, but his lectures are involved and straight off the top of his head so he doesn't like being taken off track. Be a respectable student who pays attention and you'll do fine. He speaks fast so be sure you can keep up w/ note taking.", "I loved Professor Blitz! I took a class with him and Professor Sarna and it was amazing! Granted, it's a lot of work, so expect that! But he makes the content fun and is able to relate to the students. Great professor! And if it's an ISP class, you don't need a textbook!", "I took the class AHC 115-V31 Med Term, college @ home course. Test are super easy.. only 4 all together. 3, are 75 multiple choice and 1, is 50 MC Q's. Just study and make note cards. I had no medical background what so ever and passed with a 94!! Extra credit is offered :)", "He gives you all of the notes in a coursepack at the start of the semester and attendence isn't required, but he will bump up your grade if you're there frequently enough for him to recognize your name. The tests come directly from the study guides he gives you, and all of the answers are in the course pack. Very good prof and easy class!", "He's more of a stand and talk kind of guy. His handwriting can get a bit messy to read; however, his lectures are pretty amazing. Dr. Baugher's classes are definitely great to take. Although he does make a huge deal about independent reading and answering questions, he incorporates his lectures with the reading. Show up, Read, take notes and pass.", "Mr. Hood is the most incompetent instructor I have ever had.", "He does give a lot of work. You have homework problems and group problems that can be very time consuming. I suggest not to take both classes at the same time.

Do the work and pay attention and you'll be fine", "Best instructor I had at Newpaltz. Very supportive, clear, and helpful.", "This class is difficult. He is not always easy to understand (and sometimes it's him and not the topic). However, he's passionate about what he teaches. He's willing and available to help you. He's never condescending or mean when you don't understand. He's patient. He listens, and he will help you. He respects commitment to quality.", "I LOVE THIS TEACHER. seriously i hate math and cannot understand his silly accent but the tests are a breeze, show up the day before for the review and you will get an A no questions.", "Courses taught are very boring and structured poorly. You'd learn more alone.", "Quite arrogant and doesn't entertain any opinions other than his own. Admittedly subjective grader. Changed requirements with LITERALLY no notice. Only thing he'll help you learn in class is that he A. went to Harvard B. worked for Reuters C. has a law degree PhD. You'll hear it ad nauseum.", "Has a very thick accent, but all his notes and examples he puts on the board are clear and straight forward. Very useful for Math 60. Daily lectures help tremendously with the HW. DO the HW to help pass the quiz the next day. Quizzes are daily. He will go over anything people have trouble with. Grades on a curve.", "I had Dr. Cavaiola for 3 classes-psychopathology, marriage, and family. He is not easy, but the best professor to take if you want to learn a lot. His classes are fun and interesting, and he is very professional and fair. He is the epitome of what a professor should be.", "Very dry. Super nice guy though... ^_^", "Professor Panzarella is a very fair grader. Plus, he is very well educated person! I have learned a lot from the professor. The class was very informative. Professor treats his students as adults. Very interesting course. Not that hard. All you have to do is just read the texts. Loved this class!", "Hard to make history of witchcraft uninteresting, but this prof does not seem to even know what he's talking about half the time. He does not respond to students questions effectively and does not prepare lectures well. He usually just ends up reading out of a book, or showing us useless movie clips. Easy to get extensions on papers though.", "Great prof! While the content is hard, he is a funny lecturer and makes it really difficult to fail! Wouldn't take the class as an elective but Czajkowski makes it easy to enjoy. Hilarious emails too!", "I was excited to take his Sex in the City one program, and the first term was okay, but the second he just piggy backed off of the other one program profs, and had very little to do with sexual diversity. He doesn't care for his students' opinions or mental health, and though some of the readings and trips were good, an overall disappointment.", "Mark is a good professor. He really teaches his classes as opposed to just sitting back. I feel I'm learning a lot more in Int. than I did in beginning w/a different professor.", "He likes to go on and on about his whole lifestory. Do not expect him to stay on topic. Most of the things you learn in this class will be from the textbook, not from him. He only took attendance 3 times so a lot of people skipped many of his classes and just did the readings. But he didn't assign any papers or homework. Other than that, he's nice.", "I'm a senior and this was the worst class I've ever taken. I chose this professor because he had good ratings here, but they haven't been updated in a couple years, because something must have happened to turn this guy into a total prick. He is mean, unhelpful, and just downright rude to students. !!!NO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!", "It is a more difficult 5 credit class, but in the end your grade could be better than what you may think. He can be very helpful, but you must approach him. You should have some interest in the atmosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere.", "I really disliked Daniel for much of the year but in the end - I warmed up to him after realizing that he actually did care about students and wanted them to do well. Class tended to be quite chaotic - which I didn't like- but I think I did some of my best work of the year in his class. A good guy in his heart of hearts....I think.", "No Comments", "Had him for Intro to personality. His lectures are unclear. He goes off topic a lot. It was hard to grasp much in his class; SUPERRRR boring. He also makes you buy his his own books which is $100 for both. Decent guy, bad prof.", "Geib knows what he's talking about and is very passionate. Grades consist of 2 group presentations/papers, 4 short essays, and 2 tests on important terms.", "He may have a long resume, but that does not mean he knows how to teach. In fact he was one of the worst professors of my college career. not because he was hard but because he was so inept at teaching the subject. In addition, he was short tempered and rude. During one of our midterms he sat in the", "The amount of work he gives is ridiculous. I was doing way more homework then my other friends who had a different phil 101 teacher. However I managed to get all of my work done and ended up with an A. The work isn't difficult it is just very very time consuming.I also learned nothing about creative thinking. Choose a different professor!", "Really confusing and slow. Often goes on random or semi-random tangents. The class progresses really slowly as he randomly comments on students who say something, walk in late, or are just sitting minding their own business. I'd like to emphasize the slowness. It's November, and our 1st test was this past Monday. No assignments though.", "Dr. K was awesome! He always kept my interest and made a Thursday night class tolerable, which is really impressive.", "Good guy. I got screwed on the curve, and he wouldn't help me out, but I still think he is a good guy and a good teacher. I'm sure if you went to him for help, he'd be helpful, I just wouldn't know for sure.", "Kurt is a very boring lecturer. He does a lot of talking about advanced geology and his research, but forgets that this is an introductory geology and we don't really know all that much about it. He likes to put up pictures and explain them in complex details before we even understand the words he says.", "Jim Slowiak is one of the best teachers i've had at the University of Akron. I learned more about acting technique in one semester from him, than any other professor in my six years at Akron. His views are different, but worth experiencing.", "He great! Definitely recommend! Test are easy!", "Very passionate about computer science! He gets really excited when talking about certain topics. He keeps the mood up with lots of geeky computer jokes. Labs and projects are challenging but not too difficult if you pay attention. If you like computer science you will enjoy the class. He doesn't require a textbook, either.", ".", "No Comments", "His classes are totally unorganized. Horrible to try to take notes from his lectures.", "no one can get A in his class. He dosent change the materials over the years. If u have all essays and exams u will get an A. i dont like him personally.", "Good class. Will learn more here than in most classes but if you hate speaking in class it might not be for you. But the class is defiantly not boring", "No Comments", "Awesome teacher!!!!! I really like to take his class. As I am a international student, many terms I can't understand, and he just explain these terms in easy way and help me a lot!!!

I am a woman and I had no problem with him.", "He's a nice guy, and will try his best to pass you if you show effort, but he just cant teach. He goes rediculously fast in spots, painfully slow in others, and has all his notes on overheads which he changes out b4 you finish writing. A decent prof to take but you'll wind up learning most of everything from the book. Does help in office hours.", "Professor Kawchuk's class is great! It may have alot of content, but it's the only class I truly enjoy going to, even though it's at 8 in the morning!", "Very smart and funny/sarcasitc - def. knows the material. Problem is: won't teach it to you. Calls on students (ClassMaster, or takes volunteers) but doesn't use Socratic - will expect you to answer your own questions. Bad choice for such a crucial 1L subject - a shame b/c he is very smart and entertaining but the combo is wasted potential on 1Ls", "Awesome prof.

WELSCH!!!", "No Comments", "Very knowledgeable", "Professor Ream was a sweet old man and tries really hard to teach well, but it's a struggle. His lectures are wildly confusing and he goes off on tangents and abandons problems without actually showing us the answer. He gives a TON of extra credit and curves everything, so this class wasn't awful. If math is a tough subject for you, I'd stay away.", "Super easy. He does take attendance but told me that he only counts off one point every day you don't come. And You do have to write the little half page papers every week, but he also only counts off one point for not doing those too.

Dr. Gutliph was the first to put this class online and I struggled until the end. I suppose the course will get refined and better but It is so NOT an easy A. My class found plenty of online videos I am sure he will share with the next classes. Overall he is a fair grader", "Attending this class was akin to chinese water torture. Day after day of hearing his voice meander through the material just wore me down. Several things really got to me, such as his method of writing a name/place/date down then standing in front of it and the lack of any real structure to the class.", "Do not take him! He is more worried about his \"group study\" than the students. The average on the final was 65% and that is considering the curve! I ended up with around 85% on the final, and I ended with a B.

(He's now teaching at Yale.)", "Great Hebrew Prof. Jokes aren't that great, but nice helpful guy", "Professor Walker is good at explaining the subject matter and very helpful.

He makes economics interesting and he's also friendly and funny.", "he wasn't that bad for Business Organ. we had a lot of assingments and 3 tests. plus we had 3 group projects. so there is a lot of points you can get. he curved everything we got back. i would totally reckomend him for 220 evadently not for the upper level classes. he was nice to our class and we got out on time.", "I feel like I actually had to work for the A in this class for both the exams and the speech. So if you are taking a lot of classes and you want an easy A for speech, I suggest you take this class over the summer because you are required to work hard for the A. Also, you have to practice for the speech to get a good grade as well as read the book.", "He is a professor who is genuinely interested in the material he teaches. His teaching style is refreshing. He is genuinely interested in the performance of his students, and offers much guidance.", "I counted the number of uh's and um's and there were 55 in 5 minutes. I found I was so distracted by his speech impediment that I couldn't focus on the words in between the uh's. He's a stubborn old man who grades unfairly. His tests are long and hard. The reading was difficult to keep up with as well. This class was a GPA killer.", "Very full of himself. Class was easy enough, I guess but he really thought he was a lot smarter than he really is.", "Nicest professor I've encountered. You'll pass the course if you turn in every assignment.

The reviews for the test are extensive and descriptive.", "I loved this course! He makes the material so interesting and is really nice.", "Freaking love this guy- I think his F bomb record is 10 a class. Takes nothing seriously but really really knows his stuff. His goals are to make us laugh and help us view the world around us with a healthy dose of criticism/ humor. Probably one of my fave people on the planet!", "Should've listened to everyone on here. Not sure how this guy still has a job. Unreal requirements that would not apply in the real world. All based on what HE wants to see, not what is logical. Even if you're work is correct, it has to be done in his ridiculously specific manner in order, and you will STILL lose points. Avoid at all costs!", "He was a great professor very specific in what is and is not going to be on the exam.", "I found myself more worried about following \"his way\" then actually learning the material. The problems that he works out on the board would be counted wrong in his exams. He avoids doing problems his way because its a waste of time, but yet still expects you to do it his way. The class is fine, just chose a different instructor.", "Smart man, only if he knew this is not a 4th year course. I give him an A on what he knows and a Z for thinking that we'll know as much as he does at the end of the course. Your Laptop is garbage.

Yes, he is a hard teacher, but if you want to be a manager in an entertainment industry, the type and amount of work he makes you do, you will probably do 10 times more in the real world, unless you want to be a secretary for the rest of your life. Yes, it's busy work, but it prepares you.", "Also took Handy for eco301. His courses are very straightforward. Read, and you'll be fine.

However, he is very clear and sets his expectations. The material is not hard but some of it has to be self-taught. This class would have been much more engaging if he prepared his lectures but overall it is not a difficult course and is very interesting.", "Professional Ethics was maybe the most interesting and engaging class I have taken at Wayne. Corvino wanted us to be involved in the discussion and found a way to make a potentially boring subject really interesting. If you came to class and read the material then you were pretty much set up for an A. I definitely recommend a class with him.", "His lectures are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. He likes to give out exam related problems during the lecture, so it's best to show up. He grades a bit harder than most, but you will do fine if you do the recommended problems and show up to class.", "One of the better teachers in the CS department", "Dr. Lombrana is a wonderful instructor, his attention to detail and student oriented teaching approach is outstanding. I've had a variety of college professors, but he is by far the best instructor I've ever had. He is very dedicated to seeing his students succeed and I hope that someday, I can give to others the knowledge that he has given to me..", "His lectures are a little boring. However, he makes math to be \"candy\" and is very helpful, especially in office hours", "very good professor. one of the best. you must come to class, pay attention, and do the readings. my only problem was learning phi lingo. but that was on me. not prof's fault. good class", "Teddy is my hero! Best prof I've ever had. He always kept my attention with his antics about Mrs. McGillicutty, his little songs, and his famous accents! Unfortunately, Western did not recognized his sheer brilliance in the classroom, and they have NOT renewed his contract. What a loss to our department! We will all miss you very much Teddy!", "Professor Ibrahim is fast paced. His exams are found in the library, previous exams. He does not place much emphasis on homework, little to none. *If you challenge him be prepared to stand your ground; He is tricky so be careful.", "If you want an easy A, take his class! You do very little work.. He curves his tests like 100% so it's impossible for u to fail.. You just have to show up to class. He's kind of strange but i got used to him.", "He was definitely one of my favorite professors! He was funny and kept your attention all through the class. Although attendance is not mandatory, it is best to be there! He covers a lot of info. class that makes it easier when reading the book. It is a bit of challenge, but not too bad!", "The class curriculum is very interesting, but I wouldn't say he teaches in the best way. He talks to his classes as if he's a parent lecturing to a thirteen-year-old. He's the type of professor who always thinks he is right, so he is very critical of his students' work.", "Brian is a great teacher who loves what he does and it shows. His notes were great and I found the lectures interesting and informative. Overall I found his classes very easy.", "This is not an easy class. One should not expect to walk in and ace it. You will never use a textbook in his class which is nice. Instead you use 5 small-large books. The class is a study of philosophical ideas and how they can be applied to morality in daily life. Your grade is mostly comprised of two papers and 2 tests. Tests = easy. Papers = not", "If you're lazy, like me, take Reimer for your PESS requirement. If you want, you can just walk around the track for 40 minutes. Easy. You don't really have to exert yourself too much. Plus, he's almost NEVER in the fieldhouse during class time, so you can take breaks and he won't even notice. Some students even sat around for the entire period.", "just not interested anymore, it's so obvious", "Terrible, avoid at all costs", "THIS MAN SHOULD NOT BE A PROFESSOR; HE IS A KIND MAN BUT THIS MAN DOES NOT TEACH OR PROVIDE MATERIAL TO LEARN FROM. HE IS A HORRENDOUS PROFESSOR AND SHOULD NOT BE EMPLOYED AS A PROFESSIONAL TEACHER. I HAVE LEARNED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FROM HIM AND IM SO ANGRY I SPENT MY MONEY ON HIS CLASS; 800$ OF TOENAILS COULD TEACH ME MORE THAN HE EVER HAS", "He is very helpful and is willing to give his time to you. He also lets class decide if they want to be there or not at times", "Very easy class and Prof. Dibble is a nice guy. This specific course needed to be a little more structured, he was as lost as we were.", "He is an ok Professor. Very nice, but can ramble. Going to class is not necessary. He posts all of the slides online before the lecture. There are three exams. The final (third exam) contains word for word questions from the first two, so make sure you review those with the TA. There is a generous curve on everything, and extra credit offered.", "OMG! this professor is amazng. Everyone should take him. Although his tests are a little hard with studying you should come out with a c or higher. But dont think that you can get by without even trying a little! Wernli makes you laugh and loves biology. He's a honest to good man who loves to help his students. I recommend him anytime!", "The best prof ever!!", "He goes off topic and gets into politics. He is a very successful investor and a former Special Operations naval officer. He is an expert on making money. If you want to get technical on details then take other professors but if you want to talk business in general terms then this is the professor to take.", "No Comments", "Run away", "I worked hard but learned a lot.. Hes a very nice man.", "My super ego is drawn to say he is a decent teacher for moral reasons, but my Id says he is the most boring teacher imaginable. Every class he reads directly from the powerpoints and tells stuff related to material he thinks is funny but isnt. To pass his class you must always go to class, and complete online work, If you dont get As on his tests.", "I actually learned a lot about things of social importance in this class and it opened my eyes to the world after taking only science classes prior to it. I hardly went to lecture, but the material was interesting and it was an easy A. In section we had one paper that wasn't even graded. Exams were somewhat tough but curved high", "Very helpful teacher. Communicates well with students.", "Do not recommend if you are not an ENGL major; its a hard pass. Not approachable at all, and puts himself before his students. Attendance is mandatory and participation is crucial (in class + online discussion boards and he keep track of how many times you post). Midterm and Final, both essays. no other assignments. Tough grader.", "Dr. R is a gem in the EM program. He is a tough grader and is picky about what he wants, but he makes you work for your degree. Honestly he is not exactly an expert in the field of sport and music management but he will try his best to help you out and find people that can answer your questions. He really cares about his students. Get to know him!", "Rambles a lot. He takes up half of the class going on his \"Midkiff diversions.\" We're paying money to get an education, not listen to stories. His in-class examples are nothing like the test questions and the homework problems are unnecessarily hard. If you get above a 60, he counts them as a 100 because \"the program messes up.\" The book sucks too.", "He reminds me of my grandfather. I want to hug the guy. Gets confused easily in class, but helpful when you go to see him during his office hours. You can rewrite your papers if you dont do well on them too, which is a plus. Overall, not difficult to get at least a B+ in his class.", "John is by far the best professor I've had at Northwest, he's not like all the other english department teachers who bore you with pointless material that you can't even understand. He makes the class fun and worth your time!", "I enjoyed his class. Yes, his tests were slightly difficult, but if you study the material you'll be ok. He graded the wellness projects pretty easy, too. He really knows what he's talking about, I would recommend him to anyone!!", "Mr. Tyson is hard. In the first 2 weeks of class, you're flunking, or you're catching on, & realize he requires dedication on some level to even slide. I took BIO at another college 3 times & dropped it. Boring. Tyson's grading required me getting on board. Suddenly, the subject & teacher changed everything. Almost 30yrs later, I still remember it!", "And he's still helping me..", "Great teacher, and is straight foward. I have had several math professors at parkland. And he is the best i have had! Good amounts of homework, but not strenous. Quizzes and tests are very clear, and are similar to what YOU ARE ACTUALLY STUDYING IN CLASS!!!", "He doesnt teach well, he talks to the board and doesnt answer questions. he wont help you if you have a problem with your grade and he isn't very organized.", "I had from 1492-Civil War, and though it was occasionally boring, it was still a good class. If you fill out the study guides then you will ACE the tests and the states/capitals test is easy as long as you know the info. He has fascinating stories to tell that add interest to the class. He taught a class on Revelation at my Church, and I LOVED it!", "one of my favs", "This is the best class I have taken at U of O so far. It gives incredible insight into the dark side of self in religion just like the title suggests. Beyond that, it really teaches you a lot about yourself, I started my journey of self-discovery, which is something I did not think I would be saying. It is an amazing class, I highly recommend it.", "Very pretentious and demanding yet it works out to your advantage. He expects you to follow instructions and actually think about what you're reading. His class will make you a better reader and student.", "You really need to go to class everyday. Whoever says that he is a bad teacher is probably one of those slackers that never come to class. If you come to class, take notes, and ask questions when you have them you'll do fine. I hate biology, and I got a B. Seriously, I would definitely recommend taking him if your a hard worker.", "Many call him Ian \"the ratface\" spears", "He has a thought to offer..You just have to listen closely he talks fast!!!", "Great class. Not too hard. I learned a lot.", "Great teacher if you are interested in Physics. He is fun and makes sure to include the class in discussions/lectures. His teaching style might make it hard for a student who is not interested in Physics. Taking AP Physics makes this extremely easy.", "Often hard to understand because he is constantly mumbling and even confuses himself on various topics", "Pretty funny guy. The class got off topic a LOT. Always willing to meet w/ students during office hours to clarify any misunderstandings. I missed more than a few classes & it had no affect on my grade. Old, tries to be funny, VERY nice & understanding guy. Excepted my late work. TAKE HIS CLASS. Easy A.", "Prepare for a lot of writing. David is an excellent professor, and is very dedicated to the teaching profession.", "I agree, he's the best teacher I had at Denison. I learned more in his classes than any others.", "Class lectures somewhat interesting but mostly dull. FAR too much focus on Toronto/Ontario. Assignments marked hard and often accompanied with useless/thoughtless comments. Exams quite difficult and don't adequately represent lecture/textbook material covered.", "good teacher inter racial is a fun class", "Consistent, organized, knowledgeable; 4 thorough tests-you MUST study. Attendance is expected, hard to make up missed class. Tells real life stories; has refreshing bit of humor; will help student prepare for exam by office hours. You need notes to explain power point lectures. You might manage without book readings but they're helpful. Great prof", "One of the best teacher I have ever had!!", "I took Dr. Bob's class because all of his amazing reviews- and he is now easily my favorite professor I've ever had. He is so knowledgable and this was one of those classes you will never forget. He has the best stories and his lectures are amazing. Tests are a little long (few short answer questions) but as long as you take notes, you'll be fine!", "Homework tutorial sessions are VERY helpful, as are his office hours. His voice can be kind of monotonous, but he really knows what he's talking about.", "If I had to dream up the best online professor, It wouldn't come close to professor DelCastillo! He is awesome! Answers emails very quickly, and offers help if requested without a rude answer. Takes the time to write out key points of chapters and posts examples. no midterm, no final, just perfect", "My fav class at UVic in the past three years. An awesome, interesting prof who really knows his stuff. He needs to teach more classes!", "I am surprised at the low ratings for this prof. He is really a good teacher, if you pay attention & take good notes. Just study for the exams & it is an easy class! He is very helpful, offers extra credit & his lectures are interesting. He is clear in his speech & is the content is very understandable. It is an easy \"A\" if you prepare for exams.", "Great class, Great professor. I recommend that if you don't go to class, get lecture recordings. His exams are pretty much 99% from his power point slides, but he says a lot of stuff that aren't on the slide and he will test you on. So just looking up the slides on BB wont help that much.", "Tim is a nice guy and loves to help if asked, he will assign a lot of reading if you can stay on top of that you should do fine. He allows rewrites, & probably one the few teachers who is easy and at the same time brings out your best writing skills. he is also quite interesting and brings so many ideas to discuss, likes to incorporate Film & music", "He really hates doing examples in class and will not unless you force him to. Instead he focuses on theorems. Asking questions in class is a must. No calc or notes allowed on tests.", "if you want an egotistacal teacher with a napoleon complex, he is for you. he has very little practical experience and it is very evident.", "Took this class online and it was very easy. As long as you do the homework and practice exams it is an easy A.", "gr8", "No Comments", "His class isn't hard, just really easy to get bored. As long as you know your terms and definitions you'll be fine. He doesn't like making things too difficult so the bare minimum is how his classes are set up.", "ics 139w was one of the few classes i really enjoyed going to. very pragmatic in what he taught, but in a good way. i highly recommend him for this course.", "I actually looked forward to this class every week. Very well organized notes and a good lecturer. Very helpful outside of class also. Take him if you get the chance.", "The class, Design Culture, only has 2 teachers available to teach it. The other teacher is fine. The other is Mark who is rude, arrogant, brags and very defensive and aggressive in response to a question/problem. He hates computers also.", "Great Teacher! The course pack is helpful and he gives his students multiple opportunities to learn the material. He makes practice worksheets for help and practice quizes. You know exactly what to expect. He doesn't try to trick you and genuinely wants you to learn. He is very fair and helpful.", "The material learned is very interesting, but it takes a long time to get to the point. Has long pauses in the middle of sentences. Workshops can be fun-only if those in the class make it fun. The class is needed to debate & speak up to make things interesting. So get to know your classmates soon", "Dr. Colcord repeats everything at least 5 times. I don't reccommend that you buy the book, because he rarely uses it. He takes attendance randomly throughout the semester for a grade. I found the material taught interesting, but how it was delivered was very, very dry.", "started with lif, ended with death (The Class)", "He is very nice and helpful. Always available for office hours and answers emails very quickly. I really enjoyed the topic and he made the class fun. He picks good plays/movies and the papers aren't that hard. There are about 5 papers total and they're all about 5 pages the final paper is totally your choice on topic", "I took PSYCH 337 Comm. & Society w/ Prof. Milburn (online). The material he provides is very interesting and I really enjoyed the class. He is extremely responsive if you ask him anything which is great. The class is very straight-forward and what is expected of you is laid out clearly. The work load is fair, & if you do the work you will do well.", "Dr. Grover is one of the best teachers that Castleton has. If you want to know why the rock effervesces I recommend some Geochem.", "He's unbelievable. So inspiring and heartfelt. His eyes just light up, and everyone sings their hearts out for him. An amazing experience.", "I had Mr. Matthews and I thought he was very nice and his class was easy. Anyone looking for a easy A, take this class", "Expects you to have basic knowledge before class and have all chapters read. Doesnt waste any class time, and uses all of his time proficiently. He is quite experienced and a knowledgeable programmer although he is not good at teaching.", "He will help you out when you need it. He confused me on alot of things, but hes a good man. Accounting isn't the easiest thing to teacher...", "Excellent teacher! Loved his class, we had a blast! He taught me a lot and got me interesting in siblings and family theories!!!", "Definitely a better Chem lecturer. Knows what he's talking about and his lectures are worth attending. Notes and lectures are organized, clear, and well-developed. Not actually in his section but attended his lectures because Greenberg was awful. Jurs is a nice guy.", "Great teacher. Examples in class were very similar to questions asked on tests. Has homework due every class, but not overly difficult. Come to class and do your homework and you should get an A.", "Probably the worst professor I've had in my college career so far! Doesn't keep track of grades and won't let you know until last minute if you are missing anything. My entire grade was changed because he tried to tell me my paper was late when it wasn't late at all. I would NOT suggest him.", "Amazing. That's really all I have to say.", "Makes the subject matter more interesting than many other professors can. Down to earth and understanding professor. Loves to play devil's advocate during open discussions, so don't take his comments personally. Much better class than expected.", "This guy is a great teacher. He explains the work clearly and all you need to do is write 2 essays, which he works with you, complete a few worksheets over the semester and pass the final. I highly recommend Mr.O'Brien.", "Dr. Tjaden is such a dark spot among all the other great professors in the department. Every class was lecture read word for word from the textbook slides. Projects do not have clear criteria and require you talking to him a dozen times to actually understand them. Majorly disappointed in this class and professor.", "He's really funny if your class is well behaved. He really likes teaching. It's not a super fun class, but he makes it fun.", "AWFUL,AWFUL, AWFUL teacher! Do not take him. Nice guy but a bad teacher. His lecture has nothing to do with the tests. ANd neither do the readings. On most tests the highest grade is a C. His tests come from random topics that students have never heard of. My favorite is when he said he was a professor so he is not hear to teach.", "Gary is an amazing prof! i have never looked forward to going to any class as much as i do for Gary's! He doesn't rush through info, and repeats info that's crucial. Plus, he makes time for his students and is always willing to help. He is a tough marker but a great guy all around and soo funny! You must take this class it's amazing!", "easy class and stuff can be made up, but he has to be the hardest to understand teacher i've ever had in my life. He never answers any questions clearly and constantly mumbles. NEVER USED THE BOOK", "Macfarland combines mind and heart, he is very well read on many subjects. Although many people fail to understand his teaching style it works. He shows you had to think through scripture with intensity of the mind and with the felt of your heart. I know him well and consider him a friend.", "No Comments", "Craig really is awesome, he gives a ton of extra credit and really does care about what he teaches. It is seriously impossible to fail the class if you show up and do some extra credit. 100% take this man's class if you can, he really is awesome. I am taking one of his classes again next semester.", "Great teacher! Knows his material and is extremely intelligent! I HIGHLY reccomend him!", "No Comments", "One of the best professor in JMSB! He teaches student practical skills and finance in the real word, instead of boring textbook theory; He knows that how important the GPA is when you're trying to find a job, so he is never be a hard marker; I learned a lot from students' presentations and while improving my presentation skills.", "usually late to class, but funny and not boring.", "I skipped almost every Friday and still made an A in his class. Not the best teacher but if you decide to put in the work its an easy class. All you need to do is go over his powerpoints and do the suggested problems.", "Gerry is a seriously rude individual, and he expects you to know how to understand fluent Russian from day 1 - he doesn't speak English in class. The pace of the class is also fast and demanding for an elementary language course.", "Very amusing and funny prof. Exams are easy if you read all chapters before exam and attend all lectures. exam format: 40 MC (2 pts ea) and 2 Applied free resonse problems broken into parts (10 pts ea). Final format: 1st part: 3rd non-cumulative exam (same as above). 2nd part cumulative: 40 MC drawn from practice online quizzes (identical! easy.)", "No Comments", "He was an easy teacher. He made jokes in class and the tests were fairly simple. You can easly skip class and still get an A.", "Not going to lie. How I passed this class is literally going to class a week before a midterm to get the questions and then, I googled the stuff before class on my drive to the university. When I did attend class, the lectures were long and never on topic. The TAs were no help either as they were too busy with their own studies to help.", "Terrific teacher, would recommend to anyone!", "Vinnie is the best professor I've had by far. His lectures were the most interesting I've ever sat in. You can tell he really cares about his job and it shows in his energy. The workload: no homework, 3-4 really easy mc quizzes, and two straightforward essays. Easy A if you go to lecture and actually listen and take notes.", "All assignments are submitted online so you can use your book for everything- including midterms and finals!!", "I wish that I could have only him as a professor for the rest of my life. He is so wonderful and encouraging, and he doesn't force you to speak if you don't want to. Incredibly intelligent and nice, and he deserves some sort of award (or at least a raise!)", "he's the best and the nicest and really helpful", "Stokesbury knows what he's talking about. He's the hardest teacher I've ever had, but I also learned more in Form and Theory than 5 or 6 other graduate classes put together. Take him if you're serious about learning, not if you're looking for an easy A.", "Professor Walker is awesome. He gives good explanations and examples, and he seems enthusiastic at every class. Before class he played classic rock music. Attendance is important and this class requires work, but if you put in the proper amount of time you will do well in his class.", "One of the best professors I have ever had at Tech! I like that he always share his experiences in class. I am not sure why other students said his lectures were boring. I found his lectures interesting. He shows that he cares for students' future, not just for students to get this course checked but learn nothing. His tests were tough though.", "He is a great and knowledgeable professor. All the bad comments are from students who are just lazy and are trying to get a good grade without putting any effort.", "WORST TEACHER OF MY LIFE!!!! I have had some pretty bad teachers this man by far was the worst I would never take another class with him if my life depended on it. If you have him drop it soon.", "Easy to understand, fair in grading, and very helpful. Also very attractive.", "I took Prof Coleman's web class. We had 4 multiple choice tests over terms, a homework case study test, and a final case study test(this one was a bit difficult). If you do what is expected of you, this can be a very easy class. There is a list of terms that is given at the beginning of the semester. Memorize these and you'll make an A.", "I disagree wth the previous posting. anybody that has ever attended this class knows that its amoung the more difficult courses. i know that all the students in he class ARE majors in philo. Mr. Lilly is a very interesting, colorful person. DEFINETLY HOT!", "Cuevas was awesome! He really helped expand my writing and improved critical reading and writing. He will answer any and all questions you have and even encourages you to email whenever you have a question outside of class. He's pretty funny and nerdy too, and the essay topics are actually fun. Overall a cool class.", "If you fail this class you have no one to blame but yourself. There is a TON of memorization (it's astronomy what did you expect?), but everything that is on the test is in the textbook and mentioned in class. His stories and corny jokes make it easier to stay awake since it's a night class, too.", "Seems to understand what he is doing, but is easily the worst teacher I've had at communicating what he is talking about to students. His lack of proficiency in English can be a challenge at times, although accent is clear. Can be incredibly rude at times, calling out students for not knowing answers.", "Great teacher! Very nice and helpful, all you have to do is follow the syllabus and study the rocks and you should do great in his class!", "No Comments", "Wayne was such a great prof...he had no patience for stupidity and made sure to help students any way possible, such as by posting notes on teh internet or providing clarification. The assignments are easy if you read the text. Very Informative, I just wish he told off the morons in class.", "He is a good prof who tries to ensure he is making each point with clear. He is hard to approach however, as he always seems busy. Make sure you have questions prepared prior to speaking to him, or he'll treat you like your stupid!", "took him freshmen year, liked him so much that I asked him to be my adviser. You will work and he will call you on B.S. answers, always witty and friendly. Great as an adviser, cares about you as a person. DO THE READING!!! Cramming is useless, especially against Katz. Not deadly workload but you will be challenged. mix of lecture and discussion", "The worst teacher ever! Lots of homework! Test are hard. Does grade on curve because everyone fails", "Ruhi is very nice and helpful but has quite an accent. He makes the exams easy enough. This class was Business Statistics. I took AP Statistics in high school, so it kinda helped with acing the class and the exams. He posts all his notes online. I only looked through the book (online) if I doubted anything on his slides. I recommend him", "Prof. Curtis was an intelligent and truly selfless man. He was extremely laid back and unassuming. I'm so glad I got a chance to have him as a teacher.", "He truly thinks we have nothing else to do but read one of the 6 assigned books, 40 page chapters and internet reading every night. This man thinks our entire lives are history 102. The only part of the class that isnt terrible is the take home midterm and final. DONT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR unless you are a history buff who has no life", "He's awesome. Take him! Lot's of homework but he is willing to help all the time.", "I once saw him swallow door handle. He has the strength of nine men, and can rend armies asunder with the boom of his voice. He also knows a thing or two about Charlemagne.", "Good teacher, seems that we learn too much out of the book and not enough out of the class, but hey its just grammer. Very helpful prof if you ask him questions.", "Magder is the best! Lecture's are far from mandatory (in fact you could miss every single one and nobody would notice) but it's helpful to attend and his lecturing is engaging. The workload wasn't TOO much, but it definitely wasn't a breeze either. MC was tricky but luckily he reformatted the final quiz to only one essay!", "Fantastic professor. Cares about his students, our success, & making us think. Was incredibly understanding when I needed extensions and the amount I learned in his class astounds me. Lectures mostly coincide with the textbook & he's great at teaching so you can get good marks.

Other than that he is a solid teacher and would recommend him if you are trying to play it safe.", "Zorn is such an intriguing and intelligent guy, but the man is a little crazy! High standards on the 3 essays (basis for your entire grade..), but his dedication to helping your writing progress is just unmatched. Difficult grader, but really engaging discussion. Overall an incredibly helpful character who is amazing at what he does!", "Amazing professor! Very interesting material. I learned a lot, I highly recommend his graduate class", "Dr. Kent is brilliant and passionate about teaching. He tells his students every day \"If you don't understand please stop me.\" He truly desires student success but you have to put in your part.", "A nice little guy. He wrote the book, so he knows what he's talking about. But he WILL put you to sleep. You have no choice though, because he's the only one who teaches this class. It's not bad though. Just make sure you take notes from his power points, and read when he specifically tells you to.", "Mike is a great teacher to have for intro to programming. I had zero programming experience going into the class, but his teaching made it easier for me. When he is explaining topics and theory he really makes sure what he is saying is clear. The class is known for being hard, which is why easiness is 3, but if you go to class and work you'll do ok", "VERY boring class. Only lectures for the whole class and sometimes pass the class time. Monotoned, uses the word \"uh\" a lot. Avoid if you can! His quizzes and test have hardly anything to do with the notes, Google helped me! Decently rude and not very happy. You'll space out once he starts talking, its hard not too.", "I would make Dr. Chambers a REQUIRED professor to take if you plan on going to medical school. His approach will teach you what to expect when you get there. Dr. Chambers is very demanding but can teach you a lot if you put in the work. I'm an A student (that made a C in his class) but I received a lot of knowledge and suggest him often.", "Sadkowski lectures the entire class and it can get boring. There are only 4 exams and a couple of quizzes for grades and even with doing all the reading they were pretty difficult. He gave EC on the last two exams which was really nice. He is a nice guy and has some funny stories to tell at times. If you ask him a question he is glad to answer it.", "One of the best teachers I've come across in CST so far. Mike gives superb in-class examples that are relevant to the lab assignments. He'll take time to help out students, including running over code from several students in his office over his breaks.", "Worst class I ever took at NT. All he does is listen to himself talk. BORING. Will except no opinion but his own. Not a hard class just hard to stay awake. Tries to piss students off because even he gets bored with his endless slide shows. An idiot with half a brain could've read the book and taught the class.", "awesome prof. Irvine is a very nice, caring, and passionate prof. He is very interesting to listen to. if you ever go to his office hours, he's such a nice guy. He is very patient and makes sure you leave his room happy and confident in the material. Highly recommend taking this course for GPA boosters and having him as a prof.", "He is very clear and distinct about what he expects from you. His reviews are very similar to the tests. His tests are 3-4 questions and he counts off a lot for little mistakes. But the tests are easy if you go to class and the in class reviews.", "Really hard subject but lets you correct quizzes!", "Our class signed a petition against the way he teaches to give to the school board. It was a challenge to pay attention for more than 2 minutes. I had to repeat my question to him 6 times once until I was almost screaming.", "Caporale is an absolute jerk.

Has lots of good stories! I've had him for string ped and theory.", "Great professor, easy reading quizzes and essays. You do NOT have to be a good writer or be smart, you just need to READ. Those who didn't read got a bad grade. Those who did got a great grade. If you go to SAC, there won't be an easier History 101 teacher. Just READ for the quizes and STUDY for the exams, and you'll be good.", "Anyone who gets you excited and interested in what you are studying is a stellar professor! He's well spoken and has the best stories to tell. GO NOVA! Wish there were more professors like him.", "he's super relaxed about deadlines and he's not a control freak like most professors. he reminds me of my dad.", "WASN'T THAT GREAT OF A TEACHER", "Mr. Enomoto, is a really nice instructor. If you want to get an \"A\" you need to take this class. He lets you leave early this way you have time to go to the lab to do your homework. He also, will give extra credit toward the end of the semister.", "It's all busy work with outdated reading and over loaded tests-there are only two. Shameless self promotion of his wife and God. Has yet to respond to any of my emails and his GA's do all the work. I considered changing my major-but this is the general opinion of others involved in this major.", "I absolutely love this man. His theater background makes his history lectures extremely entertaining and you will have several good laughs. He doesn't require you buy a textbook which is fantastic and you don't get points taken away you only add on. Only downside is he doesn't use canvas. Take this class! You will learn so much.", "Really super nice guy, likes to teach, and is there to help you out in any way he can. Very helpful if you have a problem in the course. Course is interesting, readings are fairly easy.", "lectures aren't the best, you mainly learn the material by yourself. each exam is cumulative, first exam not a lot of people finish. he curves each exam but if you want to do well in this class you most definitely have to work for it.", "Nice guy; kind of weird. You know when people tell you Geology is only rocks? Yeah, that's basically it.\r \r His lectures were absoluetly boring; he made jokes that were never funny (then again it's probably because of his Canadian humour). Simple tes", "I had him for calc 1. I would definitely choose him as a prof. again. Homework isn't mandatory which means quizzes and exams are the only thing he grades. I didn't study as much as I should have and when final exams came, I struggled. He's easy to understand and helpful outside of class. If you show up to class, you shouldn't have any problems.", "Because of this professor I am suffering from depression :'( PLease switch as soon as possible.. in the begining of the semester, I came on this site to check his ratings.. I though, HEY maybe he is not bad.. I will give him a chance.. GOD, only If I had dropped the class in the begining, I wouldn't have an \"F\" on my transcript :'(", "He is an okay teacher. Yes, he knows the law but is hard of hearing and boring.", "Dr. Rorke,inspired be to declare WHP as a major and I graduated last spring.

Do not take class", "Best Teacher I Had In All 4 Years", "Professor Hyde is awesome. I learned so much from his criminology class. There was barely any homework and the tests were really easy if you paid attention and took notes in class. He lectured most of the time but he was not boring about it. He told a few personal stories. I would recommend for any class.", "The class was boring and he was boring. Tests weren't hard. Overall, I don't think I have any impression of him.", "This is the worst class I've ever taken at Cornell. Hirschl hates economics as a science(and consequently economics majors like myself) and is the most boring lecturer ever. Even the books he chose were biased. (Perrucci and Wysong thought D.A.R.E was a conspiracy to distract the masses from social inequality) I got an A+ but didn't learn much.", "Best Class EVER! Got to play video games for homework, the midterms were pretty easy and Professor Whitehead was a very nice and approachable guy. A++++", "ugh", "A very funny and entertaining teacher, with somewhat lack luster lecture material.", "Charlesworth is hilarious! He LOVES astronomy and is very clear in his lectures. He wrote his own textbook and all the material you need is in it. Aside from two star quizzes, the rest of the material is pretty dense, it is NOT an easy class, a lot of studying is necessary, but Charlesworth makes the class entertaining.", "Not the greatest presenter (kind of boring actually) but you do learn good basic computer application skills. He gives 3 exams and a final along with a computer assignment from each software as well as a web page. It was very easy to make an A!", "Mr Verdi's opening questions were always brilliant - case in point - his opening question for the Illiad: \"Why are these men fighting?\" Along with Gisela Berns the best tutor in St. Johns. My only regrets at St. Johns: not choosing his Wittgenstein preceptorial and missing the chance to enroll in his Nietzsche Preceptorial. Ah.. St. Johns---!!!!!", "Bob is awesome, end of story. Take him and don't look back. Makes a tough subject easy. Lectures reflect the test directly.", "Nice guy, but not a good instructor. He is boring and has nothing interesting to say.

He allowed me to see depth in passages that I would never have seen myself. Excellent professor!", "Unfelpful? Are you crazy??? Well, if u want to sit back and not to do a thing then yes, he won't help. Prof Boyle knows his subject very well, encourages u to write better than average undegrad. student and he does a good job helping u to get to that level. Only those who are lazy can say such a thing about their belly-button lint.", "Dr. Bakker is a very tough teacher but he knows what he is talking about and will prepare you well for future classes if you put the work in. All the basics for the tests are in the powerpoints but in order to do well you need to do a lot of practice problems. Definitely don't take if you're just taking for a science elective.", "Took him for physics in sports many years ago, and he was HORRIBLE. Absolutely horrible. How I wound up with a B in there was this: I taught myself, and got my hands on a practice exam. Outside of that, he was useless then.", "Professor Bloom is the best. He's so helpful and wonderful.

Those who react badly to him must just be superficial or lazy.", "This post is for those students who are serious about math. If you can take a 300 level course with him do so!

I would recommend him for any class since Dr. Ibrahim i very helpful and will try to give real life examples to chemistry problems.", "While it was evident that Professor Amrine knew his subject, his lectures were dry and didn't seem to pertain to the material that was on the final. The final should have been easy, as it was a take-home essay, it really was difficult to know what he expected.", "The homework is like 100 pages long, and you never understand what he's saying. There's no point in going to class.", "Really cares about his students. Great practical advice for journalism students, not just photojournalism. One of the best professors I've had at NYU.", "The class consists of him standing at the front working out examples. He never explains what he is doing or why, and it is super confusing. Combine this with a large lecture hall, his horrible handwriting, & thick accent and the lecture is incomprehensible. The grade you receive is based on 10 online pop quizzes & online test during lecture period.", "He's a very wise guy with a lot of studying not only on his teaching area but in general. Will make you study a lot and lots of non related readings. Exams are easy as long as you do the study guide, will make you work hard for your grade, but if learning is your thing it should be worth it.", "Charasmatic? Yes. Interesting? Yes. Weird/eccentric/outside-of-the-box? Most definitely. In my opinion, though, that's exactly what makes this class worth taking. Very important to keep up with reading, attending discussion sections, and also asking him questions/simply talking with him after class. Professor that truly cares.", "Pros:Always prepared, explains things clearly, well thoughtout powerpoints, clear detailed assignment handouts, spends more time helping students more than office hours require, you will learn alot Cons: Not objective in grading, unreasonably picky, assigns busy work, picks favorite students, dominates convo, you might not get the grade you deserve", "This is not a traditional science class by any means, in fact, it's a great class for non sciencey people who need a science credit. But it is definitely Grobstein's element. Other people complain about his philosophizing but that is exactly what this class is about so it was perfect. Fun, interesting class.", "The most boring class ever. He goes too fast when lecturing and he grades harshly. He did curve our tests however which helped. Study a lot and try to keep up on reading. Pretty nice to me, just be nice back and try.", "John is an amazing lecturer, his tangents are hilarious and usually relate back to the point. This class was actually super interesting; if you care about business in the slightest, learning about its history in America is pretty tight. TA was trash but the class was awesome. It was graded on two essays but the prompts are given months ahead.", "Mr. O'Connell really knows his stuff,he expects a lot but he is worth it, he's also like 45 years old but looks 25 he's mad hot!!!!", "Rambles on and on and on about the most random things....tests are ridiculously hard.

I had him for two of my courses. His lectures are delivered as if in theatre so you cannot possibly fall asleep in class :)", "No Comments", "very easy professor,as long as you do your work, go to the class, you will do fine on the test. He gives you answer before the final,and he also give take-home quiz. very chill and experienced!", "This professor was so nice and intresting at first... he goes off on tangents bragging about family, its annoying. you have to have pretty much perfect attendance, he takes lateness very personally. somewhat condescending.", "Everyone has that one college professor. Dr. Ruckh is that professor. He makes you think critically, and while you will be over your head at times, you'll learn how to swim and it will be so rewarding.

Lots of work but very easy.", "boring class. worthless assignments. the ta's this semester were truly awful. they were total jerks. one said he wouldn't care if your mother died and would still make you take the mid-term or turn in your paper. ridiculous. there should be a little compassion in this world.", "Ask him a question, he'll always answer. He explains complex theories in ways you can understand, he's understanding if you're strugglingcan't turn something in on time. He's hilarious, and he's the best!", "The class needs a complete upgrade from the way information is given. The lectures are very heavy and dry with plenty of terms and functions being explained in a short amount of time. Beneski does not give study guides, test reviews, worksheets, or any practice work to help you before the exams. He flys through info; most students rely on tutors.", "New teacher. Can tell he has never taught before. Needs to slow down a lot. Pretty easy grader though.", "He definitely knows his Shakespeare and he'll definitely make it interesting, even for the uninterested. A few essays, nothing too crazy. You watch a lot of the movie versions, which is good by my book. Recommended!", "Dr. Ballard has a dry sense of humor so he's sorta funny. Has a lot of class discussion and always plays devil's advocate! Tests are way too hard and he's a tough grader on articles.", "I took WHP310 as an online class with Rorke. He definitely knows his stuff. I would say he is not the most approachable or understanding professor. His class is very interesting though. All online exams are only open for a short window of time. Be prepared! Not an easy A, study for exams even though they are open notes.", "Nice guy. Very excited about class but boring at times.", "Prof. Jones is an excellent, passionate classical guitar teacher. He teaches music theory so you understand it too. His class is for CLASSICAL guitar, so be serious and open to this method. He knows what he is talking about and there is a reason why you must do it as instructed, it will all make sense when you advance to the more elaborate pieces.", "I like him as a friend but as a director/ teacher he sucks ass and has no tact. But he is a sweet man who thinks of his students as his children when he's not directing them. The YELLOW JACKET IS MINE!!!", "extremely intelligent with valuable insight, understanding, lisitens to students and actually takes their opinions ect.. into accout, very thought provoking, basically the antithesis of switzer", "I personally do not care for this professor because of his teaching style. He only gives grades on quizzes and exams so if you don't do well on those then you can't really redeem yourself. His homework isn't required to turn in but recommended for practice. He is a very tough grader!", "This class kept me going through the physics major. He made it so fun, and helped us all to understand so well. He cares about his students so thoroughly, and works so hard to help his students want to learn and succeed.", "No Comments", "Dr. Kuhlman is the best teacher in the chemistry department. Students will fight to get his class during registration. He is very helpful outside of class and explains his logic very clearly. However he places a lot of class percentage on tests.", "I loved David's class. Ancient history usually isn't my thing, but he found subjects that could spark students interest. He is very supportive of his students, and occasionally goes on little rants about how WE are in charge of our education, not the other way around, and actually told us to come here to do research on our professors. Really great!", "This professor is great.He will teach you a lot about the subject. He is a hard grader, so pay attention and do the HW. he doesn't grade it, but its help-full. his assignments are short and his test are hard. take home quizzes too.", "Fun Teacher but i found that he isnt always clear in what he was teaching and doesnt always give a straight answer but the class was fun.", "Chaney was awesome! He really cared about his students and was very encouraging, even of films that other teachers may not have supported so much. He was also just a really cool guy and gave great projects.", "He's really into books. A little eccentric, but a great professor. He's all about the deeper meaning in books so be ready to actually do the reading - cliff and spark notes won't help you in his class. He's a tough grader - especially on essays, but take solace in the fact that he lets you know what he wants so it shouldn't be a surprise.", "No Comments", "Pretty clear class. He wants what he wants, but gives you feedback on drafts in class and spends a lot of times making sure you understand stuff.", "He is a good guy, I think he is just misunderstood. I am unsure about the grading, I am hoping not to get low balled with an A- because it will kill my 4.0. He takes fractions of points off of things which seems unfair. It should be right or wrong, there is no way to know the exact answer he is looking for. I'm biting my nails hoping for the best!", "I'm not a major, but I've always loved music, and Dr. D reawakened my love for choir. He really cares about his singers, just be ready for quartets, and remember it's not the end of the world if you have to go in for re-sings.", "Best teacher I ever had.", "Critelli is out of this WORLD. He'll make you laugh so hard you can't breathe. Critelli will go over the material over and over but in different hilarious ways.

I would definitly take him again.", "No Comments", "Great teacher had a lot of fun", "adult development is seriously a wonderful class. i wish i had enough time to take all his classes!", "Extremely boring and dry. Period.", "Haynie is awesome. He can get boring in class if you are not interested in what he is talking about. He is very focused on his teaching. Everyone else saying that his tests are his study guides...they are absolutly right. Getting an A in his class is easy if you show up.", "You will learn a lot.", "What can I say about Robidoux? The guy really has no idea what hes doing. He comes to class incredibly disorganized, and wastes our time teaching useless proofs. He actually has to get the students to point out his mistakes, otherwise the stuff he teaches would be completely wrong.", "Very good teacher. Knows his stuff. Must show up to class. Don't be late, he's not fond of that. If you're going to miss a class, let him know. Uses email ALOT so check it often. Definitely do the readings or you'll be lost in class.", "Very interesting and enjoyable class and teacher. He does everything he can to be helpful, but you have to attend and study every week! Highly recommended for serious students.", "He is such great teacher, very strong science background, very helpfull. He is extremely clear in explain the material. I had him for low level class, but I wish to had for a higher one, but he is the best. He is the king of sciences", "Good teacher--very fair and impartial. Uber smart, he knows everything about the subject. Very nice, too.", "Great prof. He really made me think about life and how I think about things. He challenged me to venture outside the box and question what I believe and why as objectively as I could. Really showed me how closed-minded I was. This class is a must for first years. Essays aren't hard. Just incorporate what he talks about in lecture. READ THE BOOKS!", "Dullard, dullsville, dull.", "I highly recommend this online class it is pretty clear and easy A. Do the work and you will get the grade. Prof suggested to get mylab but didn't use it at all. the discussions req. are clear and easy. The prof is understanding and works with you on anything without out double questioning. Awesome Teacher! for being online.", "This was a very difficult class to take as a freshman.

Tests were difficult but he has a pretty nice grading scale, so it evens out a bit.", "No Comments", "He is a nice professor and its a very easy class", "This class was 10% history, 50% intellectual thought, and 40% philosophy. There is a reason his classes never fill up and 50% of the class drops on week two. You would think your in a PhD program and not HIST 111. Any other teacher is an easy A with effort. You will not get an A in this class.", "hes the man", "Best Teacher Ever! He's hilarious in class and really has a passion for teaching.

Take him you won't regret it.", "always late, missed 4 out of 15 classes. his lectures are useless, do not take notes but he takes roll sometimes so attendance does count. keep your papers that he hands back, he loses them and you get no grade for it. read the book and you'll be fine, pretty easy A", "I know he seems intimidating. It's easy. The key to this class is to do the work. People don't come to class prepare (ie do the readings) and then expect him to teach all the basics. It's simple. Do the work before class, challenge yourself by extra problems, ask the tutor if you have questions and you'll do fine.", "Pretty easy, doesnt post grades at all though. he doesnt believe in using much technology. no homework really except studying and the workbooks which he helps out with", "Dr. Rahimzadeh is intimidating at first and yes, he's arrogant. But he has every right to be. He has such a strong grasp of early English literature and his lectures immediately pull you in. Brilliant and passionate and very funny. After a few weeks you realize he's so sweet too. And his clothes are cuter than anybody else's in class. A plus.", "Not a Great prof for LART class. The class is required and not very interesting to begin with. He takes it more seriously than most of the other professors and mostly talks the entire time.", "Jazz History was an awesome class! You don't need to know anything about music in order to get an A. He makes the class very interesting by bring his saxophone and allowing you to hear the differences between different types of Jazz. He only grades you on quizzes but he goes over every question the class before! Love this class and Paul!", "His class is boring and the homework has nothing to do with the papers. He is a very nice guy and will help you if you need it.", "He makes a great deal about being in class in order to pass, yet all he talks about in class is his poetry or his books or his columns on newspapers! He spends 85% of the class time bragging about the same things on a daily basis. How he got selected, how he was awarded! The bragging never ends! It amuses me how he manages to sneak it in everyday!", "His lectures are engaging. Best professor at Coastal. Prepares you for the exams by making the course fun and interesting.", "What a GREAT class! Dr. Fisher is a wonderful teacher and probably one of the most interesting and clear Biology teachers I've had at Saint Louis. If you have the chance to take him, make sure you do. Four tests total and online assignments which are optional. The tests can be tricky- so make sure that you study the material well.", "Do not take internet section with him. The course is easy especially if u have studied adms 3330. He does not gives any feedback about the assignments and mid terms. When I e-mailed him for his office hours twice, he never responded. Take this course in fall or winter i.e. a lecture. Avoid the internet section. Overall a bad experience for me.", "Not a great teacher and the accent doesn't help, but lets you know what to expect on exams and the final. He's the one to take for fluids. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you have to go in order to turn in HW (5% of your grade) that's due every lecture.", "mixes up of materials and mediums used to express material...he's absolutely fabulous & attentive to the needs of the students...workload is just right and he provides support that is necessary through out the class...he asks in the middle of the lecture if everything makes sense and provides time questions...best professor at smith hands down!", "He has an extremely dry wit, so if you do, then you'll find him really interesting and funny. If you don't, you'll probably be bored to tears. But his courses are pretty easy, usually take home exams or essays. If you go to class and do your work nominally well, you should get at least a B.", "As long as you keep up with the assignments and the labs you will do great. He's also very generous with marks and insists on learning everyone's names. Overall a great prof and a great course", "No Comments", "Just look at the powerpoints he posts on BeachBoard, and you'll be okay for his exams. Rarely used the books; he lectures/plays a video during classes. He does care about his students, so don't be afraid to ask him anything. He tends to give the same grade you get on your first exam on the rest of your exams, so do well on it.", "Research is key to good grade. Make sure to show up, be on time, and take notes as best you can. He loves class participation and questions and is very accessible via email and office hours. He didn't assign much in textbook, but if you take the time to read the related chapters, you will have a solid advantage.", "Absolutely fantastic professor. Extremely knowledgeable and interesting while still remaining accessible to students. Class material is conceptually difficult, but very rewarding if you immerse yourself in it. He also grades relatively generously. Overall a smart and kind man who is passionate about what he does and has a real talent for teaching.", "This guy is the worst. He makes all the students rewrite. Nova made a bad choice. No wonder why hes at a different college every year.", "The best math teacher I've ever had. He is so good at explaining things, it's really easy to understand what he's talking about.", "I don't know what people are talking about. Prof. Grobstein is one of the best professors I've ever had in my life. If you really want to learn something, take his class.

He's the man - he makes learning fun and interesting - take h1s class", "Dr. Wolf is the best teacher I have had this semester at PSC. His lectures are always so interesting. He encourages you to be bold, say what you feel, and have an opinion. He is so smart,funny and awesome. I will take him whenever I can in my other classes. Don't buy a book, the class is mostly just class discussions. ENJOY :)", "Awesome professor. He is very smart but he plays dumb with the students. He is very laid back and wants to help the students out. Take his class, you will have a joke of the day before he begins his lectures. A lot of fun, I miss being in his class.", "He's a horrible lecturer and a poor class planner, but he?s honest when it comes to the art world outside the classroom. His teaching style isn't anti-woman, but definitely anti-feminist.", "alright guy... pretty boring class", "Everything is on WebAssign (homeworkquizzes) except for the midtermfinal so make sure to get it. The ebook comes with WebAssign so you don't really need the actual book. I fell a little behind in his class, but caught up and passed with an A. Good luck. He's really laid back and a great teacher! You won't regret taking him. :-D", "Good new guys!! I heard he's retiring! He is boring and useless. He has cancelled class about 6 times and does NOT notify us, I'm a commuter and he is not considerate at all to his students.", "awesome", "If this class had been for law students, and a full year it would have been fine.

Despite being an 8 AM, his class was super enjoyable. Such a fun guy all around. Take him!", "A really nice prof, but definitely expects you to work and practice hard. He seems to really understand everyone's level of commitment, and teaches accordingly. Only negative point is that he doesn't say too much, so you have to ask him if you want an a specific answer.", "Terrible lecturer. Disorganized. The Physics department is terrible, and he is apart of this mess. You'll never know what you're doing, and their terrible explanations won't help at all. Good luck! Also, they have no official textbook so good luck finding what you need to know!", "majority of grade based on essays", "This was the worst professor I have had in my entire college career. I am an A student and I have never been more frustrated and aggravated with a class or proffessor! He is a terrible lecturer and he drones on and on for three hours about nothing of importance but expects us to know everything come test time! His study guides were over 100 pages!", "For being a non-major Bio, he give too much information. Im an A/B student and im border line passing. Teaching for many years, he assumes that the majority of students already know the info, good for major in Bio. I do not recommend this teacher.", "I've taken Irv for 240 and 420.

Learned a lot from both classes, and received a 3.7 in both.", "Made us sit thru one of his CD recordings, a waste... Class was a waste, Ace'd the midterm and final, yet got a B grade due to the fact that I was always late about a half and hour, and class (Statistics for Engineering) did not have one single problem with the exception of the final, to due with engineering, a nice guy, but a real bore...", "NEVER TAKE THIS MAN, paper every Friday, tests are impossible, class averages about a 60 each test. Doesn't curve. Grades the papers unfairly and is very unclear as to what will be on the test.", "His classes were challenging and interesting.

When he is pleased, or when he finds something \"interesting,\" his face lights up.", "Great teacher.", "Great instructor!

He has high expectations of his students and challenges them to think for themselves, but is always there to help anyone who asks.", "Smartest. Prof. Ever. He and Dr. Stoops are literally the smartest people I have ever met. All his classes are great, be sure to take VERY good notes. People claim he's hard, but he really just doesn't take crap from dumb people. Great experience, highly reccommended!", "Open book, open note tests. Tells a lot of corny jokes but he's a good teacher. Make sure you don't drift off when he goes into one of his stories because he picks right back up into the lesson.", "Not a great professor for so many reasons. He teaches pretty clearly and seems like a nice guy, until it comes to academics... His grading is tough, and almost no one feels prepared for his tests. Worst thing by far: he calculates your grade 3 different ways, and TAKES THE LOWEST. Why? Does he want people to fail?", "terrible class. worries more about his book then teaching the class.", "Extremely difficult exams. They have nothing to do with the lectures and the wording is incredibly tricky. I would recommend taking this course with another professor.", "Prof's amazing. I've had this prof. for 2 classes now and they're wonderful, clear-cut, and pretty easy if you put in the work. There's 2 exams, 1 final, and 1 paper. If you get a grade that you're happy with on the first 2 exams, you don't have to take the final OR take the final and it will replace your lowest test grade. Awesome Prof.", "This man went out of his way to help his class learn. He really made biology understandable and he even made it relative to every day life. He drew everything out on the board and I thought that his lectures and labs were very colorful. Wonderful teacher!", "If you have barely any interest in the subject of psychology, i fully recommend taking his class for you will pass. He took most of the time in class to talk about his personal life. Barley uses the textbook. Two tests plus a final. Drops the lowest grade. He was so behind on teaching us, that he gave every student a 90 for the second exam.", "Dr. Bergeson is a great professor and lecturer. It was in a large class but still individualized it by letting students ask questions and help with examples. The lectures are based on enhancing the textbook reading, so if you read the book, you'll be great.", "He makes the difficult parts easier, u just have to pay attention on him!", "I took the web class. The class itself was very easy with online exams you can take as many times as you need. The only thing I hated was the final. Four essay questions at 250 words each and about 50 multiple choice. All based on previous test & paper. WAY too much to remember for a final.", "Professor Burge was a good teacher and makes it clear what is going to be on each test. There are a few out of class assignments that take a lot of effort to complete. Make sure you work hard in this class because Professor Burge has very high standards.", "Jim is a great teacher, Ive had him for 5 times as a teacher. If you dont like to draw or your a slacker dont take his class, youll be wasting his time as well as the other class mates. If your competitive and want to improve on your drawing then this his class. In my opinion, anyone who has gave a bad remark is full of it.", "Took the online course and would recommend this class to anyone who needs it. As long as you read your text, you will do fine. He gives weekly chapter quizzes and has four term papers to turn in. All unit exams are given online, so that makes it easy if you have a hard time going to campus. Study hard for his tests because they can be tricky.", "he sucks! his exams are very difficult and not clear. i took his class because of this website- what a mistake! if you want to study 100pg. of the textbook for his exams, then good, take him, but i would not recomend it!", "He will do everything to help you with anything. He is a super nice and funny guy.", "One of my favorite teachers. He always had the class laughing. There is a lot of thinking and writing involved in this class, but overall----VERY FUN! If you have to take SOC, take Ellis' class. You won't regret it!", "I enjoyed Sharif as he was great at communicating. Explains hard conceptsproofs for those who are more interested but doesn't require too much on tests. I highly recommend going to lecture and taking good notes and trying out the hw. HW is good practice for tests but is small part of grade. Gives good reviews for tests and allows formula sheets", "Best professor I have had at UNH. Interesting, entertaining, and always willing to help.", "Best Professor. He keeps you intrigued with his lectures. As long as you go to the lectures and seminars and put in an effort, this class will not be a problem to get a good mark. His exams are no surprise because he is crystal clear with what he wants you to know.", "Dr. Hupp is amazing! He cracks jokes in every lecture that are actually funny, his grading criteria for the paper is literally step-by-step, and I actually learned a lot in his class because his lectures are so engaging! Great choice for child psych!", "No Comments", "what is this guy talking about he teaches 101 like its an advanced course. I tried really really hard ended up doing ok, he's interesting when hes not talking about class material. He makes a lot of things seem like they are going to create armagedon strange guy", "Before I lament on the difficulty, I did receive an A in his class. The only way this is possible is if you study a great deal, don't wait until the last minute. Hint: his tests are harder than the final, but make sure you do as well as you can on them. If you're a nursing major, this class is a joke compared to 150, so his difficulty will help you", "Great Counselor", "Materials are always explained after the homework for that section is turned in.", "he was fun and a great teacher!", "He is completely and utterly horrible. He expects so much from the class, but does not help whatsoever, he expects his aide to help the whole time. He makes the rudest comments about people using their phones and even threatened the class about it. STAY FAR AWAY!", "Amazing teacher. A philosopher more than a business teacher.", "No Comments", "A very kind, thoughtful, helpful man with a passion for teaching, students, and astronomy. You will enjoy every minute of his classes.", "Mr Young is a great teacher. Unfortunately, i struggled with his class; but it is possible to pass his class. I'm sure i probably didn't try hard enough but if i can pass, so can you. There is a total of 4-5 tests, practice tests with each test and homework throughout the week. He also gives you extra credit for every test.", "Very Easy Class makes it fun", "really great teacher, he's very interested in the content he is teaching and is legitimately interested in his students and their learning. He enjoys getting to know his students and values content and concepts of writing over grammar. I hope to take another class with him.", "Lectures are interesting, his tests are very straightforward, and the homework is minimal. Great professor and if you show up to class, pay attention, and read the textbook, his class should be a breeze. No surprises with him.", "He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ok professor. Tests are ridiculously easy. Class was really boring to sit through (he just reads the notes). Attendance is extra credit. You have to write a paper, but he gives an example paper, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy. He is incredibly patronizing at times. Makes you feel stupid for asking questions.", "Professor Babula was very good at getting across a large ammount of information in a short period of time. I would recommend this class for any beginning Shakespeare students.", "I didn't listen when I was told not to take Sharif for Dynamics, and I wish I hadn't taken his class. The material isn't difficult, but he only uses online grading and it makes it really hard to do well in the class even if you understand the material. He also has a really thick accent and bad handwriting, lectures are difficult to understand.", "I did not learn very much in this particular class with Dr. Langley. We had daily assignments in which we repeated the same things over and over. There was a lot of information in our textbooks for the class that I would have enjoyed really going into, but we never did other than in class presentations. I did not like the way the class was taugh", "Not bad on grading, not the best at getting his point across, better than some but not the best.", "I really enjoyed taking this class. You have to do the readings but he is very clear with what will be in the exams regarding lecture and what wasn't covered in class. Interesting approach to adult development. He has 3 or 4 random days in which he will take attendance, I recommend going to all lectures regardless (they are very interesting).", "Every class I have taken from this guy has been exactly the same. He is the laziest teacher I've ever had. Super friendly and funny, but constantly talks out of his a**.", "The Lectures were very interesting after we got out of assembly language. Tests were somewhat unfair. The class was actually kinda fun to go to.", "I think Mark assumes that art students are here to paint/draw/whatever our asses off. Isn't that what you're here for? I don't know you tell me. Mark is the best professor I've had in the department. Positive, open-minded and helpful. He's pretty old school but he is extremely knowledgeable. If he doesn't like you... you must suck. Sorry.", "Mr. Potter is a great teacher even though that he's not easy. He only does midterm and finals. He also does class paper, attendance, and chapter presentations.", "No Comments", "Dr. L. will tell you everything you need to know, if you do the suggested homework you can definitely do well--you need the book for homework. This class is awesome.", "i didn't like how he was very nosey with my studying and too much on my ass about how im gettin my work done. I paid 2,000dollars for that class and ended up withdrawing because of the way his teaching style was.", "He is awful. His instructions are confusing. He gives very long exam reviews and then not of it is on the actual exam. You get a minute to answer each question on Exams and they are the majority of your grade.", "Professor Delamater is great! He is very tough but he makes you work hard and you learn a lot. This is not an easy A class, but if you think you are smart enough to read a book, you will have no problems.", "Professor Fox is a wonderful person and he is very intelligent. He knows what he's talking about although sometimes the lecture might be a bit boring because he just talk for an hour and occasionally show us images to demonstrate. But in general, very easy grader and exams are kind of easy too so this is the class to take if you want an easy A.", "One of the best in the department.", "He was AMAZINGGGGGGGG", "I loved this class. Velleman is excellent professor, perhaps the best I've had so far at Cornell. I had no experience with Statistics before his class, but his lectures and textbook were so clear. You can tell that he knows his concepts inside out and he's great at explaining them. I strongly recommend him.", "He is not interested in your commentary on the test or vague questions that leave other students looking for the Blackberry. Ask only questions that will help you or others understand the material and you will be fine. If you are interested in hearing yourself talk go somewhere else.", "BORING BORING BORING", "Boring lecture. He isn't too bad. But the scantron tests are VERY hard, alot of the multiple choices/answer are waay too similar to each other. I study ALOT and I am getting a D-C right now. NOT an easy A!!!", "not very impressive, frankly speaking", "Intermediate Russian (0030 & 0040) is definitely challenging. He expects a LOT from his students and the pace is pretty quick. You do most of the learning from the textbook & go over assigned work in class to clarify. Class is almost all in Russian. Requires a lot of studying, effort, homework every night, class participation.", "he rocks! no bull**** with him, but that's real life folks...really helpful but you have to keep pushing yourself...go dr. weigand!!! :)", "Class is fine, all notes on his website. Very clear about class information, Very few test really easy just review notes and your fine. He is a great teacher but if you have no sense of humor and don't like cussing or jokes don't take him, but I find him to be just fine. I would recommend taking him for any class, I am again next semester.", "Good guy and he can teach the subject, except he doesn't relate the work back to the business world. His assigned homeworks help you study for the tests and there are no surprises on the test.", "Dr. Bergeson is amazing! His lectures are entertaining as well as helpful. His tests are pretty tough though, they can have tricky questions, but mostly because they're not very many questions so if you miss a few you end up with a B or C on the test, which ends up dropping your grade. (95+ is an A).", "Great teacher, great class. Pretty interesting stuff. Very knowledgeable about the subject matter and I learned a lot. Good stuff here.", "No Comments", "Tests/quizzes require you to think the way he thinks, and sometimes it's quite difficult to see what he's getting at. He never uses the assigned text and his lecture slides are often unclear and loaded with mathematical jargon. He makes up for all this with a very generous grading scale that makes it almost impossible to get anything less than a B.", "No sympathy for students. Worthless teacher.", "crazy man", "Professor Lippy seems to be a brilliant individual, and he really knows the material. Professor Lippy, however, lacks the ability to communicate that material to his students. He is very difficult to deal with and tends to get angry easily.", "Lank was the most amazing, inspiring teacher I've ever had in my life. I thought this class would be boring, but it was so interesting. Lank really believes in his students, and has this tangible excitment that makes you want to better the world yourself. AMAZING prof!", "GREAT GUY BUY TOO ENERGENIC", "He needs to learn how to teach. He knows alot about his field, but has no skill of teaching. There are only 8 students in the class and he couldn't remember all of our names. He should go back to school and learn how to teach", "No Comments", "awesome guy", "I took both physiological psych and human neuropsych with Prof Kurylo and both classes were amazing. He is very sarcastic which makes the learning fun. Pay attention in class, read the assigned chapters and you should do well. Smart guy, take him.", "Very hard to understand, He also messes up example problems so there is no answer and really confuses you. If you get him, drop him.", "ensemble rocked, he gave us music that was a challenge and really pushed us musically. Jazz history is a cake walk if you only hold a minor interest. Amazing musician for a stiff morman. Doc is awesome", "You will have homework every day and his tests are extremely hard, but he curves grades generously and is very clear about what you need to do to get an A. Good class - you'll learn a lot and probably end up with an okay grade.", "I took him 15 years ago - and my biggest regret was not taking more courses with him. Yes a funny accent and at times goes on a bit - but brilliant, passionate and provoking.", "He is enthusiastic. He really made me become a better writer and a better reader. He is interesting and helpful.", "I would highly recommend for anyone to take him. Yes the class is easy and its hard to fail. His lectures were very interesting, especially for a religion class and he is very understanding.", "Belittles his students. Appears nice, but he doesn't care about his students.", "He is by far my favorite teacher at MDC. His class is NOT easy. If you want an easy A do not take. But if you want a fair teacher who really knows about the subject or if you love oceanography take this class. He is a very nice person and is writing me a letter of recommendation. Got an A because I did all the work and studied.", "Great teacher- funny, down to earth, made the class very enjoyable and relatable. He wrote the book himself which made it very useful!", "Great teacher, lays thing out very clearly. EXTREMELY fair grader - goes by the syllabus. If you suck, you'll get a sucky grade. Study lots and be timely about the case study.", "Dr. Stecker's class is really hard to pay attention to because he talks very quietly and is not very engaging. He also grades pretty tough too, but its not a bad class.", "Good teacher. No HW or quizzes, just exams. Exams were difficult but open book. If you show up to lecture every day and ask questions it shouldnt be too hard. Also his grading rubric is VERY generous", "Very hard class. The material is very mundane and boring. I did not do well in this class and I attended lecture when I could (had 18 credits), read the material, and felt I did well on his tests but did horrible. TA was boring but enthusiastic. Corvino is very smart and loves his job but takes PHI too seriously. My worst grade in college thus far", "Worst professor I have had at Conn. hard to pay attention to, doesn't explain anything and expects us to understand right away. Problem sets are hard and graded hard. Do not take his class if you are interested in Econ, it is extremely frustrating", "Mr. Martin is very passionate about his career and it shows. He does offer extra credit which is very helpful. During the semester, you take 5 tests and he drops the lowest grade. Very nice man, and I do recommend him, but please take it serious, he is there for you.", "Incredible class. Ramin makes intro CS extremely interesting. While other CS100 classes were doing mind-numbing pointless programming assignments, we actually learned useful CS applications and picked up the programming as we went.", "Moved through material quickly but was really knowledgeable and explained key concepts well.", "Professor Stecker was very knowledagble about philosophy, however if you don't need to take the class don't take it. He gives you handouts with everything you need to know, but classes were very dry and boring. He had no clear scheduale and papers had no comments.", "VERY NICE AND EASY.. I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!", "This was a five-week class that I completed in three weeks with barely an effort. Exam questions are out of the textbook and the homework assignments give you instant feedback as to whether your answers are right or wrong. The instructor responded to questions through chat and was very generous with the extra credit that was available as an option.", "He's great, its not to exciting the class because he just sits there and lectures, but he's great and its easy to pass his class", "WARNING: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Dr. Wilson's class is too all over this place. His instructions are so unclear, he makes basic algebra seem like rocket science. he is very rude to his students at times. he doesn't care if you are on your phone. if you have to take him just show up, sit in the back and bring headphones.", "Very nice man. Fair grader, responsive to questions. At first I thought the class would be boring, but it was interesting. Do the study guides!", "Great sense of humor, keeps me awake while going through sometimes boring content. Also, wonderful nursing anecdotes that show the humane side of the profession. A very likeable and intelligent person and a great teacher.", "He is a really great teacher and if you put effort into the class you will do well.", "Im not sure if he still teaches, but this guy is a incredibly smart! He is a bit hard to understand but if you ask questions you will understand. He is a very reasonable guy. I despited a test grade, and he was very nice and open minded about it, and ended up changing it. He'll stay after class to help you too. I wish he tough more classes!", "Ridiculously easy class. He tells you what will be on the test as he lectures. He can be really condescending at times by talking to the class like they're 5-year-olds, but I guess he is just frustrated that a lot of people somehow manage to fail this class.", "Professor Dirks is a great and inspirational leader.", "Excellent professor. Very passionate about the subject and full of interesting information. Very friendly and approachable. This class was the bright spot in my otherwise awful schedule.", "No Comments", "This is the worst teacher I've had in my entire life. The work is all online so you can do it all from home. \"But what if I need to learn it in calss?\" Well don't bother, because he doesn't lecture. Just an absolutely horrible class.", "Very funny guy and the class isn't bad either.", "His lectures were all about theorems and never examples of problems. Like some one said before the average of the test was super low. Plus he was always late for class. The quarter was hell cause of this class.", "Definitely a course on the tougher side but I would take it again without thinking twice. The information is extremely interesting & his passion for it makes it so much better. You definitely need to set aside an hour a day to look over the information from the class before then you'll be golden. He is an amazing person and teacher don't miss out!", "Class itself is easy, but when it came to actually taking the tests, I didn't feel like we were prepared enough for the questions asked. However, he is a really fair grader and will give you the benefit of the doubt, so if you're on the right track you'll get most of the points.", "I took several of Mitchell Snays courses in 2011 and 2012, and still remember many of his lectures. Hands down the best teacher I had in my life. Challenging and passionate, he made my love of history endure.", "His tests are brutal! There is no point even going to class, he just picks the most obscure facts from the book and makes a test out of them.", "Horribly boring professor - he spends the whole class trying to find someone who isnt paying attention or doesnt know an answer so he can humiliate them. Also, he is very discourteous and continues to lecture 5 minutes after the class should have ended. The only way to get the guy to stop talking is to physically start packing up your books.", "No Comments", "Awsome guy. Very smart and passionate about the world. GIVES A TON OF EXTRA CREDIT. Impossible to fail with all the extra credit.", "He is very interesting.his study guides are what is on the test. His tests are mostly from notes! not multiple choice tests. all full-in and essay. NOT BAD THOUGH.know the study guide your in good shape.offers A LOT of extra credit.i recommend him!", "Enthusiastic and friendly.", "Dwayne can be a total jerk and I found him to be unreliable and disinterested in actually helping students. He tries to be intimidating but it's just laughable -- his giant ego doesn't live up to his imagined greatness.", "He teaches good philosophical ideals, but he does not follow them himself in the class discussions. He likes to cut people off before they can finish their sentence. He has some interesting concepts though and teaches the class well. There are only four graded papers composing 80% of your grade in the class. Dislike.", "Funny. Has a thorough knowledge and lectures with an inbiast opinion, especially on hot topics. I believe he's a pretty ideal professor.", "No Comments", "One of the best professors at FU. Not only is he a media god, but he's friendly and eager to help individual students as well. Classes with him are actually FUN, esp. the smaller classes, and many of his students sign up for the courses he teaches just because he's teaching them. Makes you work, but all the info's valuable. Has taught media execs.", "dr. critelli is the best professor i've ever had. lectures were fun to attend and you leave class feeling that you've actually learned something. i wish he taught more than just phil. 2 because i would take another one of his classes even though it has nothing to do with my major.", "Very helpful. Also very intelligent.", "Snider is very caring and uses humor to keep your attention. He wants to help you but you need to ask! His tests are hard but as long as you study you will do fine", "Dr. Gongaware is a really nice and funny guy! Swears a lot which can be entertaining. However, his lectures drag on FOREVER and seem scatterbrained at times. No offense to him, but I learned more from reading the textbook than listening in class. I found him hard to pay attention to a lot of the time and he can be unclear about assignments.", "This is the worst professor I've had in my entire college career. I am an A student but I've never been so frustrated. He drones for 3 hours about nothing but expects us you to know everything (plus stuff he hasn't covered come test time). He is not helpful and is arrogant! The study guides for tests are also over 100 pages with uncovered material!", "janz is a great teacher, his class made me so relaxed and he's a great guy. He is very interesting and his class is not hard. take hiM!", "Looking back at it, I loved this class! But he does get off topic and is a little confusing and eccentric. All his tests are take home and you can always go to the tutoring center for them but he has links online that will help you pass easily. He is an easy grader and really loves his students. If you get on his good side then you will love it!!", "Extremely careless about classes. Lecture notes are updated 1 month later (Those for the finals haven't been updated yet).", "Assigns homework (15-30 questions) for each chapter, offers extra credit on exams, gives study guides, trips to the planetarium. A good professor, very smart; sticks relatively close to the book but he may expound. Don't be lazy in the class and you'll do fine. Grading scale is averaged based on past class performances.", "He was my IUL prof freshman year and I don't think I could have asked for a better one! He let our class out 2 or 3 weeks early and only made us write one (one page) paper...which was NOTHING compared to some profs.", "This guy was meant to teach computers. He's been in the business for quite some time and knows the way things work. I wanted to take assembler with him put they had to cancel the class. In my opinion, he is the best instructor they have in the CIS department. I've only had 6 of them, but he's best", "I didn't realize the course would include a mandatory MLM presentation by a snake oil salesman for a product based on inaccurate nutrition information from a veterinarian. He pitches his other classes all the time and tries to bribe you to take them by offering extra credit in this course. He treats adults like children, and don't be late!", "I enjoyed his class. He is forgetful, and deadlines do jump out at you from nowhere, but he is fair. He listens to you, and if you need an extension, you got it. I love Dr. Milner.", "Glenn is really into computers and tries to instill this love of computers into everyone in the class. Lectures can be a little bor If sometimes but there is a lot of useful information that you can use in everyday life with your computer. If you show up, do Simnet training, and go to lab and put in a little effort it's an easy B/B+.", "Made class more enjoyable and made a rather complicated subject understandable. Has available office hours before class and is always willing to help. He is also one of the goofiest and funniest professors I've had!", "Great teacher, was able to learn. They provide labs that you need to do. Do those and you can basically pass.", "Great Professor; He explains the subject matter very well.", "This teacher is very helpful! If you have a chance to pick your professor he is great!", "Nice guy but I'm not a big fan of the class.", "No Comments", "ok so attendence not manditory notes not worth much, def mostly all about the txt book. 3 tests and optional paper, tests with LONG questions and are confusing, after the 1st test u see what 2 expect but def confusing q's.

We had to maintain an online blog, aside from his weekly quizzes.", "Professor Cherry was a great professor. Although he was hard of hearing, he consistently did his best to get everyone involved in class. It is unfortunate that he is retiring to become a surf instructor in California as he will be missed by the entire Villanova community.", "He is the best. His lectures were always interesting, and his assignments were very creative. The term paper assignment was excellent and included a perfectly selected film, which made it very enjoyable. I'll definitely miss his class.", "The worst experience I have ever encountered with a professor. He NEVER answered my emails, or questions. He waited until the last possible minute to upload or grade anything, meanwhile his folders were stocked with files that dated back to 2012. Most unorganized class ever, and so unhelpful.", "Physics is a really hard course because of the department. I don't usually rate my professors, but even though this class was so hard for me, cuz I'm no physics major, he really is one of the greatest professors. He cares about his students. He's brillant He's definitely worth taking the class from. He'll put in extra time outside of lecture!!", "Class is structured to get an A. However some folks are lazy and expect to earn an A from your effort. The tests are taken at the students convience in testing center. Most classmates will wait until you take the test and try to borrow your graded scantron and cheat off your efforts. Part of grade is attendance", "I had Prof. Handschuh for Photojournalism almost nine years ago. I'm now working full time as a journalist and looking back at his class, I realized:1-He told and taught us things that NO other professor in ANY journalism class brought up for discussion and2-He was spot on, 100 percent RIGHT on his assessment of Journalism as a career.THANKS David", "He's a great professor, but getting an A is rare. If you're interested in history and do well in it, I recommend taking him. He lectures well and isn't boring. But if you hate history and you're just trying to get by your gen ed, don't. His grading will affect your GPA. He doesn't grade unfairly, he just grades hard. There's a difference.", "This class is going to be the death of me.", "best prof ever.", "Dr. Fisher is super chill guy and his lectures are easy to pay attention. However, his tests are super detail oriented and have lots of small things. All in all though, I would definitely take his class again.", "Very kind man and helpful.", "HORRIBLE. Cannot teach. Yells at students and constantly belittles the class by comparing us to his chinese students. He did NOT curve for our class but compensated(since the class average is an F) by giving us free points. Either way, did not learn anything. STAY AWAY from this professor.", "Best Teacher", "Gerald Ludwig is my favorite accounting professor. He is very nice and very fair with grades, and he makes tests not too difficult. He assigns extra credit and homework assignments that are hard not to get 10/10 on.

I am a straight A student who got my first C because he was such a bad professor.", "LOVED HIM!!

Can't explain enough how much I loved him and his class.", "I had him my first year of college and he made it SO interesting. He is honestly a GREAT professor.

The teaches were easy as well, not mention kinda fun!", "the proverbial one trick pony. typical never built a thing professor.ask to see his work. its laughable...", "Incredibly challenging, very passionate, and expects a great deal from his students. Not coincidentally, he is one of the best teachers I've ever met.", "Farmen is one of the best professors at this university. He pushed the envelope for our class and got us to really delve deep into our thoughts and gain so very much from his class. It was a great life experience and I would recommend him more than any other prof.

Class is an easy A", "No Comments", "If you're looking for an A, this was an easy class. But that's also because we had almost NO assignments, there were times he didn't show up, & material was irrelevant.

I was lucky to have him for two classes", "Prof. Vandergrift is an excellent professor.by that, i dont mean he's easy. its not him, its the students. it would always depend on you and only you. its a hard class c'mon now... but he's doing his share and its gonna be ok if you do your share too...people who are saying he's worst, are those that wants to get away with this class easily..", "No Comments", "Shane Bell was surprisingly cool. He cared about the class and his students, and he always wanted everyone to succeed. His classes were fun and engaging, and he did a lot of in-class activities that got everybody involved with the course material. If there was ever a problem, Shane was always willing to help in any way he could. Very awesome.", "Effective command of material and can teach well, class is also enjoyable with in class experiments.", "This guy is awful. He insults people in class and makes a fuss if anyone asks him to work a problem. Has clicker questions every class period and only gives half credit to wrong answers, even though it's an attendance grade. Tests were ridiculously difficult, and he never curved, even though test averages were in the 50s. Rudest prof I've ever had.", "Fantastic guy and great christian. the material that he teaches might not be the easiest but he will make sure you get through it if you try and show up to class.", "Favorite professor ever. Took his class for GE and it blew my mind. Those who do not like hard work should stay away, there are plenty of classes you can take and sleep through. If all my classes had been as challenging and thought provoking as the one class I took with Coleman, my college years would have been amazing. Bravo!", "Conti was such an amazing professor because he attacks the real problems of the world and allows us to break those barriers in class. In the 2 hours I had him a weak because I took a hybrid, I learned about current events, how to write, and general knowledge I need to succeed in life. Conti was a life-changing professor.", "Definitely avoid at all costs. I had heard all the terrible things about him and wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but it's all true. You won't pass if you don't give him PRECISELY what he wants to see.", "Gives you a lot of chances to get a good grade by allowing you to rewrite papers or do community service for points; however, tests are rather difficult and are about a bazillion readings so make sure you know the facts from them", "Real immature professor. I mean it's gym so it's an easy class, but it feels like high school and he's a **** about attendance. Take someone else if possible", "He may seem a bit off topic and pointless at times but he truely is a proffessor that lets the class do the teaching - he guides the conversations and discussions at times - at times does not - if the people are good, the class is good - if not, well, don't blame the professor - just read the book, do the assignments and participate in class.", "TAKE HIM IF POSSIBLE!!! I loved his class and learned so much. Only 5 grades though, all 4 exams and 1 paper, so study!! But material was explained throughly and in a way youll remember!", "Extremely nice prof who knows what he is talking about but not an organized or interesting class. I was excited because I have an interest in astronomy but the class is completely dull and a bit of a downer. The assignment are tedious and do not promote learning at all. The testing is adequate if you have time to read the entire textbook.", "Very confusing man, doesn't seem familiar with the topics or how to explain them. Overall, not a great instructor for electrotech", "The 199 courses are great for breath requirements, and this course was no exception. It was a very fun course. There were only a few papers and one take home test. As long as you gave a solid effort on each assignment it was not hard to get a high mark. The material of the course is also very eye opening.", "No Comments", "Possibly the best class I ever had", "I strongly recommend Dr. Giarratani; he is a master economist. He lectures from the book, but he does a fabulous job of explaining the material. He also puts his lecture slides online. The non-mandatory homework and readings are important for the tests. His tests are reasonable, and it is easy to do well if you understand the material.", "He's very knowledgeable but all over the place. It didnt' help that he wrote the book. The only real study group I had in undergrad, and that was so we could teach the material to ourselves. He's smart, but I don't feel like he can convey the material. His tests are also difficult, but fair.", "Andrew Katz is a saint. He is hands down Denison's greatest asset and greatest professor. Do yourself a favor and take one of his classes. He'll make the subject matter more interesting than you ever thought possible. Sometimes you're a nut, sometimes your not. Cheers to you, Andy.", "labs were ok, not hard, but not boring either always kept me busy", "As a student that usually struggles with math, Professor Young was great. I took him online, he makes instructional videos for every lesson that are a huge help. You can tell that he genuinely loves math and he explains it in a way that's easy for anyone to understand.", "Dr. Reardon is an amazing teacher who is very passionate about his work and the success of his students. Strongly encouraged classroom participation. Get your work done on time, he doesn't allow late credit.", "Super interesting man, super interesting class. It was my first Anthropology class, and I learned so much. He is really knowledgeable and has the coolest stories to tell. There is only a midterm and a final, so it isnt that hard of a class at all.", "boring, easy A", "Great teacher! Everything he tests on is in his lectures that he has for you on his website. Extremely helpful and has the best interest in the students. If you make the effort he will go the extra mile for you! Some of the information is a bit dry but if you put in the time you will learn so much! Seriously awesome teacher. Tough class though :)", "He is an amazing teacher and so understanding. I'm not an art major & didn't know anything about art or how to draw. He helped me so much. I ended up getting an A because he saw how hard I tried although my work wasn't as good as the others. I enjoyed his class. You need to be very neat he's picky. Be prepared to spend a lot of money on materials.", "HE IS SO ANAL...GO BACK TO BOSTON...WE DONT NEED U...UR SUPPOSED TO BE A TEACHER...YET WE ARE NOT LEARING ANYTHING...MAN U DONT HAVE PASSION IN WHT U DO...I THINK U SHOULD RETIRE...OR REBORN", "Please drop the class bcz I have no words.", "Professor Reed, and his lectures, are very monotone, dry and boring. I only went to class twice outside of the tests (which are essays) and still received an A. Going to class and buying the book are not necessary at all. But going to the TA sessions the days before the tests are CRUCIAL to passing. They go over exactly what you should write.", "The Man is bored with what he teaches. I love him as a Prof he pushes those who need to be pushed.", "is a good teacher", "He is not clear at all. He asks for your questions but does not respond well to them. He goes off on tangents that do not seem to relate to the point and some how you are supposed to make a connection. It is time for him to retire.", "Mr. Morucci is a great guy. He's a little outspoken on politics, but other than that, he's a great teacher. He explains things very clear and in detail. He really helped me understand the material.", "pay attention to the lectures because you will have a lecture test every two weeks in the lab and make sure to do the trainings online or you won't pass. If you study a little you can easily get a b in the class.", "Fantastic professor. Had him for several classes. If there were more profs like Jon, I'd have a PhD!", "He was an awesome professor. This class is very easy and the only way to fail by not doing your work. He gives you the grading policy and he is also very helpful and he even let you out of class early. if you want to take an easy class he is definitely the professor to have.", "Very easy class, he e-mails all the notes and the tests are all multiple choice. He doesn't make class very interesting, but it is an easy A.", "Great Professor, Three tests, all Easy, one paper, real simple. always willing to help you out, Great in every aspect!!!", "C'est un professeur qui n'endort pas. Les exemples qu'ils donnent sont tout ce qu'il y a \u00c3\u00a0 retenir pour r\u00c3\u00a9ussir les examens...", "Nice,smart professor.However the class is a joke.He does not cover the material in the text. It is almost impossible to stay awake when he is speaking.If you are a motivated student you can do well. If you are not, stay away from this course.", "How can you hate him? Lots of extra bonus points and he recycles his questions. He really tries his best to keep the class entertained. I believe he wants the best for his students but his teaching technique isnt really the best. Make sure you try to understand the content before class and his teaching supplements whatever youve got. Go for DGDs", "Boring! Good thing I had this class! NOT! Do I get a refund? Dont laugh--wait till drug lit.--u will wish u paid attention! But do we really have to go thru it twice!", "This professor gets your attention on what college is about. If you go into any med or science field, you need to take this guy. He will prepare you for MCATS, VCATS, PCATS. I would highly recommend this guy if you are going this route. Or even nursing. If you want a science for the hell of it, take someone else. I aced my bio part on my pcat", "Hard to follow sometimes, but he's always willing to help as best he can.", "I took the online summer option for this class. Be prepared to work hard listen to lectures and read the textbook. But if you do that you will pass. His test are fair. If you are self motivated then this is a good class for you.", "He is one of the worst prof. at UCI!! He speeds thru lecture notes and doesnt explain anything, the book was the only thing that helped me pass the class, it is pointless to go to lecture because he goes so fast you wont be able to write anything. I did not like him at all. Try to avoid taking this class. It takes alot of time and energy.", "Great guy, really cares about his students. Stick to the Biochem notes and you'll do fine. He curves so most people can pass with a C, but if you cant get at least a B- in his classes, you need to become a Business major. Attend lecture because he often cuts lots of material to study.", "He was a very easygoing professor, and very fair. He was always willing to work with the students, especially if they weren't doing well. If you show up to class, and you have decent writing ability, you'll be fine. If you can't write, avoid the class. He was also very clear about what he would ask on his exams. If you do the work, you'll get an A.", "He is all over the place and it is very difficult to tell where he is at in the lecture so you can't really keep up. Would not recommend to ANYONE. The ONLY good thing about him is that he gives a little extra credit.", "Xenophobic, self-centred, proud of himself whereas he's considered by his peers as a martian who is more interested by his glory than the success of his students.", "Dr. Kent is my favorite teacher. He is very thorough and tells you everything you need to know. Studying is a MUST for this class! Especially for the essay questions, but he gives study guides that literally has EVERYTHING on it you will need. So helpful, always made time if I didn't understand something. Also gives amazing extra credit.", "Jim is one if the greatest professors I have ever met! a true mensch. he cares deeply about theatre so much so that even if you have a limited knowledge of theatre he engages you to constantly do more to grow! your knowledge is fed by the true genius of the mans knowledge. he invites the best of the best to come in to do workshops! take his classes", "Despite the fact that his class is pretty easy, it's all really neat stuff you learn. This class is definitely worthwhile.", "not the best", "awsome guy", "his \"practice programming\" parts of his lecture will be on the commons. hes very nice and explains things to detail. take if you have no clue about c++", "I took him for an FYS and I thought he was really funny!

Rinse out Prof. J-Mack propa...gunshots! boh! boh! maximum Reeespect....", "Very enthusiastic teacher, very fun and exciting class... had some very unique and original projects for the class.", "Kinda boring with all his powerpoints. He does know his stuff very well. His test are kinda hard and the project is just annoying.", "I studied more for this one class than all my classes combined and I am a pharmacy major. I received the highest grades on the midterm and final out of 12 people in the class and he still gave me a B! how does anyone get an A? Im glad I heard he left or hopefully fired. He does not care about the students, yet about boosting his ego.", "ONE OF THE WORST PROFESSORS I'VE EVER TAKEN AT CSULB. Uses Powerpoints from 5 years ago. Lectures are completely useless. Counts attendance but there's no point in attending class. Study the book for the tests because his Powerpoints don't explain anything since he's probably using them for 5 different classes. Cancels class a lot...", "Great prof.!", "If I could marry one Slippery Rock professor, it would be Dr. Lynn!!!", "The class itself is easy considering that there are only two tests and Dr. Zeman gives you study guides, although they are long, that lay out word-for-word exactly what you have to know. Attendance/participation are absolutely mandatory, but Zeman is super friendly and lays out everything clearly and is very receptive to questions.", "He is probably the funniest teacher ever. Does a great job explaining concepts, but doesn't take too well to questions. He has a low tolerance for self-explanatory questions because he expects highly from people in Calc II, but it is definitely worth taking. Especially from Jay Ko.", "Awesome teacher. Very interesting class. No tests except a take home final. Weekly quizzes but they are straight from the notes.", "Worst prof ever. Be prepared to learn everything on your own because he doesn't teach in class. I felt like I was in high school all over again trying to copy his notes from the projector. Avoid at all costs!", "I took Mr. Young for College Trigonometry. You can tell right away that he really loves math and he really loves teaching. Trigonometry isn't easy for a lot of students but he really tries his best to explain everything as best he can. I've now moved on to Calculus and the fundamentals he taught are helping out a ton!", "I was expecting this class to be easy, it is not. This is a lecture class, you can expect to have a reading assigned every singe class period and half the time he unclear about what needs to be read. I had multiple quizzes, where the questions were irrelevant to the story that was read. I have to take this class again with a different prof. now", "Theres really nothing wrong with him. He does teach concepts, not plug-and-chug. You can get an A if you just know 2 of formulas covered going in to the exam. He has a lot of cool demonstrations and relates material to real life situations that he uses his free time researching for us.", "A great prof and person overall. Tests are always reasonable and to the point. Lectures were always interesting and he even uploads the audio of his lectures which is a GREAT help to auditory listeners!!", "if you have to take a class in mgmt, this is it, everything else is honestly hell - david way to go! if life was a cupcakes, DAVID'S THE FROSTING!", "What ever you do, DO NOT take this class! Prof. Douglass is so unbelievably rude, does not care about his students and acts like it is such an inconvenience if you ask him a question. Does not respond to emails and doesn't make Black Board available. BORING lectures. 4 quizzes plus midterm and final. Read the book if you want a chance in passing.", "Nielson's class was great. Assingments wern't too hard and had very clear due dates. The class atmosphere was laid back. Nielson's knowledge of the subject is pretty vast and he makes it easy for one to learn a lot.", "Excellent teacher. Very engaging. Demands that you learn and contribute to the class. Had a lot of fun and learned a lot. Very personable and professional.", "He's good professor..", "He's a good teacher. Class is somewhat boring just listening to his notes, but the class is easy. we only had one paper, three exams. the exams are kind of hard but he makes it very clear what you need to know. im taking him again next semester because i really liked the class", "All these people have only been talking about the lectures...but they didnt mention the exams and paper. This course is too much for a 1st year course. Alot of work and little return.Sometimes they ask you the smallest thing that was covered in the lectures. No body cares about students because there are too many of them. A tells you to ask B and B", "lOVE THIS GUY!!!", "Easy teacher and very helpful. He gives you points for attendance along with point for group discussions, which occur pretty much every class meeting. His office is alwayas open if you need to speak with.", "i actually liked vanantwerp this semester, despite all of the bad things i heard before. what everyone's got to know is that 209 is a tough class... but that doesn't mean the professor is bad. i thought he was a funny guy who really made the class fun. however his lab helpfulness could be questioned", "First two readings were hard, rest was pretty easy. Actually pretty interesting.", "His classes are work intensive, he takes the either learn the material, or fail the class approach.", "This course is time consuming and difficult, but that's the nature of the course content. After you're done all the projects you feel a sense of real accomplishment. Arvo delivers the subj. in sizeable chunks that are easy to digest. He understands the inadequacy of some student's background and accomodates. Best professor period; rewarding course.", "Professor Babula is darling. Just because he is such an adorable little man, don't be fooled. He knows his Shakespeare and you will too after you take his course. Very sharp, funny, seems a little shy, fair grader, makes Shakespeare come alive. I can't imagine anyone not liking him or his class.", "In my opinion, this class was not difficult at all as long as you actually studied and prepared well for his iClicker quizzes. His test questions are very direct and fair. You don't need to buy his textbook, just his lecture book so that you can write notes in it. Yes he does have strict rules, but he's very funny and makes lectures entertaining.", "Great teacher. Kind of rude at points, but you will definitely know Chemistry by the end. He is hard but fair and makes you work for your grade. You don't get formula sheets for the test, but with enough practice they're fairly easy to remember. Take this guy if you can!", "Grades kinda hard, but if you put in the work you can do well. Very nice guy, but I might consider other professors for a history class.", "He is AWESOME!!!!!! He is very creative, very helpful and very knowledgeable. I have taken all the classes Mark teaches at GCC and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m extremely happy that I did so. If you are an art student, you will always have use fore everything you learn in his classes no matter if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Color Theory or Design class. His Color Theory class is just grate an", "No Comments", "great teacher!!! highly recommended", "Good professor. I had him for both Psych 101 and Psych Stats 201. He uses slides for everything so if you miss class you can just print out the slides and learn from that. Also if you print out the slides before class (like the night before), then you get to write down the other things he says more easily and that helps a lot. Highly recommend!", "Psych Stats is difficult, but having Professor Kozbelt alleviates some of the challenge. I love that he is VERY fair, VERY helpful & clear ! He is organized, knows what he is doing and makes everyone in the class feel like they can ask questions. Sitting in a lecture hall I was surprised when he remembered my name! Kozbelt is very professional!", "incredible, incredible, incredible. most talented, energetic, fun-loving, and inspiring men I've ever met.", "Dr. Rimes is an excellent professor. He follows a simple philosophy of jumping right into the subject matter. This teaching method provides for a better overall learning experience.", "He is easy,He is real laid back.A study guide for the exams is included in the syllabus.Right before the exams he will walk you through every question and he tells the answer to each one. You must right a little 2 paragraph paper on a current topic that he includes in the syllabus.In return for this he cancels class for a day. He is EXTERMELY EASY!", "Amazing professor. He's really soft spoken so he's hard to hear at times but he is extremely knowledgeable and is always willing to help. He re sparked an old interest for me.", "Horrible teacher. He seems passionate but it is about nothing. Hard to understand. I couldn't stand one and a half hours in a class with him. Worst lecturer I've ever had. He outright said Christianity and every faith is beautiful but wrong -- so derogatory.", "Too hard of a grader for a 101 class. GE grades, but follows Unno's guidelines and it's a bit ridiculous. I'm no straight A student, but I do well on essays and I got a grade I wasn't expecting. My GE later said it's hard to receive an A on essays in this class. Essays are a good part of the class. First test also included Q's about grammar? Why?", "He's an ok teacher. Not the best if you're looking for order and methods. He tends to freestyle and work different projects year round. He's an all around good person and a really tough grader. His group projects is what brought me down. Took a different class and have nearly aced it. Group projects BEWARE!", "He is very helpful and nice. He is clear + fair", "Hard marker and expects way too much.", "Zorn is one of my favorites! Wacky in all the right ways that makes coming to class worth your while. The reading is manageable, but the papers can be challenging and he grades pretty hard (all in the name to make you a better writer). But Zorn's always there for help. I learned a lot in his classes, and that is money well spent here at SCU.", "Tarkow is the best professor I've had at Mizzou. He's really funny and is very open to different ideas and interpretations. He is a relatively harsh grader, but if you do the work and pay attention in class, you should be fine.", "Nice guy. Hardass on participation and attendance but gives good quiz notes and prepares you well for projects.", "Dr. Peters is very smart and interested in student learning. structure of the class wasn't lecture the whole time and we got freedom to work at our own pace. He has you do a ton of readings at the beginning of the semester though and gets pretty mad if you don't do them. He's a good professor but pretty hard, especially for a lower level class.", "Nice and funny guy! make the materials easier and fun to learn!", "Good teacher, gives good advice on my work, but sometimes I feel like he needs to let my art be MY art. But other than that he's a great professor.", "Strong was one of my most favorite teachers. About half of my class dropped, but I feel it was due to laziness. If you are not a lazy student and you put the time in, you can guarantee an A or a B. I had a 3 month old baby, a job, and took this class. I worked my butt off and made a B with a lot of help from Mr . Strong. He is an amazing teacher.", "This guy is so into himself and thinks hes tough stuff. If you dont get involved 100% and go on remotes you are not liked. Favorites are clear in his classes.", "Just be a smartass right back to him and you'll get along fine.", "this guy didnt even bother showing up to the final exam. That shows how much he really cares about what happens on his final. He may have been good but its time to retire rather then pretend to be teaching. 100 tricky questions on the final exam is not enjoyable. Not showing up for the final cause of little rain is pathetic. Avoid him.", "This guy was probably the coolest professor EVER! He knows everything about everything. Completely a people person, he seemed to know interesting facts about very uninteresting facts, the best lectures ever that required you to really think outside of the box. If you go to his office hours and ask questions, he'll help you lots.", "Raymond is awesome. He's sweet and is very experienced in the fashion industry. He has lots of great stories to tell from his previous career experiences. He's pretty lenient during class but you wouldn't want to miss his class because he is so funny; his class is fun. He's also very cute; looks & personality! Definitely recommend him.", "DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! All his notes are word by word from the book. Not helpful at all. Assigns a lot of homework and then doesn't know how to answer questions about it.", "He knows so much and is such a nice guy that it is a shame he cannot relay the information to a class full of eager students. He has too much going on outside the classroom - studies, research, etc. Very meticulous grader.", "He is a very nice teacher, you can get an A if you pay close attention on what he is really asking you to make/design. This was a very fun and cool class.", "One of the best math teachers I've ever had. He runs through the problems in a logical order, and the homework is really similar to the exams. As long as you do the homework problems, the exams and quizzes will be really easy.", "Really hard class. It takes a gifted teacher to make macro interesting. Tony is not one of these gifted teachers", "No Comments", "Nice guy, good teacher and conducter.", "There was only one day the whole semester where I stayed awake the entire class time. My God he's BORING. Everything is based on the exams, no quizzes. Just a bunch of boring lectures and two exams. Go ahead and take the class if you like to be bored and actually plan on reading the text books.", "Teaches little, reads alot and goes on tangents. He is tough on grading. If he likes you (aka your attractive and is in his face alot and he learns your name) you should do well in his class.", "Way 2 much work for a 5 week summer course. Lecture Tests were way 2 hard & the reviews for them were massive. By the time U answer everything on the review you don't have to much time 2 study.

Tough professor but WONDERFUL!!!", "Best teacher every! Makes sure everyone understands before moving on. He the only math teacher I have had that made math seem fun.", "I loved his classes. They were interesting and despite what some people said, he really knows his stuff. The only complaint I have is that he didn't assign any reading, which made catching up with the book a little tough.", "Dr. Dukes is always available to help and shows genuine interest in your research topics. He explains complex things in a clear way, but you do have to pay attention so you know how to ask the right questions.

Judging from the other ratings, I was very lucky to get on his good side.", "excellent", "I found Dr. Eberts to a very helpful. Although at first he may seem hard to approach once you talk to him he is fine. His Second and Third year classes are much better than the first year ones as he is more interested in the subject he is teaching.", "He is the man. A little unfocused at times, but a great sports fan, and he will help you any way he can. He gave me a graduation present, now that is awesome. Plus he shows himself dancing at the end of the quarter.", "Camilo is probably the best teacher I will ever have in my college career. Yes, he pushes you, yes the work is hard, but this industry is hard. The work Camilo made me prepared me for what the industry will expect me to do. He is helpful, easy to talk to, and funny. I will miss Camilo when I go onto my next school. Take his classes!", "Dr. Rahimzadeh is such a great professor! Lectures are always interesting (but DO NOT MISS THEM, because they're on the test), and he is hilarious. I didn't think anyone could make early lit fun, but he does.

He is useless he makes fun of you when you screw up during a speech", "I would never take Dr. Talham again. Was out of town the two weeks before out first exam and the week before finals. Tests are very hard and he gives practice exams from 1993 and 2000 which are not helpful. Would recommend anyone else. Yeah hes a nice guy but thats about it. Would not recommend.", "I took his Psychology 203 class. He is really not such a great teacher. He is fun the class is somewhat enjoyable but he is completely unreasonable. He is absent a lot and is a terrible grader. It took me a little while to understand his system and what would be on the tests.

You will without a doubt learn a lot in this class.", "mean spirited old man- he should be an accountant", "Great professor who forces certain things to be memorized, all of which are actually useful. He also tests over the material in a clear and straightforward manner. His review sessions are not a waste of time-he actually cares that you learn the material.", "Dr. Martin is the best yet hardest professor I ever took in my years at SAC. I took him for two courses in the mid 1970's. He is a great lecturer and a fair test giver. His exam essay questions are difficult,yes, but not unfairly so. If you love history; if you can read comprehensively and analytically; and if you can write well, take Dr. Martin.", "This class was SO HARD. Be prepared to teach yourself and spend a lot of time doing it. He's so quiet and class and literally goes over no examples in class.

He is hilarious and lectures will keep you entertained. I spent almost every day in the physics tutor lab and it paid off. Lectures are only mandatory for attendance (iClicker points).", "Definitely knows his stuff but has seriously high expectations for students. I like history (LSM Am. Studies) and worked really hard (went to office hours, did the readings) and simply couldn't get an A on anything. He was not helpful when I asked him how to improve on future assignments.

Bring your book. You'll just go over the chapters. Homework is pretty easy. Lots of in class discussions. I LOVE his class. You will too.", "Awesome teacher. If you want a class that is going to push you to be a better writer, take Tim. One of the most friendliest, down to earth teachers I've ever had. He's big on questioning things, civil disobedience, and service learning. Never be afraid of him, he will give you all the time you need if you come to him during his freetime", "What a ass. If you can, avoid this guy. He's only interested in himself and doesn't give a crap about the student. Tenure is a horrible thing.", "I was a tad bit disappointed in this course. He is all over the place with his work which gets a bit tedious. Though he is a nice guy and an easy marker I can't help but think that it is not his class to teach.", "Extremely helpful and available. Highly intelligent, you will learn alot from any of his classes if you will let yourself!", "This prof cares more about hearing himself talk than your education. My peers busted their butts for B's, and the B is with a curve. On exams, show him exactly the way he shows you. If not, you are wrong. The biggest barrier to your success will be giving Tompkins what he wants the way he wants it. It's not learning the material.", "took this for my theme class, tons of writing and reading but hey its english. Cultural events were actually very interesting and enjoyable I did a few extras of those... class time is just book discussion and I hope the soccer book is never used again and most people in the class feel the same way (he was very upset when he found this out)", "He is a really cool guy and will help you out if you need anything. He has five exams but if you miss any you can take the exam on a make up day for any reason. In class its good to go but not mandatory, he gives really good examples. Mainly read the book for the exams and you will do fine!", "Very Enthusiastic teacher. He will tell you exactly what he will be covering in each class in the syllabus. ALL test questions come straight from the online text book. Put bolds the important words. You don't ever need to go to the lectures if you read the text book. I never did, but got an A. The text book is also an audio book.", "More than a little self impressed. Asks obscure questions.", "He is a really cool guy. Politics is his profession (he's the mayor of menifee) so he knows what he is talking about. the class consists of only 3 tests, which is intimidating, but if you follow the study guide, it's an easy A. i didn't read my textbook, but needed it to look up terms on the study guide. Great, hilarious man.", "Best teacher I've had so far. He's very funny, you just have to show up to class and do the essays he gives for homework. There aren't many, it's based on readings he put on e-reserve and it's just your opinion about it. You don't need a textbook for him. Super easy going and friendly. He has some pretty interesting life stories also.", "Teacher way heavy on the mid term and final exam. Both are strictly essay which was scary at first. But he is super fair and an easy learn just have to listen to a lot of lecture .", "he's a good guy, genuinely. no more quizzes, and really difficult exams. but he wants you to do well so if you see him he is an extraordinary resource. he will go out of his way to make sure you are doing well if you just show you care. you dont HAVE to read the book, but it does help a lot. he goes over everything imp't in class. id take him again", "LOVE the Doctor! Would take him for any class he teaches, just an all around neat guy!", "He's incredibly sweet. One of the best teachers at CSUN. He is very helpful and knowledgeable. Keeps the class fun and interesting. I enjoyed Calculus because of him! Take him for sure!!!!", "I was worried when I decided to take this teacher. This is not an easy class. The teacher is wonderful and takes time to explain the material. If you hope to pass without studying this is not the class for you. If you like to learn from somebody who knows, I recommend this teacher. He is absolutely one of the best. You have to work very hard.", "too many mushrooms", "Overbearingly rude and thinks it's cute. He is very harsh and views himself as merely \"demanding.\" The actual material and class is pathetically easy, but he tests over inane details and is rude to any students with questions. Even intelligent and well thought-out questions usually result in him announcing to the class that you have wasted his time", "Hes really funny when he gets going its just those stupid take home tests and in class tests that he gives us that suck! I mean he goes on and on about stuff that isnt even on the test!", "good teacher, kinda boring at times, but nice guy", "This professor was useless, absolutely useless, aced the midterm and final but got a B in class for being late, was justified, but not to him, nothing in the lecture involved any material relating to engineering till the final exam and only one question, thank god i graduated from DeVry (My high school is tougher than DeVry)", "This was a fantastic class. Paulo knows the material through and through and is willing to give you the help you need. I would take this class again in a second.", "not the most motivating guy in the world, but what can you expect in a class of 400?", "Bracken is probably the most difficult english professor I've ever taken. Basically, for an english major he is the barbed wire fence you might want to throw yourself at. His exams are based on a part A and a part B. With three of the initial readings and three of the latter readings. A tip for 309: Know both the conversion experience and the [x].", "The best professor I have ever taken. He is funny, knows his subject. If you want to get a nice grade, you have to take him if you get a chance. He is the best.", "He comes across pretty strong at first. Scary, even. I thought that he would eat me alive if i ever asked a question. Not true, he is incredibly helpful and respects you for trying and actually asking for help. Great guy, great teacher. He is too funny.", "Very hypocritical. Teaches a class that should teach open mindedness but yet he is the most close minded person I have met. In his class there are two types of OPINIONS, his and the wrong ones. I would say the class is 90% online yet he is incompetent at helping/working with Moodle (the class' website) himself. If you get him good luck.", "Great teacher! super easy and helps with any questions you have. We didn't have to buy a text book. He is very nice, and I would take him again for another class.", "He is in my opinion one of the better professors on this campus. He is also a pretty easy going and funny guy.", "His door is always open. He will like you if he knows that you are trying.", "The course work is demanding but rewarding. It's a weel taught class, but be sure you turn your cell phone off before you enter the classroom. I really liked this professor", "It felt like a high school class going through the motions, but I didn't really learn because it was so basic. Mostly practice problems that didn't count for a grade. Class was not stimulating, but rather boring.Also he thinks he's funny, which can get annoying. Don't buy the book because he requires online text. Take the class only if you have to.", "While I can't profess any real interest in Geology, I appreciated this instructor's passion. You will learn alot, despite your best efforts. The perfect model of what a good teacher can accomplish. He really sets the bar high for his coworkers.", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Overall this class is easy. Just need to practice for exams or you will not do well.", "Lectures are BORING and so hard to follow. But it is just all math, so its hard to blame him for that. Book is very helpful. I pulled an allnighter the nite before second test, just reading the book and got almost 100% without ever paying attentionin clas", "Lectures are boring and information is unclear. He is very unprofessional and treats you like an idiot if you are not understanding the info. He plays favorites and ignores the students who have difficulty in class.", "I believe that he may be a great architect but as a teacher, it needs a lot of work, because I had trouble in that class.", "He's the man. Really interesting lectures and reading. Got me interested in studying religion.", "You should choose to take Professor Bracken's courses because he's one of the few critical minds at the University of Alberta who actually takes a bite out of reality. The only issue is that Professor Bracken is so good at what he does that not only does he make other professors seem unqualified but he also reveals your own skill level.", "Excellent man.", "Has no respect for anyone. He's not a teacher, but a clocker. Should do something else in his career, awful professor. Exams are MC and tricky. Gives no partial credit. STAY AWAY!!", "he goes way to fast in the class, \"hands on\" isn't really hands on at all, you don't get to do****, he reads straight from the book. i loved biology till he ruined it for me.", "Very intelligent and knowledgable about his topic, but somewhat confusing. COuld have been the content of the course.", "Daniel is a great sculpture prof, i dont know where you all get the idea that he isn't, cuz he is. He is so helpful and always has a lot to say and always takes you seriously. Definitly one of my favorite profs.", "No Comments", "He is a great teacher, when he teaches! Which is not very often. He knows the subject very well and is passionate about it . However he hardly lectures. The first day of the semester he sticks you in groups and you better hope you get a good group because you will be each others teachers for the semester.", "No textbooks, no midterms, no quizzes, no finals. 3 papers (2 responses and 1 final paper). Your presentation is based on your final paper. Attendance is mandatory (usually sign-in sheet). If you do not write the way he wants you to write, expect a highest of a B-. Hard to understand him but his style of teaching is recommended. Just participate!", "AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING Definately one of the best teachers I have ever had. Great guy!", "Very nice guy..very good teacher. He is enthusiastic. He is not in it to \"trick\" you. Very helpful, and knowledgable.", "Damn good teacher. Practices what he preaches. Whoever says he doesn't teach probably doesn't listen in class and likes to slack off. DUDE THATS ME and i still learnt so much. He made me want to learn. There's a lot of assignments but they're easy. Whoever says it isn't clear it's because youre DUMB and dont listen. Take him. but dont slack.", "What a cool class. I had a few good laughs and learned some fun facts. He is way cool, exams are long, but nothing to stress over. There should be more professors like him.", "Study his examples and you won't go wrong with his tests very straightforward. The essays on the tests are not hard. Go to his office if you need him for help. Nice professor take him if you can.", "All I can say is Don't take this class. If you want to learn self defense go to a real school not some 8 week class where you are going to be abused physically and verbally. Oh and the teacher expects you to do his job and teach your peers. Not work with them but teach them. If you don't do that you get yelled at.", "Very good storyteller, chooses a wide variety of texts and is extremely animated, making for a good lecture. Sometimes a little low on class discussions.", "Steve is a very good teacher. He takes an interest in students and helps, encourages. I enjoyed his class because he treats you with fairness and respect.", "One of the smartest professors I ever saw. I really like that he tries to make sure he's not wasting our time. He wants questions but not the attentionseekers who just want to hear themselves talk. He can come across like a hardass to keep slackers in line but he tells you exactly what you need to study, he wants you to succeed. Very funny.Awesome!", "Prof. Psaromiligkos is perhaps the most clear and precise professor that I have ever taken a class with. He is also extremely dedicated, hardworking and is always willing to clarify any doubts that a student may have. His class notes are very well organized. He is also very friendly and has a nice sense of humor. Indeed, the best prof at McGill.", "Great teacher. He went off on tangents, but they were great stories, and he was a smart man. i'd definately recommend him", "Very good looking. Overall, a very very very very EASY grader. Curves like crazy. EASY C in his class. Average is a B+. Nothing to worry about. Went to office hours and blew me off though.", "Great guy, fun class, lots of practical information", "Really nice guy, really knowledgable. He did care about his students learning.", "Le prof est sympathique et aidant (hors-classe), mais son cours est assez disparate! En effet, essayer de suivre le fil de son discours est tr\u00c3\u00a8s difficile... Il ne suit pas vraiment le plan de cours et semble toujours avoir une anecdote hors-sujet \u00c3\u00a0 dire. Mais \u00c3\u00a0 la base, le cours est facile: Faite vos lectures et surtout les exos de la semaine!", "Although he is a tough grader, everything you need is provided. Either go off of his powerpoints for papers or go in for help. He is one of the most accommodating professors for those who go in to ask for help or with questions. I bombed a paper but was able to learn from it and got nothing but 85% or higher for the rest of the semester.", "Good professor for this introductory class. The lectures reinforce exactly what's in the book so attendance isn't really mandatory, but he ends early almost every day. Work through the chapters to answer the weekly true false quizzes and you'll be fine.", "Took him for an online class & didn't learn anything relevant to the subject. Only thing I learned: how to make a Wiki page (which I'll never use again). He assigned 2-4 useless assignments A DAY (including WEEKENDS). Had to call his secretary several times for help because he would never return emails. BEYOND unorganized & not helpful at all.", "Uses pwer points, class is boring, but he tells funny stories, tests are tough only b/c there is a lot of info to memorize", "I've never had a teacher pass out so many papers. This is strange for a environmental guy. In average lecture, approximately 25% of what is said is repeated stories/ insights that you hear everyday,rest is confusing assignments. Not nice at all.", "He is a super nice guy and want the best for his class. That being said if you go to his Office hours he turns into a mean person and kinda judges you. But other than that he was awesome and would def recommend him.", "Professor Catalano is a cool dude. Really enjoyed his class, attendance is mandatory if you want to pass. Tests are rather tough but he offered huge extra credit at the end of the semester. Oh and you need to buy HIS textbook, about 90 bucks. I believe he said he curves final grades if needed; he really wants you to do well.", "Ian Kinder is a great professor! His teaching methods are accurate and helps you in the long run. This class will prepare you to defend yourself in various ways. You will have fun in this class for sure!", "He gives homework every night but doesn't check it, just goes over it in class and calls on people to answer. The tests aren't hard unless you don't pay attention or don't take any notes. He is a really nice guy but really likes his job so is very serious about the class.", "Dr. K is the best chem prof ever... he gives a ton of extra credit opportunities, very laid back, pretty cool over all. his class is much easier than any of the other classes, at least for Gen Chem. try to get his class.", "You never know what Kawchuck is going to pull out of his bag - an extremely entertaining, energetic, and dynamic, Prof. A class is never dull with Kawchuck.", "All about me me me me ... Terrible teacher. Needs to learn to teach. He seems to have met all the top CEO's in his impressive career, but forgets that we really do not care unless he can impart some knowledge.", "He's such a horrible, lackadaisical professor! Avoid at all costs; he'll ruin your GPA. I took him for grad level statistics. He didn't teach anything at all. All he did was talk about his children and personal life. He even admitted that he didn't know how to do some of the material he went over in class.", "I love the class! He is very helpful and sending emails for each reading keeps me on my toes with the assignments. Tests...if studied for are very easy!", "He was my teacher for years. He knows alot about deaf culture, history and linguistics. I loved having him and it was a lot of fun. It was very educational for me. If it werent for him, then I wouldn't be able to know a lot of things because I am currente", "He is one of the best", "taking a class with mark is like baiting a wild bear, i wouldnt recommend either. prone to fits of rage and disparaging comments. hard grader. just tells you what to paint..and skips the whole \"how its done\" part", "Okay so most people take this just for the credits, and thats all. He goes too hard", "Easy class we get out early and there is no homework except for studying for quizzes or exams. He has a short paper at the end. Lynn is very clear and easy to understand.", "Tried taking this class online, dropped after the first Exam that I Flunked. Never answered emails for help, told me to go to tutoring center for help, I took online since I am a working adult and couldn't take on-campus course. Never felt like could keep up with the online program and work. I am an A student, but was going to flunk if didn't drop", "Dennis is a great prof.

You feel a real sense of accomplishment when you do well in his classes!", "No Comments", "Tim is a really nice man and is very knowledgeable about his subject, but as a teacher, he is often inconsistent and frustrating. A lot of reading and busy work.", "Schneider is a poor educator but he does seem to know the material. He changed the weighting of assignments several times throughout the semester which was annoying. The class project was far too large in scope and felt more like slave labor since it took hundreds of hours to complete (yes, really).", "Good teacher. Didn't go on and on like some professors. Got the point pretty quickly.", "This professor's class. African American Lit was my favorite class of my university career. He challenged us to think about racially heavy topics. This is a very good thing for people to do. We ignore race far too often. The sentiment usually goes \"we all know racism is bad, so what else do we need to talk about.\" He also chose wonderful texts.", "This man is hilarious,wise,inspiring and tries to use example in everyday life. However,Proff Strong is very disorganized. We ended up using lab time for lecture time often and missed material not included in our books and when it came to exam time,a lot of material was indeed not covered. If you're lost,you'll be directed to THE search engine.", "He's an excellent teacher. You learn alot but have to earn everything. Recomend him if you truly want to learn about psychology.", "One of my favourite profs! He is such a great teacher and really makes this subject interesting. He seems to show a lot of passion for astronomy. He is quite helpful as well and it's very important that you attend his classes (10% was participation marks when I was in class). Overall, great prof.", "Boring guy!", "Follows the syllabus. You will have a quiz at the beginning of each class based on the current topic. All test and quizzes are open book. Test your knowledge on quizzes to see your proficiency on the topic through tricky questions.", "Proff Harvey is knowledgeable in this subject but has trouble relaying that information without reading his slides word by word. He does not post the slides until just before the exam. There are two exams. That's it and they are difficult. You really, really, really need to study. You cannot slide by in this class. Be prepared.", "Nice man, makes accommodations, tough marker", "Taking 312 with Ramin really kindled my interest in CS. He's a dynamic and lucid lecturer, with a flair for the material. His exams were engaging, the homework was interesting and manageable. I hear good things about machine vision, but can't comment from personal experience.", "Grad from class of 1983. Dr. Vona is by far the best professor I had at JJC. Very attentive to students who show a willingness and desire to learn. If you are willing to work and want to learn, take as many classes with Dr. Vona as possible.", "No Comments", "Your grade is divided into 3 tests and 1 final exam. All are based on the textbook, yet lectures are just simplified coverage of the textbook.

Very knowledgeable, but should be avoided for the sake of your GPA.", "This class is probably the easiest statistics class!! He's hard to understand but if you know how to study on your own you'll be fine. Just study the homework for the tests.", "good teacher, nice guy, and fairly interesting", "No Comments", "I loved my honors seminar class with him-- the material we read was very interesting. We had to read a lot and were writing papers every week. It's a lot of work, but the knowledge you gain is incredible. Really makes you think. Of course, sometimes he'll tell you a bit TMI, but he really tries to connect with his class. You read long novels.", "HE'S NOT VERY INTERESTING. vERY MUCH A NERD, WHO REALLY RUINED A FUN CLASS AND MADE ME LOSE INTEREST. hE LIKES TO RAMBLE ABOUT NONSENSE AND HIS tA'S ARE HALF RETARDED, ALTHOUGH HOT. i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GUY. nOT QUALIFIED!!", "kwag, kwag, kwag...wow. In my 22 year career as a student I have had perhaps one other teacher this bad, this boring, this hard to follow. It is simple. he should not be teaching period.", "Ok, he hardly shows up for class. All he does it babble on about politics and hardly mentions anything that we're actually supposed to be talking about. One day he just let everyone out about himself (awkward). I think he enjoyed the 70's WAY too much. Easiest \"A\" anyone will ever get.", "Class is a lot of work that really has nothing to do with philosophy. Work itself is pretty easy. I managed to get an A. You just have to do the work. You will get frustrated easily though. You will have to buy like 5 books and use them all a lot, and keep a journal. One personal presentation and a couple of group presentations.", "I find this class to be a breeze. If you actually do the things he tells you to its an easy A or B. The multiple choice questions are literally word for word from practice tests and his papers are very short and clear cut. You follow the criteria and you get 100 like I managed to do. The lectures aren't very interesting though.", "I took this professor for a Summer Spanish 101 class. My experience was terrible. He tries to weed out the students that don't already know Spanish. If you get a question wrong he will insult you. If you ask a question he will insult you. If you forget an accent mark. The whole question is wrong.", "Great prof! His assignments were easy, yet meaningful. A great beginning to my Education degree! He is easy to talk to, understanding, loves to give out candy, and makes class enjoyable! Great job Kowalka!", "Not helpful at all. He left on two trips during the semester and did not care at all. Study edge and his class notes barely helped either.", "Knows his stuff but worst prof I've every had. A complete nutter. Goes off topic all the time about subjects outside of the course, and makes wide sweeping comments. Rants every class about how wrong Western society is and what a utopia China was. Some comments border on insulting. Thinks the CIA is out to destroy China. Avoid if at all possible.", "Very nice professor. Answers emails promptly. However, doesnt have chat hours which is really hard to deal with especially for a math course. Otherwise everything is with webassign.

Nice guy though.", "Madden is a funny guy and I found his class somewhat interesting/entertaining. The tests were moderate and the only other assignments were to read 3 novels throughout the semester and do a book analysis on each which weren't hard. My TA was good too. Attendance not required.", "Brilliant. And open to non-traditional approaches (fiction, plays, whatever) to the third year paper.", "He is a very immature guy. He believes he is always right even when he is not. I've had to schedule with him, but believes it is my fault even though I gave him at least two weeks notice. He treats students as kids and not as adults.", "Thank goodness for his TA who didn't mark the papers very hard. Dr.Hynes knows a lot, but he didn't teach clearly. The lectures weren't structured, impossible to take notes. Not the hardest prof on planet earth, but nothing special.", "a lot of work for an online class", "Strange and Interesting man, questionable teacher. He will beat one aspect of a book to death unless the students comment during class. Tests aren't bad as long as you regurgitate what he tells you. Class is far more interesting when people participate and he isn't left to ramble for ages.", "Easy A. Class can be confusing. Just follow all the required materials. Goodluck!", "Dr Terry is a horrible professor and doesn't like to make sure you understand.", "He is by far the best teacher that I have had at SIUE. He is extremely helpful and very talented. I didn't know he was retired? I guess he came back to teach my class, but I'm so glad he did!

He answers questions clearly when asked. It is about as interesting as chemistry can be made. The course is a lot of work, reading and problems. There is a lot of personal responsibility here. There are plenty of oppurtunites for a good grade just doing the work.", "This person is masterful at implying content to what he says and does. I prefer substance. Seems to have a predilection towards the avant garde, and is dismissive of many types of work he feels has been sufficiently represented historically, although his personal work looks like lo-grade 1950's Ab-Ex. Go figure.", "very approachable very funny! be prepared for a lot of discussions", "Excellent teacher. Very fun.", "Mr. Stewart is so awesome! He's one of the best professors I've ever taken. He cares, he helps, and he's very interested in his students well-being. He's also fun on TIPA trips!!", "He doesnt teach the material and actually fell asleep during a student's presentation. Just like in grade school, he does not allow you to get up to go to the bathroom during class and wont let you tape record him....it wont take you long to figure out", "Too much to say in too little time, almost half of what is said is over my head.

Had him for a couple of classes. Really good teacher.", "If you can appreciate genius in action, take a class with this professor. He is tough, but with good reason. Pay attention and you might learn something. Besides, that smile of his makes it easy to forgive him for being a hard grader!", "If you ask a question in class there is a big chance he will condescend to you in front of everyone, and you will never ask another question again. You go through the homework and feel like you will do well just to bomb tests. Part of why the tests are so awful is because he doesn't provide any formulas or constants unlike every other professor.", "It was really boring. I did EVERYTHING I could think of to stay awake in that class and never could. The quizzes were horribly misleading because of the way they were phrased and he seemed to prefer the papers I wrote the night before they were due to the ones that I worked on ahead of time. But he was always willing to help during office hours.", "Great prof. Very hard, but definitly makes the material seem more interesting", "Good guy. Tests are easy, just study the powerpoint notes and you will do fine. Not as bad as these other reviews make him seem. Class is boring but, he does not care if you use the computer the whole class.", "Dr. Terry = love/hate. If you pay attention and show up (though he doesn't count attendance) you'll learn a lot. Where he lacks, however, is the tests. Often Dr. Terry's tests are insanely hard and he grades very strictly. Causal arty's could audit.", "Grades on a 10 point grading scale. He is so nice and always energetic and ready to teach! I would recommend him to anyone!", "Seems intimidating at first, but just jokes around a lot. He tries his best to make boring topics interesting so you don't fall asleep. Read ahead before class because he likes giving pop quizzes, and a lot of the time the same questions come back on exams.", "Interesting, engaging lectures. He's a cool guy that always has interesting stories to help you understand. A lot of papers and a couple tests, and a ton of reading, but the whole class is fairly laid-back and interesting so it doesn't feel like a big workload.", "Avdulov-Sensei will change your life. His classes are rigorous, although not necessarily difficult to do well in. Dedication and attendance are mandatory, however if you put forth the effort he will make sure you get an A in his course. He is both professional, and enthusiastic, and integrates both Japanese culture and language into his lessons.", "Prof DEFINITELY knows his Greek, but seemed bored while teaching it at this introductory level... like he always would prefer to be elsewhere. Very gracious in allowing retests, but could benefit from a bit more time spent upfront in assuring students are onboard.", "There is something kind of tough about his physical appearance. My friend once said, \"that guy eats glass for breakfast.\" I don't think it's true, but at least it's funny. I liked his intro to Greek class. He's unbelievably patient with beginners!", "he's one of the best professors at BC. Dr. K is very knowledgeable in the subject of Neuroscience. The lectures are kind of stale, but he has the best stories to tell which helps the material stick. He's also hilarious! Yes, his exams are difficult so you must keep up on your studying. Take him if you can!", "You can hardly understand him through his thick accent. He also taught Calculus but it was not beneficial to us engineers as he taught Business Calc. Bad Teacher! Avoid Him. Tests are easy, but I didn't learn anything and I got an A+!", "Excellent professor. Tells u exactly what will come up on the mid-term and final. Assignments are straight forward. The course is not that hard and he makes it even easier. Getting an A is not so hard provided you do weekly practice of the questions. Good luck", "The professor is very friendly and loves to give to give students life lessons. The class can be boring at times boring because he loves to bounce around topics (anatomy to life). As for the exams, quizzes, and labs, they are very easy. Best advice, memorize everything and beware of falling behind in anatomy... otherwise it will bite you in da ass!", "No Comments", "Awful. Does not know how to lecture nor teach anyone anything. I studied and also had a tutor, I'll be lucky to get a high B. He teaches all application, so you have basically no idea when taking the test.

Wtf.", "this guy is horrible. his lectures are pointless, he doesnt know how to use a computer so good luck getting your grade. He doesnt answer questions in class.

He never really answered any questions I had, just do the online assignments on time, if people stop showing up he starts giving random quizes to take attenance.

He's a very nice person, but he tends to ramble and lecture about things that aren't on the test. Then the tests are about things that you've never even heard of.

However, his art knowledge is primarily based in the late 70's/80's and says all art is cyclical and therefor has no need to go to see any new art because he has already seen something like it 20 years ago.

I know lots of students who had to come back for another year because he told them the wrong stuff. Good at teaching A & P, though!", "Alright prof. Classes were rather monotonous since he's a slide reader. All important info is on the slides. Make sure you copy the slides in class as much as possible, since some info is missing or different on the slides he provides online.

Give yourself enough time to finish all the assignments. Score high on those as well as the tests. I had some interaction with the professor, but really this is a class that you can do on your own.

Felt stupid in this class! Felt stupid because of the teacher!!", "Not only is Craig one of the most experienced and passionate professors I've taken a course from, but he is just a really, really nice guy.

Too much reading, and even the reading materials are boring. He even changed the exam format a week before the Final.", "These is without a doubt one of the worst classes i have. he tells us to read the book for the quizzes then never puts that info on the quizzes.

There's 5 modules and you get 3 weeks for each one. There's a few assignments, a blog post, and a quiz each module. Totally doable amount of work. Only thing is, for the blog you need to work with your group and a lot of people wait until the last minute. Cooke was very helpful and informative either way. Highly recommended!", "He is such a monotone speaker. I felt like sleeping ever day in his class. But his assignments and grading schemes are amazing.

Nice guy though.", "He assumes a position of intelligence, but lacks the acting skills to see it through...tragically, he is not aware of this.", "Take note of EVERY WORD that comes out of his mouth. He WOULD test you on it. Also read the text because he would test you on that also. In all it's about 120 multiple choice questions in 2 hrs. He gives credit for good attendance also.

Sometimes, anyway.", "he forgets the concept of Gen Eds. he's harder than he has to be considering half the students in the class are forced to be their by the curriculum. why powerpoints exams? everyone has their own speed and the right to look back at the questions. who's he to eliminate these options? and why are the questions worded like the lsat?", "Took SPE at my home place. Almost passed but no luck. Had to repeat it at Harper thought the course would be a joke. Wow I was wrong! Professor B is the dude to take. Prof B is dope.

You work a lot in groups which is pointless for that class. He is unorganized, unclear, and boring.", "My favourite prof. Makes lectures interesting. Always there for his students, helpful, & approachable. Wants you to learn & grow. Presents contrasting arguments to really make you think. No textbook. Content can be challenging so you have to make effort. I like that he encourages class discussion but sometimes he lets people drone on for too long.", "He just reads from his slides, quotes a lot from famous people. But always stutters during his talks and contradicts himself.", "Taught in a big lecture hall and he talks kinda fast so you cant really zone out, but no homework and he did lots of practice problems to make things simple. Really animated.", "My only advise is to do the example problems and tests. He takes the test questions directly from them.", "brilliant prof, always explained everything SO well, entertaining, interactive, thoughtfully answered questions, reading wasnt't too brutal, midterm was fairly easy, great class", "Great course! He made class enjoyable! very laid back and easygoing!", "My experience with Immaculata has been unrewarding. First the mistreatment that I had with the Asst. Dean in Lifelong Lwarning. (Rude is an understatement). Then this teacher is insensitive and impatient. Give me a reak university. VU here I come.", "this guy was horrible...point blank...i would ask him a question..he would answer a different question..WACK!!!!!!!", "I consider myself a speaker with professional training through the military as a briefer and I received a very high B. Other students that I felt were weak received B's and A's. He seems to grade you off of your individual potential instead of grading you off of the other students. This will benefit a weak speaker and hurt a charismatic person.", "I've always been bad at math and after failing college algebra the first time I never thought I'd be able to pass this class. Bob Young cares about students and offers extra credit, amazing study tools online and in person, and other helpful tips throughout. Without his hilarious and effective teaching methods I wouldn't of passed this class.", "he's very....colorful...rainbow colorful. He's got 6 rings on at all times, three on his left and three on his right. an earing. and he runs around like a chicken with its head cut off...but god is it a great class.", "This professor was a great one. I looked forward to attending this class every week. He really knows what he's talking about and is a great teacher. There is a good amount of work and it is mostly online but if you keep up with the workthen you'll do fine. Highly Recommeded", "Worst teacher in the entire planet. You will not learn anything about self defense. He will keep pushing his business on students and will gladly fail you for no reason at all. This teacher will be more than happy to kill your GPA. If you come late once , he will close the door on you then it is an automatic C. Worst Worst teacher ever.", "He is the def the coolest and chillest teacher in the world! He has many research opportunities and he really believes you learn by doing instead of just reading and studying! It was a very fun class and we got out early almost every time.", "Wonderful teacher. You will learn so much about life and yourself in his courses.", "He lectured on alot of history around the 50's. He never covered much material after that although we still had to take quizzes on it. A nice person but became mundane after a while.", "Bender is awesome if you love to argue. He definitely makes you work for your grade, but it's worth it, and A's are possible. He's a great prof and more than willing to help you out.", "If you have a hard time with math DO NOT take this class. He doesn't help clear up questions and will just move on to the next section. He doesn't explain what he is doing, he just works a problem on the board in small writing and then moves on. He's always late. Even on test days.", "While I do find that college life explicitly involves freedom of expression, I do not think Professor Hancock's encouragement of vulgarity among students outside of class is appropriate or professional. I'm glad I transferred to Penn State", "He's a great teacher. His assignments build on each other, so make sure you understand as you go- and start the assignments the day they're assigned! My first C was in his class, and I changed my major to business. But he's good for Computer Science majors, if you don't want an easy course.", "No Comments", "He is kinda boring, but if you do the study guide that is half the test. He is really nice and will help you if you go to his office. He always want people to come see him and makes himself very available. GOOD GUY!!!", "Awesome! Easiest A. He actually teaches and makes things clear but he is so helpful too. He will tell you if your HW is right before you turn it in so you can fix any errors. Plus you get five bonus points just for coming to class.", "\"PROFESSARIO\" IS AN EXCELLENT,HIGHLY EDUCATED MAN. YOU CAN BUY THE TEXT BOOK USED ONLINE LATE EDITION BUT THE BOOK ISNT NECESSARY AS HE IS A WALKING HISTORY TIME BOOK AND INFO IS GIVING BOTH ACCURATELY AND FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE.HE GIVES A REVIEW BEFORE THE TWO EXAMS AND WITH A RECORDER ITS A NO BRAINER. THE PRESENTATION IS EASY YOU PICK THE TOPIC.", "Dr. Ryan is a definete overachiever. Out of all the FYRST classes, ours did the most work! The assignments were a little dumb, and very time consuming.", "Class is not easy by any means. Multiple papers and group projects. Not to mention that Foreman is a pretty harsh grader. However, there is so much extra credit that it's impossible not to pass. Didn't do good on a few assignments and still pulled off an A", "Brilliant and Sexy; a combination that usually is orthogonal.", "Napoleon Complex Jerk. Should not be allowed to keep teaching. Most unfair grades in history. Prof. with this many psych. probs should have been retired long ago.", "worst teacher ever", "I had Dr. Cherry for American Short Story. Unfortunately he doesn't teach much since he's head of the dept. VERY unfortunate. He's an excellent teacher and I would love to take another of his classes.", "felt like corrections was totally unimportant after taking his class.", "Class is fun and centered around discussion. There is a lot of reading but you'll want to do it for the discussions. Other than participation, the rest of the grade is papers. If you like to write and discuss philosophy, this is a great class.", "Great professor, take his course without any consideration. Do something at home and you ll be fine.", "Best PS instructor I had at Riddle.", "He will tell you what's on the test, but you need to know the answers in painful detail. Don't underestimate this class because everyone told you he's easy.", "Rose is amazing & HELPFUL! He really made me regain interest & drive in my intended profession as a RN. One of those teachers you will remember/recommend always. Class was tough but he makes the information fun. He loves to ramble off about random facts/stories but he is entertaining and opens your eyes to a whole new world in the healthcare field.", "Dr. Koury used to be my advisor. Then he was promoted and never told me he was no longer my advisor. I went a whole semester with no advisor and never even knew it because he never returned calls or emails and never had time to meet me. When I did speak to him, he was rude and lazy and knew nothing about anything. He is a waste of space. Avoid him.", "The course itself is really hard, but if anyone was to teach it right it's him. It's clear he's taught this course for a while because he is so good at explaining concepts that are really tough. It takes time to understand but he makes it a lot easier, and cares about his students. Get the textbook, its worth it!", "Professor Rose was the only professor my first semester who really challenged me. His lectures are consistently engaging but he expects a lot from each of his students. If you think you can meet some high expectations, take his class. He's extremely helpful, very clear in what he wants, and very passionate and knowledgeable about what he's teaching", "Dr. Nelson is a great teacher. His class was interesting. Make sure you go to take notes because the tests comes directly from the notes. He put parts of old exams in the library on reserve, make sure you get those bc the exact questions will be on the test. If you study you should do well.", "Worst professor I could have ever imagined having. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.", "The lectures were hard to follow but he is a great guy and knows his stuff. Don' have to worry about getting the paper in on the due date, just get it in. He understands the meaning of GRACE. Thank you Jon!", "He has a wonderful way of presenting himself and I think that he fulfills his duties as a professor. He does an amazing job keeping the class interested (at least with my class) and I didn't mind the view from front row : )", "Advanced Contracts - Could have been good but Pratt mishandled the class organization and it was all over the place. i.e. reading requriements sent at 8 hours before class, unclear expectations, class was a philosophical cf, was not impressed.", "Paul was the voice that I needed when I was just coming into my own as an artist and photographer. He made me concentrate on mediums outside of my comfort zone and was critical but encouraging. I wouldn't' be where I am without him.", "Didn't he discover how the pyramids were built or something?", "One of the best classes I ever had at FIU, even though t was Saturday mornings. Very cool professor and a very cool class.", "This class was suppose to be so easy and it turned out to be a C for me. Thermo with Griggs was easier than this guy. He sucks.", "Easy class. Nice professor. I feel bad for him because everyone takes advantage and talked during his class, and those are the ones who fail, so that's their fault. He has office hours and can talk to you after class if you have trouble. I learned a lot - good class. :)", "I cannot understand how anyone can say that Dr. Kent does not offer feedback. He is always available after class and during office hours. He will answer any questions you have but you have to ask. Don't expect him to know that you don't get something. ASK HIM. Tests are intense but he practically gives you the test in his reviews! STUDY THEM!", "This guy makes it hard to wake up at 8:00am. His monotone voice and relatively boring approach to teaching cause me to fall back to sleep almost every class. If you can, take applied anatomy with another teacher.", "there is no excuses for not doing well, his tests were straight off the notes, and their wasnt even that many notes to learn in the first place. Anyone who said it was hard or that he was bad simply did not try", "Nice guy, if you have questions just ask. He is someone you really want to put in your network...for the future. So behave in class.", "Alan is a master of interesting/informative digressions and oozes passion for the art world. He has a bias towards the extreme avant-garde, so traditional artists may find the class a bit disheartening at first but the inspiration he imparts will drive you to push yourself in directions you wouldn't expect. A very knowledgeable, fun prof.", "No Comments", "No Comments", "David Tindall is a very nice prof and tries to help but I feel that this course - 2451 - is way beneath what he knows", "I did not get the grade i wanted and he is difficult. But he knows what he is talking about. Very smart man. To get an A in the class you HAVE to keep up with readings. Does give study guides though which are some what helpful", "This guy rules! Never took attendance but class was so interesting, always wanted to go. Whatever he is teaching, TAKE IT! Exams are take home, one small paper. Teaches from experience, and great stories.", "No Comments", "Best teacher ever! I have had him all four years and he has taught me a lot, I have a great deal of respect for this man! And I hope people will have the same experience I have had :)", "Heb is one of the best at AU! He not only is a professor but is also a business man. He knows his information! You can learn a lot from Heb!", "Milner is not clear at all. I would not recommend taking an education calss with him. He knows what he is teaching, but always changes dates, and does not tell you what you need to do/study for the class.", "Very smart guy..has a truly impressive grasp on the language for a non-native speaker. Very difficult though, and kind of mean. He can be rude and expects too much in my opinion. If you have to take Russian with him, you will certainly learn a lot, but I recommend choosing someone else if possible.", "Simply amazing. If you do poorly in his course, you have nobody to blame but yourself. He teaches the material very well, sticking to the textbook, with full answers online. Also, the exam questions were often variations of ones we had already seen/worked through together in class.", "He never gave us study guides, and there is no textbook. The tests are not really on what he teaches. He tells us silly random stories that have no historical significance (they're still fun facts, but knowing them won't get you a good grade). He's really funny and nice, and if you don't miss a class he lets you skip on the exam ;)", "Class wasn't that boring. Study the powerpoint slides and show up to class and you'll do fine. Group project was easy.", "Great, solid professor. People complain about the Electronic Journals, but c'mon, all he is asking you to do is write a response to a specific question he asks about the reading in 5-7 sentences. There are only 10 Electronic Journals, and two 3-4 page papers in this class, so its a breeze. Dr. Cherry is super knowledge and has tons of experience.", "Prof. Wernli is an awesome professor. If you are looking for an 'easy' A, you won't find it in A&P. He's a fair professor but you still have to earn your grade. Attend class, Study the notes he gives, read the book and you'll have no problem earning that A. Plus he's very helpful and willing to answer your questions.", "Amazing lecturer; one of the best at Brock for sure. Enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and injects a lot of humour into his lectures. Fairness is another question. I'm not saying it's impossible to get a good mark in his class; but I will say that you'll be disappointed. Not the most helpful outside of class, and class averages are abysmal. Audit!", "hes a really nice guy and lets you redo papers and really wants his students to do well. Gives you all the information you need to do your assignments. Your grade is basically on a couple papers. His lectures are pretty boring though but you dont need to go to them.", "Amazing teacher that obviously loves what he does.", "No Comments", "Nice guy, very cool. obsessed with SHMUPS. the work is easy, the assignments aren't too bad. You can study for the tests for 1 or 2 hours and get an A. Making the video game is awesome, and the top 4 video game creation groups get prizes (Like an X-Box 360 for example). If you ever wanted to make a video game, take his class, especially w/ friends.", "Very rude. If he doesnt like you you're better off not asking anything. Good luck with this stand up guy lol", "No Comments", "Professor Damen is a really kind and energetic professor, however his grading criteria is so hard to understand. He doesn't use canvas and your grade is basically unknown to you until a few weeks before the semester. Tests are all fill in the blank but good luck because they're hard. Lots of papers with VERY specific formatting and writing style.", "Held amazing lectures, and let you know exactly what you need to do to pass the course, though he is a tough marker. The lecture material definitely had the potential to be boring, but Allard made everything interesting and fun!", "Professor Bell takes the class very seriously. Many people get upset with him because they take it for an easy A and it is certainly not one. That being said, he is extremely knowledgeable and you can learn a lot in the class. Just put in the effort and you will do well.", "Arlan is an all around good guy and if you put in a bit of time and effort, he will reward you well for it. great class.", "No Comments", "Course integrates many science areas. Clear book, can handle the tests because each covers only 5 chapters. Like the prof, graded fairly, provided extra credit, knew our names, and emphasized concepts over memorization.", "Excellent, best professor ever!! He is the greatest!!", "great teacher. you will learn more in his class in one semester. than any other history class available. i highly advise to take his class", "Absolutely in love with his job and studies. Very enthusiastic about the subject matter, and lots of opportunities to get hands on. Beware of skipping out on lab or classes though - tests often cover material that is not in the textbook. Does give tons of easy/free points in the way of in-class activities.", "What's the point of paying a guy to tell us what to read in the book and then ask us what was in it? That's not education that's plagiate training.", "Mr. Bradshaw keeps things interesting, thats for sure! Could go into a little more detail in lectures, but he knows what he's talking about (possibly hundreds of years of experience), and is one funny man. A great guy and a good prof overall.", "His way of teaching forces the students to become an expert in the topic. Yes you are the one who gives the presentations, so you have to actually go and learn the stuff to be informative to others. Also, unless you are prepared to really learn do not take his class, and come back and whine about his class being hard.", "Awesome!", "John made class fun & interesting.He was an awesome teacher that will be missed by many. He touched the lives of all his students and had a big impact on all of us. Kish lost an icredible teacher this month.", "The test was a lot better than I expected. But not easy. Never went to class. Only read Gilberts supplement.", "Hannon is a nice guy, HW help sessions are a MUST attend if u want to do decently. Class is just HS physics using calculus, so u dont really learn much. Class is boring, just him proving eqtns on chalkboard. Labs are hell, wouldnt take class unless u really like physics. yuck", "Most insane teacher ever. Reminds me of John Malkovitch (complete with sleep-inducing voice). He came to class less than I did, but is still the sweetest prof ever. Your entire grade is basically given at the end, but he's lenient. Never again though.", "If you can't learn stats from this man, you should remove yourself from the gene pool. He's the nicest, most patient professor I've ever had. Explains everything and answers even the stupidest questions in a clear and humble manner.", "The BEST professor at Oakland EVER! He is very passionate about what he teaches and is very eager to help if you have questions or problems. He goes out of his way to make learning not only fun but rewarding as well. I can't say enough GREAT things about him! I would take more classes with him if I could! Oakland needs more professors like him!!", "cis 113 became Java instead of C++ this semester. He was somewhat new to it and made mistakes while teaching, but a lot of profs do. Even though, he tried his best and he was a good teacher. The best is his practice problems right before an exam, which he goes over thoroughly. If you know how to solve them, you should do very well on exams", "6 case analysis and final is a case. Workload is heavy after midterm. All the cases are after the midterm. You'll find it hard to get anything above 75.", "he is such an awesome guy and really loves phil. Only hw is readings from the text and 3 tests (all essay style). Easy grader yet hard material. Def challenges your mind to a whole other level. Lectures are interesting so make sure you attend. Doesnt really have lecture notes so you must do the reading.", "Dr. Wolf is hilarious! YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM (unless you are easily offended). He says anything and does anything! He makes you keep a journal but besides that haven't done any literature lol. We've read ONE story so far.", "Professor Paciocco brings a practical point of view to both criminal law and the law of evidence. Very good writer and teacher. You'll learn a lot.", "Impressive educational background overshadowed by his arrogant attitude. VERY full of himself. Pretentious and disorganized. No substance in his classes. He might have valuable experience but it's no good since he just can not teach. It has been a dissapontment to have him as a profressor. A V O I D", "My favorite professor. I recommend him without reservations.", "Very poor - its no wonder that our school graduates very few Chemical Engineers. Why? because he teaches the introductory ChE class!", "pretty bad, in a seminar class of 7 he lecture for two hours with no break. he literally doesnt stop speaking and its supposed to be a seminar. there is no exageration here. he seems to smart to beable to convey his ideas to undergrads. he is not very articulate and makes simple ideas unmanageable.", "I don't know why everyone else is complaining so much about this class. It is a very easy A. If you show up and do your homework you will pass. He is a very easy grader if you have basic writing skills (or just check your grammar with Grammarly). His class is incredibly boring though and there are daily quizzes (very easy though).", "He was easy, you don't have to do anything but show up, make sure to do all the online quizzes and thats about it", "he claimed it was an easy course, but ended grading very hard and ridiculously. grading sytem was horrible. also favored boys over girls. i do not recommend him!", "Gallaher is my favorite teacher I had my first year at Northwest. He makes class fun and entertaining with his many jokes.", "Dan is a really polarizing character. If you participate in class and ask intelligent questions he is very willing to help you succeed. His lecture style is really quite strange but I really enjoyed his classes.", "Wow, what a jerk. He treats you like an idiot online and is not helpful. He makes you feel like he is way to busy to bother with you.", "Extremely interesting class. Explains things well. Tests arent easy but he cuts a lot of slack int he grading. Your grade is just your tests, so if you dont do well on one tests, you'll get a bad grade on the course.", "James is a fantastic teacher. If you bomb the midterm or final it will not kill you. The inquizzitives he gives are impossible to fail and are an easy A. He is heavy on reading. The debates he gives are fantastic and another easy A. I would definitely take him again!", "he seems a little unfriendly during class, but when you speak to him after class, he's a great guy and very understanding, if you work hard and participate in class it is easy to do well, his tests are straightfoward and he gives you a review sheet, i wish all prof. were like him", "Dr. Fields does lecture a lot but he tells stories to go along with it to keep your interest. There are almost no assignments in this class, but the tests are pretty tough. Even though there are only 3 tests, including the final, they are pretty much your entire grade. The textbook isn't mandatory, but it will help.", "One of my favourite professors in 12 years of university! Grills you like crazy but it's to make you a better Nurse and ensure you provide excellent and knowledgible care to your patients. Excellent course. Great Prof. Will always remember the striking difference between ionized and unionized molecules!!!", "Easiest History of Arch I, II professor. Very willing to help.", "I took this course in a freshman only class and he was trying to help us out but wasn't very successful. I definitely recommend the course mainly because of the second half of the semester project. The first half is all earth science and he tends to stop himself and restart a lot- he's kind of all over the place. Nice guy though, willing to help", "Although he's a nice guy, Prof G is the worst professor I've had at Pitt. He teaches straight from the book, and you don't learn any application (which is basically what the tests are). Went to his office hours many times and didn't find it to be helpful at all. He knows what he's talking about, but he sucks at teaching.", "For intro level course he was impossible to listen to. I don't know if it was his odd mannerisms or slow, drawn out style but I found it impossible to pay attention in a subject I love. The material in class was less than half of what was on the test, reading the dry text was mandatory.", "WILL NOT DISAPPOINT. Amazing lectures, you won't be bored. Very helpful and funny prof as well, always there to talk or give advice. If you have the chance, take his courses. One of the best professors I've had the pleasure to know in my 4 years as an undergrad.", "Mike does not care about his students, the only way you will do good in this class is if you work your ass off or have previous coding experience. This class is VERY stressful and you have to put in like 6 hours a week just on homework if you don't understand. They do offer sl (student learning sessions) but they aren't all that helpful", "Let me start by saying this is not an easy class. You will have tons of homework to do each week. That being said I think almost all Algebra classes have the same work. Mr. G is a good guy and wants people to pass. If you do the homework and study his review you will be fine. May not get an A, but you will pass. I would recommend him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6", "A very smart guy. He knows well what he's teaching. Very open to questions. Clear notes.", "Not hard. What you are supposed to do for projects may seem difficult, but as long as you just cover exactly what it says in the directions, you'll get 100% on them. Tests are online, recommend reading the chapter only before test, do not need to otherwise. Super approachable and very understanding! Class can be boring, but worth going! TAKE HIM!", "This class is as easy as you want to make it. Do the simnet trainings and you will do fine on those tests. get the easy iclicker points. Hardest part is the lecture exams, but they are fine if you show up to class moderately. Funny guy. Satisfies a major business requirement as well.", "Heb is a great guy but not the best prof. You can learn from him but if econ is not your thing and you will need some better teaching you should try another prof", "No Comments", "Best class I have taken at JCU. Best class to prepare you for grad school. If you make this class a priority and put in the time, you will definately learn a lot. Exams are hard, because they really challenge you to think in a short amount of time.", "I took Contemporary Literature with him, and I'll say it was very thought-provoking. Honestly, never knew what topics we were going to cover in class, but the debates and subjects we went over were entertaining. Keep an open mind in his class,and don't be too sensitive to some of the things he brings up. Overall, very interesting class.", "LOVED LOVED LOVED Dr. Snider. Perhaps because I love Chem Lab, but Snider is amazing to take for Lab. He's hysterical and a great professor. He is there to help you at any time and has a great personality. Also doesn't make you do all the post lab work- AWESOME. I'd take him again in a heart beat!", "No Comments", "He's cool and easy, but beware he likes to bash students. He will say your business in front of everyone. Assignments are pretty easy. Make sure you do his online work and your fine. He grades on how much effort you put in. In class work is nothing. He will kick you out if you miss online work sooooo", "This prof is one of the best. His sense of humor helps u remember and learn the material. The workload is just right and his tests aren't difficult but not easy either. I would highly recommend him u will learn a lot!", "To the point: He is a good teacher if you dont like to study. His study guides are not the test. To find the anwers to the test will take you a few days. He is a good teacher for thouse people that learn by just hearing someone talk. Sorry dont recomend him, he also grades on a curve.", "Easy class and lab. The lab kit is ridiculously expensive. $60 for a box of basic stuff you can find at home - straw, clothespin, etc. Lab manual is $100, only difference is the lab sheets are different color. Easy A if you just need class for general education requirement.", "Definitely a good teacher.", "I knew very little about sound art before this class & this class was awesome. It's very hands on & the classes are jam packed with workshops, demos, visiting artists, performances, etc. Fun class!", "Had him for Spanish 303 and 401. He comes off as arrogant hecause he likes to boast about his education and his successful friends. Try to pay attention to the things he emphasizes, as they show up on the tests (at least, in 303). Although he is pretty arbitrary in his grading, he was sometimes flexible and willing to negotiate points on exams.", "He is excited about class and knows a lot about film. Though he gives quizzes on random days and never discusses the readings on which the quizzes are on. The tests cover material that he has not discussed and you must learn on your own. I would have never taken this class with him if it wasn't mandatory for my minor.", "I really love this teachers enthusiasm, but the subject still bores me. Be ready for his long useless talking about nothing, but try to enjoy his sense of humor if you can. Study please, i wish i could fix my grade.", "YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Impossible material, impossible assignments, impossible exams. I am a CIS major, and im telling anyone who is considering taking Irv...DONT DO IT! You will fail!", "He LOVES history. His passion makes you pay attention in class. I find that he assigns way to much reading. We use three textbooks on a regular basis and will read a chapter from each throughout the week. He expects you to do your work and all of your work so if you don't tests will be a challenge. Work is managable. Really helpful.", "This professor is AWESOME! he is such a pleasant down to earth Man. His class is a piece of cake, you got to do a 5 page paper, and midterm n final. we didnt use the book that much, because the subject explains all. he is not tough at all. I would recommend him for any class, ALL WE DID WAS LISTEN, HE IS TOO EASY!! N REAL FRIENDLY~", "Coach is awesome! He makes music so fun and the choir is incredible. He is such a good teacher and the concerts turn out to be just perfect!", "He's a nice guy who seems to know his stuff, however he doesnt teach it well at all. He's trying to make students teach themselves by forming groups and make powerpoint presentations for the class. However, this format doesnt work, you dont learn anything, and his tests are impossibly hard. Don't take him if you can avoid it.", "Dr. Bakker is as good of a chemistry teacher as it gets honestly. He uploads class lectures and does a great job explaining the math side of the class, which is normally where chemistry teachers struggle. Alot of people have dropped or have bad grades but this isnt an easy class but if you put in effort you will do fine. highly recommend", "His teaching methods are not normal. He would yell at you and tell you that you did it wrong, but on the other hand he would gladly help you correct your issues and understand what you were doing wrong. He would even come in on Saturdays to help his students learn and make sure projects were done on time. Great prof and helps with real world sits", "Took Chuck for my 101, 301, and a winter course to Finland. He is an awesome professor, grades fairly, and cancels class often. If you get the chance take the Crime and Justice in Scandinavia with him, you will love it.", "Mark gets pretty excited over Calc its funny. He does a really good job of staying upbeat and energetic even when my class was dead tired and I was nursing a hangover. The courseload is challenging but he helps you if you ask for it.", "Mr Cuevas is a decent professor. If you are looking to easily pass a literature class then take him because (assuming you read) you'll make an A with little effort. If you're an English major or someone interested in literature, then you'll be disappointed. Teaching aside, he's a really nice guy.", "Dr. James is filled with tons of excellent information. He provides resources to help guide you through the readings. Participation and doing assignment using the resources provided you are sure to do well.", "not interesting...went into tons of boring depth.. quizzes sucked and exams sucked worse. not a fair grading policy.", "Really friendly, good lecturer, and interesting.", "WASTE OF TIME and MONEY!! Make sure your heart rates are divisible by 6 or you'll get docked points! What a crock!", "Well spoken and very smart, but has a gigantic ego. Group conferences were just mini lectures. Written evaluation is based only on the second class paper.", "He has a take it easy, California style teaching ways. His programs are hard but do-able. You might have hard time hearing him in the class. Suggestion: Sit in the front seat. For exams, practise the exercises at the end of each chapter. His assignments are done in grp of 2 - choose a good partner.", "This teacher rocks!! Class is very easy no midterm,no final just answer 2 questions on blackboard every week answer come (straight out of the book) you have to be real lazy, and stupid to fail this class.Teacher answer all his emails is very helpful and friendly. Follow the his instructions and you can not fail. He is the BEST online teacher at jja", "Heywood is an amazing professor! He is one of very few whom I truly believe understands the \"real world\" and its workings. Willing to help you out with most anything - even if it has nothing to do directly with Geography. Very insightful, understanding and helpful. Would definately take courses from him again. EASY A in a 5 CREDIT course.", "Dr. Kelley is extremely clear if you would open your ears and pay attention. Yes, just like every class, you need to go over notes and study. His exams are on par with what he teaches. Unfortunately A+ isn't an option in this school, but an A is just as good here. He has a great personality and always willing to help if you need it.", "How did he become a Doctor? His classes were lower school level.", "Take advantage of extra credit opportunities and office hours. There is a lot of material, but the tests ask about broad trends and general connections, so just memorizing isn't that helpful. He is kind of a picky grader. Field trips are kind of random but fun, and he has a lot of jokes and interesting stories, so the class is laid back and fun", "A hard class, but he's a fair guy. Read your notes. Better yet, take notes instead of talking. Laziest class I've ever been in, and I'm a comm arts major!", "David is a good teacher. He knows how to make the subject sound interesting, no matter what it is. He also has really good stories to tell. If you have an opportunity to take a class with him, do it. You won't regret it. The only homework he assigns is reading 1-3 chapters a week and a weekly online discussion. The final was open book, open note.", "I took Elem.Algrebra twice and this is my second time taking Int.Algr.I wish had knew Mr.McDonald when I took Elem.Al. He is the bomb and explains everything where it makes sense. He also curves test grades everytime. Take him and you won't be sorry. HE'S THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Great instructor, let's you out early all the time.", "mcnorton tries hard to make a boring class fun. he doesnt always answer questions clearly and sometimes doesnt even give you an answer at all, but a very nice man", "English 65 / TechCom 65. Great professor. Very effictive teaching style. Easy easy class as long as you go everyday and do the inclass work and the few (easy) projects.", "No Comments", "Horrible teacher. Avoid at all costs. Puts things on tests that he NEVER goes over in class. Doesn't give much partial credit. Doesn't really seem to have a point when he's teaching. Overall just a crappy teacher.. don't take him unless you absolutely have to.", "He is a real peoples person, who has went to college himself. Great stand up guy, and straight forward person. great man. Easy A.", "Daniel is an amazing man and a brilliant teacher. He is the only UVic Visual Arts teacher who is not conceited. Anybody who dislikes him is bitter because he challenged them into understanding themselves. He is ALWAYS available for extra help and goes far out of his way to do so. You MUST take his class if you care at all about learning.", "Great teacher. VERY EASY tests and quizzes. Barely even studied. Lectures and notes are clear. Very straightfoward. Pretty funny guy too", "horrible man, i hate him so much!!!!!!!! don't take him, don't care about students", "took dr. c for psychopathology and he was incredible! he definitely isn't easy, but you learn a LOT and he is extremely helpful and insightful . he's also been my advisor and he's been awesome in that regard as well . i'd highly recommend taking him if you're willing to work hard & want to learn!", "Awesome teacher.", "So great. Jason is an amazing lecturer and makes himself available. Definitely is an inspiring teacher.", "I really enjoyed introduction to philosophy with Werner. He is very intelligent and has a lot of wisdom to share. I would recommend taking his class to everyone.", "Awesome. Very helpful, very approachable. If you try in class, and do the reading, you'll do fine.", "this was one of the most boring classes i've ever been to. i literally did not take one note except the class before each test. he would simply read throught the tests and go over the answers. if you don't mind the ridiculous banter and just want an easy A, this is the class for you. if you have difficulty attending boring classes, don't do it.", "Mentally the best prof. I have ever had. He pushed my mind to new creative levels. Love him! If you open your mind to him you can only gain.", "He is a VERY tough grader. He docks points for almost anything. All his tests are completely fill in and are very confusing. He is biased towards his book, being that he is the co-author & doesn't try to explain concepts in a different way even when students don't understand. He does not show interest or concern about his students. DO NOT TAKE HIM", "Prof. Stecker is really chill and he definitely takes time to explain anything relevant to the discussion that you don't understand.", "Dr. Sumner is a great teacher. I have an aversion and mental disability to math;however, intro to statistic was so easy with him. He jokes to make you feel more comfortable and he's always there if you need a help. Definitely recommended. Gotta love this guy!!!", "Great teacher. Not for the faint of heart, he can be abrasively constructive in his criticism. We wrote briefly every class. As long as you put forth effort he was willing to help. Pretty funny guy and his assignments are straight forward no bull. I'm sure he hates me for my Nuclear Fission paper but TOO BAD. I hope he sees I said that too.", "If you want an easy A than take him. Nothing has anything to do with the course that he goes over. All he does is throw temper tantrums about how Kean sucks and we watch movies ALL the time. Show up to class, do other homework, he does not care.", "Prof. Burns is honestly the best teacher you'll ever come across at STCC! He's amazing, and helps you out as much as he can. He understands the students and is very flexible. I recommend everyone takes him!", "I really enjoyed Tyson. I found him very entertaining. His tests were difficult, but it just made the A I made all the more rewarding. I enjoyed the challenge. He is always trying to improve his class, and asks students for feedback on every test. Lectures not very interesting, I learned most of the stuff from the book. Overall good class.", "Ok, the tests are very difficult, in-class essay format, but overall a good class to take. I learned alot about the middle east, but Dinero def knows his stuff, so you have to do the reading. He's very sarcastic, but his rants about the president are pretty funny. He'll keep you awake in an 8am that's for sure.", "Kurt seems like a real nice guy. Class can be boring...you have to prepare for the tests if you want a good grade...offers extra credit each week...does not take attendance so if you miss a class, no big deal. Overall, good/easy class.", "I love prof cebula - he's such a great guy - the absent minded professor! Extremely intelligent - has great stories - hard quizzes, exams are challenging, but he grades fairly - he challenges his students to think - if you're looking for an easy class, go elsewhere - whoever said he's boring can't possibly care about the world@@", "Took Rudi for Geography of Colorado. He's a really nice guy, but a little scattered in his lectures. He had required field trips, which I actually enjoyed. They may be prohibitive for some students as it required driving our own vehicles or carpooling far distances (NE Colorado and Vail valley.) Not my favorite professor, but informative enough.", "Very nice professor. Knows what he's talking about. Take home tests followed by in class quizzes which are based on the tests. Attendance is MANDATORY! Lectures were kinda boring though, they felt like it was the same thing over and over. Got a C in the class though due to not completing the Gordon Rule assignment but I would recommend him", "pretty easy as long as u have him. just write what he emphasizes in class and you are golden. dont ever try to write in ur own words, just write down (to highest degree) what he says in class and lecture notes.", "Professor Vyse is AWESOME. HE makes the material interesting at the 100 level course and incorporates a great sense of humor. He seems very reasonable in his grading, but mostly just a really intelligent, funny professor", "Dr Haynie is fantastic. One of the few teachers that is truly passionate about what he teaches. Very interesting & willing to help you with whatever he can.", "Excellent poet and critic. Enjoyed his East coast insights. Is married to a fabulous graphic artist and is proud of his family's accomplishments. He makes his classes relative to what is happening in the world at large. Very erudite and knows his stuff. Loved his class.", "No Comments", "this guy is tough, first of all everything he says seems to be about hungary. prof magyar, nobody cares, teach the course. and theology has no place in philosophy, they are two different animals. dont rec to anyone, avoid if possible/", "Taking Theater at the college level is like going to kindergarten with a PhD This professor makes no attempt to change this stigma. He is more concerned with showing how good he thinks he is than teaching the basics of good performance. This class does not prepare students for the vocal talent it takes to perform on stage.", "Class consists solely of student presentations - prof. does not teach material, provides only limited guidance of discussion. Expects a lot of prior knowledge of course material. Tests are very difficult. Papers graded with handwriting that is illegible so it is difficult to see what you did wrong and how to improve.", "He's awesome. One of the best prof's i've had thus far. Made one REALLY DRY COURSE...one of the most interesting i've taken. GO TO LECTURE AND YOU DON'T NEED TO READ!!!", "He has a sweet personality. Loves teaching statistics. The course is VERY HARD but he teaches everything with clarity. The Quizzes and hw's help boost the grade. Totally recommended!", "The material is interesting, the text is short and the prof is a hottie :)", "Beyond incompetent and basically phoned-in every class. Really could care less about the culture of design or the world we were getting into. Belongs more in an \"avant-garde art exploration\" class then one devoted to design and its history. Is openly antagonistic, rude and disinterested in his students.", "be sure to see him in his office hours if you want to do well, fortunately he seemed to have more office hours then the rest of my professors combined, papers take about 3 hours to write and about the same amount of time to edit", "took this course online i missed few posts, so got a lower grade - can be easy class if you do all the posts. no final no midterm, just the posts.", "Hes not that great of a teacher. He talks about a lot of irrelevant things. You learn more about him than you do about the actual subject. He does curve, but you don't learn. WHICH SUCKS! Hes nice, but his class and ethic are annoying. He doesn't teach well. His test and lecture doesn't correlate! JUST study and stick thru the class", "Okay.... His class is BEYOND hard. He has good intensions but is NO HELP. He feeds you such interesting things that will have NOTHING to do with anything on exams. You will HATE this class. My tip is, If you want to pass the class Read the chapters you need atleast 3 times and answer all of the review questions after the chapters. YOUR BEST BET.", "Lots of work!!! Teaches the class like its a math class not like a business class!! I personally was used to the style so thought it was great most of the class felt it was tough... Good Luck!!", "Best art instructor I've had so far.", "Like they say easy class, but what i liked most was the fact that he pushed us to be better people and actually apply what we learned into our life. Don't take if you want a challenge, but take if you want to be a better person.", "Although he uses analogies (that don't really make sense) to describe everything, he is still a very straighforward professor. Take notes on class lectures and study those for the quizes. The tests are exactly like the practice tests.", "I appreciate how clear Glen has made his grading criteria and class schedule. I just felt as tho his lecture exams had low balled questions on tiny details mentioned in lecture. Word exams are easy A's tho. Didn't enjoy this class, but you might.", "He was really bland and drawn out. I wouldn't suggest taking him unless you have to", "Attend class to take notes. Expect him to give favoritism to certain students by spending more time with them during in-class work. He will also talk about his own students to other faculty members in hopes that it will affect treatment of certain students by faculty. Expect tension between students when taking his course bc of this. Avoid him!", "All I can say is WHAT AN ASS!!This guy thinks that all his students should write like the writers for the 'New Yorker'. The average grade in our class was a B- and there was only two A's. The guy has the personality of a box and is probably the most unfair grader in this college. Unhelpful.You will learn more by staring at your belly-button lint.", "He is the head of ME department. He has been teaching thermo for years. His lectures can be dull and put you to sleep. He goes off topic a lot with his stories. Homework is not due till end of semester but keep up to do well on tests. The redeeming value is his tests are easy and curves very generously.", "great professor!", "Ernie thinks very highly of himself...can be a bit rude at times and i guess you could say he over teaches some material...very simple lab it doesn't take much to get it so i don't understand why he explained everything over and over...he also encourages people to ask questions, but tears them down and makes them look stupid when they do!", "Very Helpful and wants you to succeed! Bring your text book and a calculator. COME TO CLASS, DO NOT BE LATE! Study, study, study! You will pass his class and the compass if your LISTEN and do what he tells you to do... Dr. Hardy wants you to pass and he is there for you! Thanks to Mr. Hardy I am out of Math 98 and well on my way!!!", "He's too by the book and makes very rare exceptions. He's arrogant too sometimes.", "No Comments", "Really awesome teacher!! You can tell he REALLY loves what he teaches.. Class is pretty easy just do the journals..and you get to use study guides on the tests!", "No Comments", "He is very smart and knows what he is talking about! O-chem was something I knew nothing about, but I left loving it! His only downside is that he chooses favorites and is very arrogant. He was also very unorganized in handing back test/assmts/labs. If you can deal with that it is very worth your time to take his course.", "Class is relatively easy, the book helps but its not needed. As for the professor, he's a hit or miss. If you're late 10 minutes to class you'll only receive some credit for attendance. You're graded on 5 tests, online homework assignments and attendance. The tests are only 25 questions each but worth 100 points each. He can be very unprofessional.", "Mr. Young provides a relaxed classroom environment. He is a funny and bright teacher. He gives an extra credit opportunity before each test, most of which were just writing paragraphs about math site recommendations. He puts all his effort into helping his class succeed. Could not recommend him more!", "Great professor. It'll take you a couple weeks before you stop finding his voice funny.", "Not a bad professor by any means, but did not pique my interest in SE Asia. What angered me about him was that he seemed to really enjoy making students as uncomfortable as possible at times; especially when he knew that no one had actually done any research/readings. Would not recommend unless you have an inherent interest in SE Asia.", "This professor is no good at all. I felt like I wasted a lot of money on supplies not important for learning.", "His lectures are interesting for awhile, but sometimes you get the feeling that he just likes to hear himself talk. His tests are tough.", "Dr. Damen is amazingly helpful, and by far one of my favorite Professors. The content of the class was brutal, but he has a way of making it tolerable. He's incredibly motivating, and his comedy is stress relieving.", "He's really into musical films and gives very clear lectures but he can be rather repetitive and drag on subjects. Also, he is incredibly soft-spoken. Sometimes you can't hear him over the classroom's central heating. He uploads lecture slides and assigns readings. Study all that and you barely have to come in for class.", "Took his online course.If you plan on taking other classes and/or having a life DO NOT take this class. He is unclear, unhelpful and a bit nasty. When I emailed him to clarify things for me, he always came back with an email that was one line and made me feel like a complete idiot. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a disgruntled student \u00e2\u0080\u0093 his class was just that awful.", "a good guy", "He's smart but he's rude to his students. Very bad at explaining the concepts to students. Ask him for help? He'll act like you're wasting his time. If there's another option, take another teacher. You'll spend hours reading the textbook and watching youtube trying to teach yourself.", "Do you enjoy wasting 2 hours of your week learning about the opinions of a self-involved professor who is unaware of his student's needs? Then this is the class for you! I have never been so bored in a class. No participation, he just talked for 2 hours. Class more about classic authors than Freud orJung. Could not recommend this minicourse less.", "Worst class I have ever taken. He is condescending and not easy to work with. In the online class, he calls out your discussion points in red that do not align with his philosophy and makes you feel like dirt when asking for help. I wonder if he even likes doing his job.- pompous and grumpy. Stay away from this class if you can!", "great class", "This class was amazing! Its not your usual 4 or 5 page writing course. He makes things very engaging and different. We pretty much never used the book and the writing assignments were super easy. Also, we practically never stayed the whole class time.", "schreiber is AWFUL!!!! u never know whats going to be on his tests and he lectures about evolution and everything that is NOT on the test!!! its up to u to read all the chapters and figure out what the test will be. i DO NOT recommend him at all!!!!! STEER CLEAR!!!!", "A really nice guy but awful at lecturing! He could put you to sleep, his lectures were unorganized and didn't make sense, didn't help with the assignments/tests. Way to much reading, and dead boring texts. Not clear on what exams were based on, his notes never make sense. Fair marker, dead boring, but kind and lenient.", "I took his class becasue of the comments on this website. I couln't be more glad. Love his sense of humor. Very considerate of the working adults. Didn't get to talk to him personally but I could tell he's a great person who cares. Class: Challenging but great! would take him again in a heartbeat!!!", "Tries a bit too much to be humorous, but he can be pleasant. He does not allow you to leave the class and stares if you come in just a minute late. Tests could be a bit more clear. Do not challenge him to be wrong because he gets very irate- one student took a test but Sirkin lost it. Despite the room supporting him he still kicked the student out.", "Great professor!", "good professor, very helpful with students, grades fairly, tests hard but not if you study enough", "Brooks has been my favorite professor at FAU so far. I am a Biology major so this class is important to me but he made the class enjoyable even though the tests were rough. Just need to study well and you'll do fine.", "He is very helpful in class, but he will grade your labs very strict, & he will also leave rude comments on everything he grades", "Great teacher", "Great teacher. Dude knows a lot of stuff. Very technical course but he makes it interesting. Looking forward to later in the semester when we can be a bit more creative. He's very helpful. I was not getting a lot of the HTML stuff and he came in late on a Friday afternoon to spend an hour and a half to help and I finally got it. Not too many teache", "Honestly, my favorite professor at MDC. He's tough but he's also so sweet- don't let his biker exterior fool you.", "I took intro stats and although Velleman is known for \"taking the math out of stats\" the stuff you learn is really useful and applicable to the naturalsocial sciences. And he's super approachable. If you study, you'll do well. When he says he's taking the math out, he just means you don't have to do rote calculations; you THINK and logic it", "Great class, very clear lectures. Focused on helping us understand the concepts in depth. Homework policy is very fair (and TA was helpful). Every other professor at UCI that taught about P/NP-completeness left me confused and scared (Eppstein, I'm looking at you) but Arvo made it clear and intuitive.", "He's a nice and funny guy. But he is so unprepared and doesn't know how to use Sakai or a computer for that matter. Never responds to student emails. Never know when the exams or quizzes are going to be. He lectures about personal life 90% of time. Makes an easy A course hard to pass. Don't take.", "This professor is amazingly passionate about the courses he teaches. Thoroughly knowledgeable and cares about what the students think during lecture. Definitely take a course with him if you can!", "Cool class. I had lots of fun just talking about myself and talking about classmate's works. I liked the silent movie. I can't believe he's gonna be chaplain now!", "I enjoyed the class and teacher. As most History majors, there is addendai reading to be done. Great teacer and am glad I had him in class.", "He's is really passionate about his job, for an english class it was a piece of cake. I would recommend it to anyone. He is VERY easy going and cares. I felt bad not going to his classes. He doesn't assign much, but when he does make sure to do the work. He expects that and WILL call you out. GREAT CLASS.", "Took as an elective after a year of no Spanish classes. This is not an easy class. Plan for HW everyday including 2 research papers & 2 movie responses. He talks a lot, but that's good - you need to hear Spanish to learn. He's actually kind. Pop quizes. 2 exams-prompts in advance (: Ask questions in class! He will answer them thoroughly!", "Could not write any faster. Very unhelpful, poor attitude towards teaching probably wanted to be something else than a teacher. Childish in his actions and word. REALLY BAD TEACHER", "He doesn't teach bird courses. Teaches some tough material, but every lecture and the whole course are always well-organized and well-structured. The structure is your friend. Use it, you'll get a good Paciocco mark.", "Great class,good professor the class is not hard at all..He is a very understanding person :) He shows alot of interesting documentaries that will be useful during final.. Keep up with class discussions and read a bit from the book and you'll do good.", "WE NEED A REVOLUTION! Edge is the coolest old guy ever! he is so funny, yes he does ramble on about current events, but he challanges his students to think outside of their own little boxes. show up for class and use the study guide for an easy A! he has inspired me to become politically active&aware to make this world a better place ~Doc", "Fey's problem is he treats students like intelligent adults, and at IVC most aren't.", "Nightmare. Emotionaly unstable. Clueless. Makes class a stressfull and intolerant environment full of anxiety and fear.", "Hands down the best A&P teacher at VSCC. He's infinitely knowledgable and doesn't just read from slides -- he physically teaches on a chalk board. Extra credit is available on tests as long as you really put effort into studying the material. Sometimes it feels like he's moving too slow, but it's all because he cares about student comprehension.", "On of the Greatest Professor in this Department. I enrolled in every class he taught, because it is a guarantee that you will learn. He does give a lot of work and all his classes are a challenge.", "worst professor ever. he speaks to the board, mumbles, makes mistakes often, can't explain things to the class, gets frustrated when he's asked questions, barely speaks english. HORRIBLE! despite all of that the only reason I got an A was because it was easy math. but going to class made me want to hurl an eraser at his head.", "This class wasn't too difficult. The exams are pure memorization so if you memorize the notes, its really easy to get an A. He is sometimes unclear in the lectures, but he really knows what he's talking about. Class was sometimes boring and attendance wasn't mandatory", "A lot of information but not too bad. He's a really nice teacher and willing to help out his students no matter what.", "No Comments", "I love Professor Bartel. I thought he was such an interesting prof.

Very approachable.", "i took this guy 6 years ago. Get out of this major if possible. He is an idiot and uses the information that the students from previous years researched. does not check for facts, and grades solely on presentation, not content. he will not help you do anything in the entertainment industry that you could not have done without a college education", "An easy teacher a few homeworks but no test. You will leave this class actually learning something.", "His test is hard. The pre-test is not helpful a lot! There are 95 multi-choices questions, which drive me crazy!", "Can be dry at times, but a nice guy overall. \"Wizard of Whitmore.\" Can be funny. Great attitude. Knows what he's doing and teaches very well.", "Avoid at all costs! His lectures consist of him reading from essays he probably wrote 20 years ago. There is little to no direction for assignments. There was no proper syllabus. You are given three thick reading kits and left to decide what to read on your own. This is a prof who should've retired ten years ago.", "i love scanlin, he's sooo nice and really cares about his students.", "This professor is very knowledgeable, but has a very hard time dumbing things down. You have to be able to teach yourself a lot of stuff. This is not an easy class,(a tip: seek out psych profs for help). He's always trying to make jokes, they are never seem funny, but it's amusing. It's required for psych majors so good luck! Don't give up!", "Dr. Rimes is the best lecturer in the department. He's a good guy to talk to during office hours as well. The only concerns I have with him as a teacher is that sometimes his assignments are unclear, and he seems a little disorganized with his paperwork (your HW and tests)", "This class is basically SMO 201 with a little more description into HR practices. I hate this class with this professor because it provides generalized material with a teach who can not decide on a steadfast and concrete answer. Once you question his analysis, he holds a grudge.

They control your grade...steer clear of Naus", "Awesome Guy. Kiss up to him and you will get an easy A+. He doesn't really care about the work. He cares about attendance though, he makes fun of people who don't show up. He just tells stories all day in class and doesn't put stress on people AT ALL. Take him for ANY CLASS he teaches.

Only complaint is time granted on the tests. Overall great class.", "Turned out to be an easy class. I took it because I had to, not because I wanted to. Very helpful teacher and very easy to learn from.", "Dr. Ibrahim is a truly a great professor. The material he covers isn't easy but he makes sure that he explains it in a way in which the whole class will understand. Although the homework isn't mandatory, it really helps you grasp the main idea of the material and he also uses it as extra credit towards your final grade! Hard but not impossible!", "One of my favorite English classes ever. Zorn is very helpful and a brilliant instructor. He has some great stories to tell and you can learn a lot from him.

Wonderful mentor and you can learn a lot from him if you try.", "He is a very helpful and nice professor.", "HARD. Very impersonal. You'll feel like you're failing for at least the first month. You learn a LOT, but there are better professors in this department.", "He is so boring that it is everything I can do not to fall asleep in his class.

Goes fast but keeps it interesting", "Heywood is an absurdly easy prof, his attitude is \"your grade is what matters, not how you get it\", so all the tests are online, you can do them in groups, the quizzes have exact questions a few days ahead of time online, etc. That said, he's funny, smart, and not hard to listen to in lecture. And he's got an epic beard. Total badass", "Panzarella has the weirdest grading system and his lectures are long, boring, and irrelevant. A small writing assignment is due everyday but it is so easy.

Its simple. Don't make it hard on yourself.", "Very good professor. Always willing to talk outside of class.

His true/false and multiple choice questions were tricky though.", "Tried hard, was geniunely nice guy, material was taught via \"think about it, it's obvious, all you have to do is visualize it\" which didn't work too well for me...but at least he cut us some slack and recognized that we tried....and passed us!", "By far the best professor I've had the privilege to have at Denison. He's so enthusiastic about Biochemistry, and he will do whatever it takes to help you learn/understand, even if that requires him losing sleep. His understanding and willingness to help really made me want to do well in this class. If you get the chance, take a class with him!", "He's a great guy. Just impossible to get 80+ in. Class average will be around a low 70 no matter what. You will get no higher than a 75 on the term paper. He's an amazing lecturer, that's it. Final is extremely difficult too.", "One of the best teachers I have ever had. Better than 90% of the teachers I had at a certain unnamed private college I paid $100,000 to attend.

It's college!", "As a person at MDC, he is the greatest. As a teacher, he is the toughest. He is very funny but his test are even funnier if you do not study.

He should not take it out on us ! I'll bet money he's the one who posted those last two comments about himself. Please seek help Glennon and get the hell out of DePaul ........**** !", "Avoid Talham at all costs,he is an extremely uninvolved professor. I believe that he does care about chemistry and teaching, however, he has not displayed that this semester. His exams had nit-picky details and he went at a considerably faster pace than all the other teachers for this course. The only practice exams provided were over 10 years old", "Very knowledgeable on the subject, amusing way of communicating. All around a nice dude.", "Ernie obviously knows what he's talking about and is very arrogant at times. However, I find him very helpful and he is always willing to go over things again, even though he looks at you like you're stupid. Not an awful class.", "Horrible! Always late to class and lectures are not clear at all.", "great professor. hilarious in a nerdy way. very hard class, but you learn a LOT", "Save yourself the headache. If you are late, you'll probably sit in the corner with a dunce hat. He'd make people sit along the wall if they were late. He spontaneously picks on people, it just gets annoying.

You'll feel like you never graduated H.S. or that you're in the twilight zone.", "No Comments", "kinda arrocant but a good teacher", "Awesome class", "Grout has to have been the best professor I have had here. I am in my 3rd year here and still touch base with him. He was a great help my first year at college and, as someone has stated, is a very valuable asset to this college.", "AT first I thought he was a little nuts. First day of class he told us all he had alzheimers. He turned out to be a really cool guy though. You don't have to sit thru class just go in and take your test every class. Easy A! And an interesting class. Recommended....", "All he does is put up overheads and babble on for hours about things we don't know about, and not in a way for us to learn. Then there's the random stories he just goes off on.", "Nice guy but old school; wastes time transferring lecture notes on the black-board when he could simply use the overhead. One easy paper but petty points deducted for grammar etc. Very rigid with grading; no extra credit offered. If you're borderline A he will not give you credit, so B it is, most other prof's would give you the A for participating", "Online course. Posted NO course info until 3 weeks after course began. Sent rude and generally incomprehensible emails. Moved up due dates without notice. Repeatedly mentions that he went to law school. Brand new & already a horrible professor.", "KNOWS HIS STUFF> Passionate! not your average professor! HIGHLY reccomend his class! His class made my decision to be a Soc major, YOU WILL LOVE IT!", "Welcoming and informative. Plays music before class sometimes. Class consisted of lectures and a weekly quiz.

One of the best teachers I've had in my lifetime.", "AMAZING! take him for 415, he knows what he is doing. GPA booster", "Overall, I think he is a good professor and I would take him again. He tried to help people understand and would give bonus points on test to help keep average up. He was vague on how he was grading was going to be in the end. Most people did bad on project.", "Besides the fact that he mumbles constantly and gives hard tests, the class wasn't too bad. The lab boosts your grade and he grades tests on a curve. Lectures were somewhat interesting but a lot of people failed... then again there was quite a few stupid questions asked by the students during lectures, so you can't blame it all on him.", "Professor Jerolmack is hands down one of the best professors at Hunter! Take his class you won't regret it!!", "I signed up for this cities course not expecting much out of it - but it grew on me so much that I enjoyed coming in to class.

He made the subject interesting and used thought provoking questions and great examples. I would look for this teacher for future classes.", "Very Helpful and provides very good powerpoint visual aids", "Professor Williams give fair tests but requires a lot out of his students. Computer assignments (mandatory grade of C+ or higher to pass) take very long to complete (10+ hours) and are only worth 10% of the final grade. Lectures can often be off topic and hard to follow as he moves fast. With preparation and studying this class can be an A however.", "Neil is a great professor. Very passionate about students and the material. All tests and quizzes are online.

He will willing to help and clarify anything if needed.", "Dr. Roda is not at all the way most of these reviews make him sound. I don't know how much easier he could make it seeing as he gives you all the test and quiz questions ahead of time. He also offeres to help with any questions you have. In my experience he was a very nice enjoyable teacher.", "Good teacher, though class can sometimes get a bit monotonous. If you need help with anything, he's always happy to answer and he also holds study sessions for tests. His tests don't throw random curveballs and are based on important concepts in physics.", "Listening to Prof. Amrine is dumbfounding--he's so passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches. Take the class! He lets your rewrite papers until you get an A and is reasonably open-minded with what you can write about. Overall, he's genius.", "Ruined a fun class.

I read the textbook and still didn't do very good on the quizes.", "Homework is too long, you can't understand what he says, he dislikes you if you disagree with him, if he doesn't like you he gives you zero participation points - there's not that many ways to participate in his class. he just rambles a lot about nothing.", "Very nice guy, def. a little to smart for his own good, but never had a prof so willing to help! TONS OF reading, but it is intresting, def. a class that you couldn't fall asleep in!", "So passionate about the subject and his students. Just a really good professor.", "75% of the grade was PAs which were group based. If you got a bad group you had to do a ton of work on your own. It is able to be done solo if you have a lot of time. Tests were straightforward and all from material taught in class. Show up and pay attention, know how to program in C, and you'll get an A. Tjaden is a nice guy and willing to help.", "there really is never a dull moment with dennis around! he not only teaches a class but he makes sure that you are LEARNING. some of the other NIMS profs. should follow his lead.", "Glen is a goof ball. He's super clear and very understanding of the students. He talks A LOT and often repeats things, but at least you wont forget what's going onwhen tests are. If you practice for the SIMnet quizzes you will pass. The lecture quizzes were a little more difficult, but probably cause I didn't always pay attention during lectures.", "He never gives real homework assignments. Your grades are based solely on a few papers and the tests you write. He is very vague about what is going to be on the test, and reviewing just confused me more. Nice guy but needs to clarify what we exactly need to know succeed in the class.", "He is an awesome prof! Took him during ext spring semi and got an A. He is super easy!!!!! He goes over what will be on the exam and makes you prepared! Only thing I didn't like were the videos because they were kind of boring. But overall I recommend him!! I wish he taught more courses so I can take him again! EASY A!!!", "I had Dr. Taylor for Intro. to African American Family.

For the most part, if you read the textbook and really study the material you can do good on the tests. You have to read two short books and do a group project, reflection, and quiz on them. The inquisitive assignments are impossible to fail.", "Is all about proofs of theroms, does not grade exam solutions, but actual work -ALERT to ti89 users-. Actually grades HW, again if you cannot prove it, its wrong. Constantly reminds importance of math profiency in engineering. By far hardest professor yet. I was the sole student to pass the class of 15.", "Awesome person. Really nice guy. However, I agree with the boredom factor. He is soooo sweet, but I've never meet someone more monotonous in my life; it's torturous... but, like the others, I do recommend him.", "Recommend Rick 120%. His American Gov course was amazing; he gave very interesting and sometimes even entertaining lectures, and he makes the course very relatable to one's self. It was definitely not what I thought it would be--I had imagined a boring, textbook-reading heavy class--and I appreciate his way of teaching so much. Gotta love Rick.", "really easy course, had him for both lecture and lab. never any homework. he basically tells you exactly what's on the exams. final isn't cumulaive. he's really monotoned though so have fun staying awake.", "Dr. Kuhlman is a fantastic professor; he is chair of both the chemistry and biochemistry departments and so can provide fantastic examples for his teaching from both physical and life sciences. He doesn't appear to sleep. We receive emails from him at 2 in the morning, and then another at 5:30 AM. He holds regular and on demand review sessions.", "Take any class you can with him. I got my first B in Math since 6th grade. Tests aren't bad and his isn't strict.", "Nice guy, not very helpful.", "I usually dont rate professors on here, but I felt like I needed to let people know that David rayson is possibly the best professor you will probably ever come across in your life.

He was very good at explaining the information though, and was willing to help you, as long as you don't tick him off with stupid questions. be respectful and inquisitive and you'll do fine", "This guy is a complete ****. Try to switch out of his class if at all possible. Everything that everyone has said below is true, and for me it was even more. He has no respect for his students or their lives and thinks that his class should revolve around him.", "confuses everything, although information is directly from the book. Drops lowest quiz, but they carry heavy weight in terms of your final grade!!", "great professor, he gives all your work in advance, all his work is clear. only bad thing is he does not respond to emails and the exams are extremely confusing and hard.", "Harvey isn't arrogant- he is just extremely intelligent. World Politics is not a light subject and he expects that people are intelligent enough to see both sides of arguments. Loved his class- he was super helpful when I emailed him a question and I believe my exams were marked very fairly (the final was difficult)", "One of Pych prof's told me that Wayne suspended him once for failing more than half the class. He's HARDER than hell. This is a PhD psych level class- not a beginning psych level class!!! He's beyond difficult and gives very FEW A's and B's. Don't take him unless you want a \"D\" or \"F!\"", "at the beginning of the course, he was a super nice guy, funny.

Just show up and pay attention and it's fine.", "Excellent teacher, photographer and software author.", "Dan is hot but he is a loner and does have an egotistical side. He does think that he knows it all and he is good w/ communications but not good w/ people in general", "not only is dr. anthony stewart an unreasonable professor, but the man is, simply put, a pompous ass. he stalks over his lectures like some intellectual giant, when in reality he is just another run-of-the-mill professor who takes himself too seriously. his classes are always filled with racial overtones as well, and he'll constantly remind you he'", "Teacher is passionate about what he teaches, very thorough and explains what is expected for the exams, assignments and homework.", "do a diddy diddy dum diddy do...", "Jorgensen...Interesting character. The class is very unique and very unlike any other class on campus. Interactivity is upon your interest. If you raise critical questions, discussions can make you ponder even after the class. We went out to a movie and dinner as a class. If you are on waitlist, don't count on it.", "Really good professor, knows what he's talking about. Willing to work with you, Tests kinda hard and Expects a lot but makes it fun. If you pay attention you will do well in the class. Has you make a Language for this class as final project.", "Favorite teacher on campus. Challenging but fair. His high opinion is motivating to do your best work. By far the best class I've taken at Denison was \"Antislavery\" 290. Really intelligent, approachable, helpful. Had us to his house for dinner. LOVE MITCH.", "He has a unique attitude. You never know how he'll react to a situation. But more often than not, it won't be to your liking.", "Lectures are long but he is so passionate about his subject!

The class is counted by points. There are a lot of projects. one essay.", "Tim Hill rocks! His teaching method was a bit unconventional this semester. He made us, the students, teach ourselves. His tests are pretty hard but he curves the midterm and final so don't sweat it. The best advice I can give is attend class and make sure to participate in WebCT.", "I would take him again now that I understand his grading and standards. They aren't made clear in the syllabus so it took a while. Only two quizzes, but they are definitely challenging. Essays are hard to figure out at first, but there are 5-6 (200word), and a discussion every week. Overall, not a bad class, just depends on your preference.", "This was the last class of my degree and certainly one of the best -- if not the best! He's an interesting lecturer. Excellent course material. Puts in the effort to provide helpful written comments. Willing to discuss the readings with students in person after class.", "Great professor, by far the best one I have had for an online class. About 4 essays throughout the class but makes it clear of what he expects. Gives feedback, even if it is just to say it was a good essay, which I believe means a lot.", "he is a funny guy, but thats not what the class should be about! he doesnt teach anything...at all. he just copies problems onto the board straight from the book and then tells a story about his son. he isnt very good at answering questions either.", "Prof. Simmonds is the best. He makes class interesting and fun!!!! I got a B from him and I hate English. I would recommend anyone to take him if you don't like English.", "I owe him a great part of my success in grad school. I was lucky to have the chance to have him for 3 courses through which I learned a lot and found great interest in sociology. He is an intellectual and an experienced, inspiring, and helpful prof.

Overall, he's a pretty decent professor. Not terribly easy, not terribly difficult. Just decent.", "By far one of my favorite professors. He can be a little strict with guidelines and rules but he is always willing to help, great at keeping the class attention, and teaches well. You can see that he loves what he does but he also takes it seriously.", "A great professor for a great class! If you do all the work and study sufficiently for the test, it's an easy A.

J-term Media in the World. He made a 3 hr class fun and interesting. Enjoyed going to class. Heavy use of textbook but gave us questions that would be on final day before final. On top of that he's a really nice and cool guy.", "One of the two best teachers I've had at Cal.

He makes the class fun and he is really laid back.", "from what i gather classes before mine seemed to have taken advantage of duane, or at least he felt like they did. so then he made it too difficult...not worth the stress esp. if you reading humidity graphs and such is not going to be part of your life in the future. stay away.", "His class was a lot of work - a reading and a writing assignment for every class. The great part is the class is over before you know it. He is a fair, but not easy grader. He's a very compassionate person and it will help your grade if you agree with those sentiments.", "Dr. Hupp is amazing!

Lots of interactive class discussions on a wide range of topics (school/life related, etc.) Never needed to take notes for this class..ever. Weekly assignments due, very short (500 words) and easy. A couple of longer papers due at the end but not hard at all. Great prof. RECOMMENDED!!", "Good lecturer. The presentations do get dull sometimes but you can't expect much from the subject on databases. I had a clear understanding what would be on the exam and the grades looked pretty good. If you do the expected work then the grade should be high. The final project was rather interesting and turned out pretty well for our group.", "Overall easy. Show up to class and things go all right. Sometimes the test questions weren't worded very clearly. Was somewhat unapproachable outside of class.

Really inconsistent grading, never keeps track of papers after you turn them in, and never fully explains assignments. Never makes himself available to talk or explain anything. Expects you to check your email every day but never responds to anything you send him. Also cancels/moves classes without much notice. Avoid him.", "Prof. Curtis is one of the my favorite professors I have taken thus far. I took his class 8:15 in the morning, but it was the best. He is very wise.

He is one of the funniest people I have ever met, you will def enjoy his class.", "Good luck if you have this professor - he is knowledgable but his class is so boring. I got an A, but by writing everything he said, even his boring stories because it will be on the test. Read the book because you will be teaching yourself.

Really enjoyed his class.", "If you want an A - take this class! He is extremely knowledgeable in his field, but not real computer saavy.

No final-just show up to get your final grade.", "This man is the absolute worst professor I've ever had the displeasure of interacting with. Arrogant doesn't begin to describe him.

All I can say is don't take it with him.", "Very interesting, \"Can you hear me in the back? OK! And thank you again for turning off your cell phones! Today we will be talking about...\" He goes pretty quickly but is easy to follow. Course is TOUGH for first year and it's to bad he isn't teaching it anymore.", "Jason's a great teacher and has become an important part of the Interactive Media Department. He knows how to motivate students and get them to look inward at themselves and question why they make art. I never really thought much about concept or history before I had him. He's really helped me to focus my voice. If you haven't taken him yet, do it!", "Great teacher - highly recommended. I didn't always go to class, but you can really get behind if you don't. Doing the homework really helps to get in gear for the tests. The tests aren't bad - except the final - which he has no control over and which I felt completely unprepared for. HOWEVER he gives a mighty curve for it.", "uptight teacher", "Professor Calderon is a great teacher. He really takes his time in explaining the material (Chicano History) and makes time to meet with you in case you got questions. I have taken several classes of his in the past, and I'm taking another one again. Great material and excellent professor.", "He's a very easy grader but this isn't an easy A. The classes are a bit tedious and repetitive, and if you don't have a solid background in statistics the readings can be confusing.", "HE DOESNT SEEM TO CARE ABOUT THE STUDENTS", "This guy knows he's smart. Seems to let you know too.", "He is a nice character, and he provides the questions before the tests, and also gives oportunities for group solving of his assignments. That's because the course itself is a very hard one, one of the hardest I've taken.", "Mr. Salvo is the coolest! He makes the hour and a half of community go by fast with his funny jokes and silly remarks. Take him if you can, he's a sweet old man!", "He is definately brilliant when it comes to technoculture and post-modernism and gives you a new perspective but I had a hard time following the material - put a lot of work into my papers for mediocre marks. Not an easy class, but fresh and new.", "I took this class online and passed with a B. You do have to put in the work but the professor is the best. Just make sure you keep up with your weekly assignments and quizzes. He provides study guides for both mid-term and final. You need only to buy the code for the book.", "I overall enjoyed Charles's class. However, he IS pretty disorganized at times. He does drone on often like people say but I really appreciate how passionate he is about what hes talking about. Hes flexible with late papers but hes also a tough grader!!! People complain about him being boring but hes a really nice professor and an invested guy.", "awesome professor. best that i have had yet.", "Peters was a tough professor. He assigned lots of textbook readings, along with supplementary materials every class period. He has pretty open office hours though & really knows his stuff. His class's definitely passable, but he's a teacher that makes you work for your grade & legitimately wants his students to learn, no matter how rough it may be.", "He is a great Pro., easy marker,very nice and helpful.", "This guy could cut class with his Adonis like stature, if you know what I am saying. Good teacher, very clear with instructions and just as helpful. I took two exams and did my homework. Homework is not graded, but it will help you in the long run. Hardest nips this side of the Mississippi!", "A midterm & a final, that's pretty much it. In every 2 classes, a sheet with 10 questions based on the chapters of the textbook is given. After completing the sheets, they are used as study guides for the midterm & final + both exams are multiple choice & true/false questions. Easy class, no HW &/or term paper.", "I had Cooke for a once a week class for population geography. I thought that he was entertaining and kept the class relatively light considering some of the material. Only 2 exams and a paper for grades. I enjoyed the class and so long as you attended and took a few notes, you will be prepared for the exams.", "Horrible teacher, not helpful, and completely rude. But I believe he has reasons behind his methods giving loads of busy work. I learned how to work diligently and get things done on time. I still hate him though.", "Most boring class i ever had, I never thought it's possible to fall asleep while making notes...and notes are not so helpfull, you better read al chapters twice with notes,then you'll be more or less fine. Questions are very tricky. Try to avoid this class.", "Don't buy the book, he never uses it. If you like listening about his son, great because that's all you are going to do! It was an easy class but I didn't care for him because all he talks about is himself and not what's on the test. It's an easy class though.", "An excellent teacher. He brings a sense of humour to the classroom that is sorely missed. He presents information in a clear manner, and openly encourages the class to participate in the lecture. This interaction is a great bonus. He certainly knows his stuff, and makes it available to all. The class I was dreading to take has become my favourite!", "DMIT-1508 has a very high fail rate. Shane makes this class awesome and fun. As long as you show up and PAY ATTENTION, you can do very well. I suspect the high fail rate is due to people browsing their Facebook or text messages in class. You're paying for the course, don't waste your chances.", "I really enjoyed having this class with Des. He's a really smart guy and it's interesting to hear everything he has to say. He always seemed to care about us as students and our opinions. You could tell he wanted us to be successful. He's sort of a quirky guy, so not everybody liked him. \"There's no such thing as a perfect paper!\"", "outstanding professor. Wants his students to learn and experience the subject, hard as all get out but you'll be ready for anything after him!", "While Bob Coleman's class was undoubtedly one of the most difficult I have taken, with high expectations and a large workload, I can honestly say it was one of the best classes I've taken at SSU. I am more proud of the work I did in this class than in any other. Bob also puts an incredible amount of work and effort into his classes.", "Very intimidating and impatient.. would not recommend him for beginners. :(", "Everyday is a class discussion & it's SUPER easy. You couldn't have an easier class. He takes attendance everyday, but only has class on Mon & Wed for the MWF class. You turn in a two paragraph research paper instead of coming on Friday & it's so simple. He reads off the answers for his tests, so write down what he says. Easy A.", "pretty easy class, will cuve grades. not very interesting, make sure to do all reading. will occasionally give extra credit for attendance.", "Jim is the coolest... rock on ROWDY", "Overall, the class is manageable. If you want him to help you, you'll have to go out of your way to ask for it. Exam questions can be worded a bit tricky, but they're all pretty much the same. His voice is funny and he speaks in a drawn out manner.", "Awesome class....great teacher.", "Jay Ko will not pamper you, he will teach you to destroy math though. I will be taking him for calc.", "nice guy but boring, notes are useless just read the textbook or the summary at the end of the chapter if your lazy like me. tests are onfusing but gives a nice curve. when i seen i got a A- i was really happy.gives you an optional paper but its long and woud of been a waste of time for me", "Civil Procedure is boring as hell, but since you have to take it, pick McNevin...he's funny and will make the material interesting", "Karthik is the best professor at Tech. There really should be more teachers like Karthik! He gives ample time to complete assignments and tests are open book/notes and for unlimited time! Shame on you if you don't do well in his class.", "watch out for those short shorts of his", "Not only is he easy, but he completely makes you understand the subject. One time my car broke down on the road and he fixed it for me. Knows his way through Windows and Linux systems. Incredible memory of C++ programming and data structures. Asset!", "As others have stated, there are rediculous amounts of work for what you will get out of it. It is hard to teach something that you have never been involved in. Much of the material we went over was not relavent, plus outdated. EM majors must take him so don't waste your time with a EM major. Both classes were a waste.", "Oh my god a professor that actually challenges his students more than a high school teacher and covers the material in depth as fits the job ... lets all get online and write bad reviews because somebody assumed that we were actually intelligent enough to handle being taught like adults.", "VERY EASY CLASS. Gotta go to lecture to get the lecture notes tho. Midterm/Final are multiple choice with only option a,b,c. The discussion counts for 50% of your grade, and the discussion labs are supper easy. Plus, this class is real interesting, DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TAKING THIS CALSS", "he does not explain or review anything..i found myself looking on the computer for help!!! take another prof quick!!", "No Comments", "He is laid back and makes the math very easy to understand", "Really disengaged prof. He's got high regard for his own ideas, but little time and patience for anyone who disagrees with him. Shows very little interest in student success, and does not make himself (or his TA's) accessible for any kind of assistance outside of lecture. Acts like he doesn't want to be there, and really couldn't care less.", "First off, Dr. Snider is hilarious! He adds humor to the chemistry which makes it a lot more bareable. The only complaint is that he grades formal labs extremely hard - it's almost impossible to get an A. Luckily, the other assignments will boost your grade and he was always willing to answer questions inside & outside of class.", "Prof Fruscione is a great teacher! Really fun and simple class, read books and watch the film adaptations and write a paper about it. You can pick your own topic for the 10 page paper at the end and he's always open for questions. Even though we can miss class, I went to most of them because we always had good discussion. Highly recommended", "AVOID at all costs, this guys grading system is the most messed up thing Ive ever seen, the first two tests are nothing compared to the final, during class he went to Europe for some reason and gave us lectures to learn on our own. Whenever you try to ask a question in class he ignores you unless you yell at him.", "Very confusing at times. I would have no idea what he was talking about. He likes to jump around a lot. Tends to \"forget\" things a lot. Stuff like \"oh yeah you need to know this to do this problem but i forgot to teach it to you.\" Is a very interesting person though and has some funny stories.", "aloof", "Dr. Kuhlman is a great professor! He is helpful, willing to make time if you need assistance, and is really clear on what he expects of you.", "You will learn a lot from his class", "Unfortunately, you have to take this class for this major...so sorry! I was lost the whole time.", "He is ok. 4, 6 page essays. 4 exams. Exams are a bit tricky but not impossible if you study. He canceled class a total of 5 times. Nice guy. He is alright.", "You must attend class or you will miss something you need to know for the test. He just talks at you the entire time. Try to keep up with notes and start studying days in advance for the test. Use the study guide, very helpful. If i were you id get a different teacher.", "He is unlike any other math professor. This class had many challenging concepts, but he was always insistent on making it fun (ie to learn about hyperbolic geometry, he brought in pringles)! He learns your name quickly and is always very personable. If you have to take a hard math class, take it from him!!", "Tests are way too hard", "Amazing, brilliant professor who challenges you to learn. Tells you exactly what to do. Won't let idiots monopolize class time. I wish more professors would shush the narcissists like that. Very concerned for students while pushing you to use your brain, make it work, and improve your ability to figure things out for yourself.", "He's an awful teacher. Everyone I know is failing his class. His lectures are not only brutally boring, but useless as well. He created a study guide that was absolutely useless and the majority of the class failed the test.", "Great teacher cares about students gives extra credit to boost grade. review for every exam. take him easy A. he will not stress you.", "crazy curve, a lot of notes but as long as you are a good note taker then you will do fine. i would definately recommend him. GREAT PROF.", "Well. Took two weeks for the syllabus, a week and a half to split up into groups that you literally will never talk to. He does not know how to answer questions well, however does give extra points back on exams if many people argue the questions.", "Probably the most boreing class i have ever had to sit through...if it wasnt for his WEEKLY F***ING quizes on BS i would have never gone. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!", "Just wow. I wish that I could take his class for the rest of my college career. We explored campus, talked about everything, and you really get to bond with everyone in class. If you show up you get an A+ b/c he wants to inspire you to get what YOU want out of the class, which makes most people actually care about the assignments. TAKE THIS CLASS!", "Camilo is the man. If you're serious about learning all things film this is the man to learn from. He will be tough on you and he's very straightforward but it is for your own good. If you don't enjoy and take something from his classes then you are in the wrong field.", "Tjaden is extremely smart and really knows his stuff, but this class is hard. There is a ton of individual work to be done. His lectures are helpful, but google honestly helped me way more than his lectures.", "He may know the material but he is not very good at communicating it to the class. The lectures are unorganized, often off the subject. The tests are written on the fly, and often contain too many real-world examples that are impossible to solve.TAs great", "I loved professor Cuevas! I will take him again! He does expect you to try in his class, but if you put in effort to the class, he will see that and give you a grade to reflect that. I have had teachers here that will not give you a good grade to be contrary, but professor Cuevas is always open to helping, and to hearing new opinions. Take him!", "hes really funny and cool, I would love to take him again", "BEST Professor I've ever had. SOO Encouraging, Humerous and Genuinely Sweet. Highly recommended for any and all courses he teaches. Master of MANY FORMS OF MARTIAL ART....", "never have I met such a cold hearted man... merry Christmas to you too bruce.", "Extremely boring teacher. All that he does is stand in front of the room and read the powerpoints. His test are pretty hard, but if you study you should at least get a c on them. Go to class and do the online forum, and they will boast your grade. You should at least get a c in the class if not a B.", "Instead of \"V\" for Vyse, I accidentally clicked on \"B\" for boring. No lie. I suggest learning to sleep with your eyes open. He's nice but scatterbrained and his classes (I took 101 and 201) aren't particularly hard.", "I took online, pretty difficult. A lot of discussions and reading and writing. Barely passed.", "He's not a bad teacher, just slightly boring. It's possible to make an A in his class if you study hard for his tests, complete the forum assignments and submit the 5 page paper at the end of the semester.", "Terrible at explaining key concepts. Makes uncomfortable and inappropriate sexual jokes, or at least did for my classes. Nice dude though.", "Michael is an amazing prof. He definitely picks favourites and his acting class if physically challenging but, if you take the work seriously, he will respect you for it. Overall, a fantastic theatre teacher.", "Professor is very nice and care students but the contents are absurd (Complicated Universe is trying to be shown within one semester) and test questions are enormous within limited time All in all, you will not even expect where does the questions come from d(^_^o)", "had for calc and topics in math, VERY VERY GOOD! would definitely recommend. the COOLEST teacher you will ever have, both in class and out, without a doubt. TAKE HIM!!!", "Second only to Walker in bad history profs. Scattered and unclear, and his French accent makes it impossible to understand anything. Also screws up names and dates all the time. I leave class more confused then when I go there. He seems like a decent guy, but nonetheless, should be writing books not lecturing.", "An interesting class. It usually held my attention. Several of us tried to figure out what country he was from, but we couldn't. His accent was unique. His lectures are understandable, though.", "Really good professor, lots of reading to do and its a heavily lecture based class but he tries really hard to relate to his students and makes you laugh a little too. overall good guy", "This class requires as much studying and class prep. as does Organic Chem. You will have a quiz every class. You have a huge plant collection to do on top of large comprehensive exams. I learned a great deal in this class, but still would not recommend it unless you are a work-a-holic", "Very boring professor, his exams are half essay, half multiple choice. His only classes seem to meet once a week, avoid missing classes. Very poor time management, with holidays, we got to the final week with 10 chapters of material left. Extremely difficult to get in touch with as well. Take Schupp.", "No Comments", "Great guy who cares about his students. He will do anything to help you and is very approachable.", "Dr. Nelson was very passionate and loved engaging everyone on bi-weekly hikes. What I did not like was his attitude and the grading scale. He had good & bad days and they were unpredictable. Grading wise, 7 genus and species identifying practicals and 7 quizzes were weighted the same. Entire class was out of 300 pts. Near impossible to get an A.", "Fantastic prof. Intelligent and enthusiastic. Loved the hippo costume", "What can I say that hasn't already been said? Mike is a wonderful guy and a great professor. Designed the entire course and materials himself with the students in mind. Essentially a self paced class. I actually learned a ton of great excel skills too! Imagine that, a course that is low stress, relatively easy, and where you learn valuable skills.", "Great professor. Very helpful and cares a great deal about his students. Very knowledgable professor probably the smartest man I know. He is kind of soft spoken but he knows what he is talking about and is willing to help", "Harding is definitely one of the better English profs on campus. He is extremely intelligent and his English accent isn't bad to listen to either. He really appreciates when his students go to him for help and participate in class. Went to his office hours once for help on a presentation and he guided me through the whole thing. GO TO CLASS.", "Disorganized. His lecture slides are all over the place. But very understanding in terms of deadlines.", "This professor is ill educated in the line of his teaching. I feel as though he was a waste of my tuition and time. I would not ever take him as a professor again nor would I recommend him to anyone else. Never was well prepared for classes, and the students seemed to teach more than him.", "This guy is soooo funny! Always making us laugh! He's very helpful when you need his help, too. If I had one word to describe him.... Quirky", "Class was an easy A for me. I went 3 times (test days) and got an A. Tests are written essays and I always crammed 3 days before (It worked for me). Here's how you get an A... GO TO SI AND TA SESSIONS, email TA's about outline and thesis, study with flashcards, write 10-15 pages for essay (It sounds scary but it's easy to do), 10/10 would recommend", "The tests are long and include anything he may have mentioned in class and from the reading. In addition, each question has 6 to 9 choices. However, if sufficient notes are taken, this class is not hard at all. Fall asleep or miss a lecture and a few questions on the test are not answerable.", "Great class, but there's a lot of reading to keep up with.", "He is one of the best teachers at Salisbury. He knows what he teaches, he loves what he teaches and he cares. He is by far and away a great teacher and I hope he keeps it up for a long time.", "I would recommend this teacher. The forum assigments do not take up much time and the 2 papers that are due are not very difficult either. All in all the tests are the hardest because it is timed and isn't just definitions. You have to understand the concepts. He curves the grades too!", "good but boring teacher", "If you are just looking for an easy grade, this is your man. However, I was looking for a history teacher and not someone out to push his own political agenda. If I wanted Glenn Beck to teach me history, I would watch more Fox News. I felt this class was an insult to me, my intelligence, and a complete waste of my time.", "Cool prof and very fair!", "I wish that I could take a class from this man every semester of my school career. Papers? Too hard. Tests? Too hard. Readings? Too many. But man, did I learn a lot. Thanks Ralph.", "great at pushing you to do your best. a great teacher overall, although very blunt and sometimes unfair. excellent at conceptual ideas.", "Hard, but worth it if you want to learn to be a teacher.", "Easily one of the best (ILR) professors out there. The way he teaches eliminates the need for traditional math or calculations, and instead, requires you to critically think and understand data. He's exceptionally smart, but very approachable. Tests are fair, but can be tricky; grades are curved at the end.", "Respected, organized and professional. He gives over hard concepts in a clear manner. It's a focused setting.", "Currently enrolled in his Inorganic course and he is absolutely amazing. Yes, you will need to study. Yes, the exams can be a bit tricky. It's all about the time you put into studying. He's a great lecturer and you should focus on studying the hw (not graded) he assigns. He's very helpful during office hours as well. 10/10", "Dr. G is a very funny and approachable guy. He is interesting in his lecture but it is very hard to follow what he is saying sometimes. He is kind of scattered in his lecture and it is hard to remember everything from lecture. Sometimes you find the book more interesting than his lectures.", "cool guy, but we were told he would scale grades at the end (esp considering most of the class was getting 60/70 averages on the tests) but he didnt curve in the end. interesting class, but in the end it ended up hurting my gpa and just causing more stress in my life, not worth it if you're simply searching for another lab science credit", "Played favorites - would spend 15 minutes helping one person and 1 minute helping another, always said he wanted your creation to be \"simple\" but always favored the elaborate projects, acted as if projects were very open-ended but then acted as if they had to be done his way", "I thought taking a 3 hour long class would be difficult to get through each week, but Salloway is so interesting and intriguing and always looking to make jokes. He is very smart in general and has a deep passion for what he teaches. But, he is very judgmental of his students and a strange grader with unclear parameters.", "He's a smart guy and loves technology (most people his age are technophobes, so it's good he knows how to use a computer). His online tests are nice because you can retake them as many times as you want untill you get 100% (except the last test, the final). But he's soooo borring. I'd never fallen asleep in a class until I took his class in Fall of 2003. You can learn some good stuff if you pay attention, and that's a big if. Very dry and borring. Class isn't to hard though.", "Fantastic! This class teaches you a lot about the finer points in sociological theories. Take this calss only if you are interested in sociology theories. I would definitely recommend him over the other soci 381 professor. Tests are super easy. Papers a little trickier.

Absolutely A-F***ing-mazing teacher", "He is just a great Professor and do not hesitate to take his course. explains things well.", "Awesome guy, can be funny at times. has great discussion in class. lots of written work but fun class to be in", "\"Dr\" Davis my hiney!

Def take this class", "Unreasonably hard exam, fun fact, rivers macro econ filled up right after Hammond's final exam.", "Ovadia is a great professor and definately the one to take for theory. Obviously the class is really hard, but he does a great job of explaining all of the theories and theorists. There are a couple of papers, but they aren't too hard and he's not too hard of a grader. Great teacher!", "He's the real deal! He occasionally misses class because he has been flown to dangerour wartorn parts of the world where his expertise is required. He once had to leave early to catch a flight but was enjoying the class discussion. When a student reminded him he had a flight to catch he said, \"It's ok. It's a military flight. They'll wait.\"", "I had him for small groups. What a great guy but boy is he boring as I don't know what.

Not a decent woman in general.", "such an easy course if your at least somewhat smart", "A difficult teacher but fair. His tests are difficult and his lectures move quickly.

He is cool enough but a HARD MicroCcon class!", "Great teacher, but the class is so boring. This could have been an online class. YOu need to come to class or you will fail.", "I loved this class. Mr. Dinneen knows his stuff, and presents it in a way that actually makes it interesting. His tests are not easy, but he gives several opportunities for extra credit towards the end of the semester.

Show up, take good notes, and you'll be fine.", "Don't argue with him, just \"believe\" what he tells you and write about it. You'll do fine.", "John Burton is an amazing storyteller and a very funny guy. He started off one of his lectures with \"the first time i had malaria...\" I liked one day when he put away his notes and told stories the whole time. Dance major in college, no less...", "The easiest guy you could have found in the whole Brooklyn College English department for this course. I was lucky to have found him, we read couple of stories wrote two papers and one final paper for the semester, and the entire class got an A. Thats Amazing and Kool. He is not teaching any more, but we need Professors like him.", "Dr. G is hilarious! He likes to tell personal stories which helps you remember the material. The lectures can get long and boring, but that's because the class is an hour and a half. There are only three exams total, all of which are online. There are also two projects. The only downfall to this is that you can't lose more than 13 points for an A", "Mr. Tiefenwerth is a very good professor. His reviews are extremely helpful and very accurate towards the test. He is very fair and is willing to work with anyone.

Does his best to make a difficult class managable and useful, especially to ECON majors.", "Goads students in class, makes personal insults to better his ego.

Sometimes he gets confused, and be sure to go over the tests! Makes several mistakes on grading.", "Don Hood is an **** to all Freshmen.

This guy is a real ****!", "I came into this class knowing nothing and had a complete lack of interest in anything to do with computers. Now I am going to minor in Computer Science! Glenn was amazing and makes things understandable for those with little to no knowledge of computers. Lecture quizzes are tough, but the labs are what really saved my grade.", "i know he uses the scare tactics to weed out the bad students, but give me a break. he red flags me as a trouble maker just coz i actually came to lab on time. lab starts as stated on the schedule at 1:00. i come in at 12:59 says wait outside. bull. lectures are useless. stay home and read the book. also for your own sake take sato or gober for lab", "Despite the negative comments posted on here about the professor he is a very nice guy.

The tests are easier than the homework so if you pass these you should be fine :)", "Great teacher! Very funny and will answer any question you have without hesitation. Highly Recommended! A++", "This is the only class that was difficult for me to get through. He teaches well, but he has very strict rules and regulations. He also can be very rude and mean, anger like.

If you are going to be late: Just go to the UC. You'll get your feelings hurt if you walk in late. Papers must include what he wanted you to talk about (even though he didn't clarify this before you turned it in) Grading is not fair. Just says to try harder next time. Read all the text book and understand it for test.", "He is such a funny, quirky guy. In-class discussions are never boring. The readings were long at times, but so interesting; and he definitely provides a new perspective on the material that you may not have ever considered before. He is a great professor and will accept any argument as long as you can back it up with logical statements.", "Professor Potter was impersonal, was weeks/ months late in grading assignments, and was extremely disorganized. If not for what I knew from high school, I would not have passed this class. Over half of the students dropped out. I learned how to guess my way through unclear assignments and how to use his last-minute feedback in my prepared essays.", "I'm taken his next semester for TWO different classes. No test, and lot of movies. He is Great, lay back over all a very good teachers. You will not fail", "Burge is the man! Loved taking this class with him. There is no assigned textbook for this class so all material is straight from lectures. Has a tendency to \"wonder\" at times during discussions but overall, very pleased.

In my class, the lowest 'class average' was like 86.", "Hard as hell, but I learned a lot.", "Not the best teacher around, but a nice guy. Amazing knowledge of subject matter. Do all the readings and go to class and you should do well. Willing to help in office hours/after class. Test questions can be either overly vague or demand an unreasonable amount of detail. Okay overall class.", "Absolutely amazing professor! A wonderful person as well! Labs are very easy marks and his exams are extremely fair! :)", "Hes an amazing marker! U cant fail his course", "He tells you exactly how to get an A, you have to work for it but if you're willing it's right there. He is always willing to talk to you, make accommodations, and really goes out of his way to help a student who asks for it. He says any version of the text book is fine but MAKE SURE YOU GET THE OLD VERSION.", "Great Professor. V. interesting class. Best prof at CMU!", "Interesting professor and class, not for the easily offended. Come to class, do as he ask, participate in class and you will get an A. He treats you like college students, not like high school students. Loved his class.", "No Comments", "It is hard to understand what the class subject is really about his lec are very boring most of the time he has a lot of info that he wants to share but often are just stories tha tdont relate. no tests, 3 commentaries and 3 short quizes attendance counts and will help your grade", "Great guy! Makes chem classes fun.", "Great for new law students. Not for the faint of heart, as the issues are esoteric, in volume, and there's really no time to fool around. Prof. Frey really cares about his students and those who study law. He is what he is: a no-nonsense professor who isn't there for fun and games, but one who is there to bash Kx into your mind!", "Dr. Neal was very funny. He is sorta awkward and nerdy, but in a good way. I enjoyed his class, becasue he was funny to be around, but he wasn't a very good teacher. I had a very strong calc. backround, and still had no freaking clue what he was ever talking about.", "Professor Fox is extraordinarily knowledgeable. However, his lectures are invariably delivered at a snail's pace, in a very dry monotone.", "As long as you do your work you will pass. He talks a lot and does not give tests (bio 11) You dont need to take notes at all. Just Be on time and dont be absent. He is very good about helping and explaining..Does contract class.", "Dr. Robert Bender is the best professor at UTD. He opens many ways to earn extra bonuses credits. There are 2 exams . 1 lowest grade drop. He gives a very good exams review with questions answers keys 4 days b4 the exam day so you can study it. At the end, no one left behind B. Thank you Dr. Robert Bender.", "he is an okay prof. he marks way too hard. he is pretty arrogant. i found his course too dificult. i am a good student.", "Best class ever. Best professor ever. David Huddle's classes are always great. He creates a wonderful and supportive atmosphere for workshopping. He is always respectful and constructive with criticism. He also has a great sense of humor. If you have an opportunity to take a class with him, do it!", "Excellent teacher. I have taken both his ASTR110 and ASTR111 and have enjoyed them both. He keeps his lectures interesting and well-paced throwing in the occasional corny joke. Just attend the lectures and make sure to study thoroughly before every test and the class is an easy A. So hurry up and take this class before he retires!", "Very humble, but very funny and full of wit. He is very knowledgeable and wants everyone to do well and actually learn. He is highly recommended.", "Jerry, as he insists on being called, is an excellent teacher and a great man. He really cares for his students and has a fun time getting to know them and teaching them. Holds plenty of review sessions for tests and will do whatever it takes to get you to pass as long as you try. Sometimes he's not crystal clear, but he will explain if asked.", "Professor Mitchell's class was my 1st college course taken in 18 years. His technique annoyed me at first, but once I got the hang of his style, he wasn't so bad. Read the book, follow the syllabus, and come to class and you will be fine. His stories are \"quite literally\" legendary!8-)", "Great teacher who clarifies any questions.", "very nice, reccomended fo sho", "Great lectures, he knows his stuff and is really passionate about the topics. The textbook was short and well written. A funny and engaging speaker, I will definitely take a course with him again.", "Fun teacher. Lots of discussion. NO reading. Definitely knows the subject well as he has had a lot of jobs in the field.", "Had him for Critical thinking and he is the least understanding individual on the planet. He fails utterly at the critical thinking aspect of his course. If you weren't agreeing with him he didn't like you. Also a ridiculous amount of online work. Stay away", "I think he might have retired by now but i had him for my Spring 2010 Eng 2 class. He made us buy this expensive book we used only for a while. During the semester he made us write only three stories and a final paper. And there it was we all got an A for his class. Not the best but not the worst either.", "Fred Stewart is one of best professors I've ever had! His class lectures are always interesting and keeps your attention. Class has 2 easy writing assignments and 4 tests that are easy because they cover vocabulary. Definitely an easy A if you put in a little effort. Don't have to take the final if your grade is high enough. Would take him again!", "He's an awesome professor. Very easy to get along with an interesting to listen to.", "Can his ideas work in the real world?", "He is a terrible professor. Some girls think he is hot, while some guys think he is cool. However, he is a rigid marker, a boring lecturer, and a cranky person. It's as if he gets off on trying to strike fear into some of his students.", "He's a great teacher and makes his lectures interesting but that's it. His way of grading is completely random and unjustified. He gave wrong instructions on what to focus on the midterm which resulted in a class average in the 50s. For the final we are supposed to value a stock without even having any complete financial statements.", "Just don't do it.", "I took Dr. Cooke's URBN 1200 course online over the summer. Dr. Cooke is pretty knowledgable and It was an interesting course. There was no textbook and he just had you do assigned readings on HuskyCT. Your grade was based on 12 writing assignments and your comments on other student's assignments and he dropped your two lowest scores.", "He's very easy, at times it's not required to show up at class, due to the fact the test questions come from the end of each chapter.", "He's an awesome teacher and he's so nice!! And he grades on what he calls the \"Canadian\" scale, where A's start at 80. He's great!!", "He's never around except for grading, so pray for a helpful TA. Makes sure every point is scrutinized.", "If you do what he ask of you, you should be fine. I really enjoyed the class, and the people who took the class with me were amazing. Just follow every instruction that he gives and you should be fine. I really enjoyed singing in front of the class.", "Forum Assignments are easy, test are timed and difficult. Don't expect any help from this professor.", "Lectures are clear and interesting - he is a good teacher and you'll learn a lot. Grades aren't just based on exams; he likes to have us write papers and have discussions, a nice break from lectures and exams. On exams and papers he is extremely picky. Make sure your definitions are word for word and your writing is as concise as possible.", "Great guy. Great Class. The schedule said this class met 3 times a week but he made it to only twice a week. Baker made class enjoyable even though it was a 9am. Definitely an easy A.", "THE BEST PROFESSOR YOU WILL EVER HAVE IN EVERY WAY!!!! JUST DO ALL ASSIGNMENTS AND STUDY THE NOTES HE GIVES YOU FOR HIS MULTIPLE TESTS AND YOU WILL GET AN A.", "Dibble is the funniest guy i know..lol. Its a easy A class, and he makes it interesting. Sometimes he is hard to understand, but really all you have to do is show up to get an A in his class.. He pisses off many people which makes class funnier..lol", "He is very knowledgeable and explains the material well, but his lecture can seem never-ending and his homework problems are a lot harder than the ones he goes over in class. They are also very long (some with 40 questions) but he gives you normally over a week to complete. I would suggest taking MWF to have shorter lectures or else you'll zone out", "I am not sure this is the right class for Mr. Martin to teach. I felt that most of the class was confused on the overall subject. He DID give his all and was very nice and definitely knew the information,just teaching us the information was not clear enough. That may be because of a student who kept disrupting the class.", "Printing out his lecture slides will get you no where. live, eat, and breath the textbook. Try looking up orgo guides books outside of class, they can explain things more simply than Kelly and the textbook. Be careful, there is no lab to help your grade in orgo2 like in orgo1. Good Luck!", "Good professor. Interesting and helpful. He does go off on tangents though, but his stories are good.", "As long as you do everything on Blackboard, show up for class (he gives points for you being there!), and just study, you'll do juuuust fine! He's willing to help and there are always open labs for you to go to. Take advantage of those! He's great!", "Awesome teacher... makes class fun... easy to talk to and very carring!!! Come Back!!!!", "GREAT professor! Loves to teach. Classes are a lot of fun. His spring flora class was one of the most memorable classes I ever took, even though it was pretty hard (But what else do you expect from an upper level course). I would definitely recommend him!", "HE IS A GREAT TEACHER I LOVE HIM........", "Decent enough for undergrad courses but an absolute nightmare for graduate work. Will constantly blame you for stuff he demanded in his revisions. Very unorganized, doesn't have much knowledge on the graduate thesis process. I have sincerely regretted choosing him as my advisor. He will try to keep you there as long as possible for funding.", "Very nice prof with a warm, shy smile. I hope he talks louder and clearer. I am not a native English speaker, and have no idea what he talks about 80% of the time. He does try to be funny as I can see my classmates laugh from time to time - but since I don't understand him I don't know what they are laughing about. :P", "He's a nice guy, but his lectures aren't much beyond average. If you have an interest in the subject he can be a really helpful guy, but to the uninitiated his lectures seem a bit dull.", "Mr. Enomoto, is a very nice instructor. He is helpful and he is very easy. What I liked about his class was that he would let you out early to go to the lab to do your homework. If you want an \"A\" you need to take him.", "Explains topics very clearly and seems to be knowledgable about psychology. The class was very interesting.", "He is a really nice guy and is willing to do anything to help you be successful in your college career. The class is an easy A if you do what he asks yu to do and you go to class.", "Prof. Hancock is one of the best professors at Gburg! He's super helpful, his class was interesting and engaging, and he's pretty funny. He makes you read a lot but it's totally worth it. It's obvious that he loves what he teaches and cares about his students. Well the ones that pay attention. Oh! And his 1 page papers are the best!", "Best proff of my university experience. Test can be very easy, if you study the terms he provides, and can link those terms and information in your essays on the test. Also, make sure you know big picture things, i.e. the effects of the New Deal.", "An intellectual and effective teacher. He is very clear in his teaching and he can provide concrete examples while he is at it. Very approachable too. The reading list for this class is massive though. Still, he is a fair marker, when it wasn't the TA who was marking.", "Honestly one of the best classes I took. He divides the semester into three major portions and his exams are only on what the material that was covered previously. He does give a cumulative, but its not a regular cumulative. He lets you decide what you would like to discuss out of the topics that were covered throughout the semester. Best teacher!!", "No Comments", "I guess you either like him, or you don't. He is a bit full of himself, and he is hard to please. He is really serious. All I have to say is have fun with the practical exam.", "lectures can seem a bit out of date and somewhat boring, but he cares about his students and he really tries to make it easy for everyone. Class attendance and the oral presentation are gifts from him to you. Easiest 20% of the grade. Just show up! Goes over everything that will be in exams! class paper is easy, just follow the outline. no hmwrk", "He's a Silver Fox with a side of Awesome Sauce! He has a gazillion lines of Shakespeare memorized so every class starts with a performance, sometimes with props and costumes. Really cool and really fun. And you'll learn tons. Just don't let him catch you staring at his eyes or his hair or his everything. You'll blush and it will be awkward.", "I agree his tests are totally harder than what he teaches in class and the homework he gives us.", "well i must say scanlin is a nice guy. his awesome haircut & wonderful ways with words kept me entertained allll semester long. :)", "Fantastic professor - probably the best I've ever had. Very informative and entertaining. Lots to read and lots of notes to take, but if you do your part he will do his. He no longer teaches SOC131 as he's moving to the Crim Jus side of campus, but if you have the chance to take a class of his you won't regret it.", "Energetic and fast-paced. Good if you can keep up. Good luck if you can't.", "Horrible Horrible Horrible, never take his class!! He is such a mean guy, and loves to make students lives bad, also he takes it out on the whole class if students miss or walk out. I know it is rude to walk out, but I dont blame the students who did with this guy.", "He is not very clear when giving assignments and he doesn't have good people skills at all. Seems very nervous when teaching and treats students like little kids. Not good with controlling the classroom , do not take course", "Knows what he's talking about, has trouble teaching it. Very unorganized. Lazy; most assignments and tests are cobbled together from old ones. Course notes and PowerPoint slides don't match up and sometimes outright conflict. Makes mistakes when solving examples but doesn't catch them.", "He is alrite, but since I was not interested at all in the subject material I was generally bored. Tests have a lot of multiple choice questions and short answer questions, so it is not just solving problems.", "knows his stuff on typography", "The only reason why this teacher is still around is because he is married to the dean. He told us we wouldn't have a final exam, then he slaps us with a 12-pg final paper and a final exam that covered over 2,000 pages of reading. The class was ridiculously boring to the point of being hilarious. Seems like an easy A, but it WASN'T. The class SUCKS!", "He thinks you need to teach yourself. There were many times a student would ask a question and Dr. Fern would answer then later send an email saying he was wrong about the answer. About 2/3 of the class has a C or lower. I hated him as a teacher. I am going to change colleges because of him because I am an accounting major.", "had him for forensic psych class, absolutely worst professor EVER!!! do urself a favor and do not waste time signing up 4 his class his exams r ridiculous and so are his teaching skills. he sux ass and needs to get another hobby", "Class is very stressfull! Luckily he curves his grading scale and I somehow managed a B-. Too often the questions on the exams were nowhere in the book or notes we took. I would stray away from this professor if possible.", "Wouldnt retake this class with him. Hes good at teachin but for some reason some of the concepts were presented too difficult to remember throughout the course. He does allow cheat sheets for exams but make them quick to understand b. c it can slow you down. Make sure cheat sheets have examples of steps for specific problems rather than definitions", "Great teacher. Easy class, usefull info...rock on McMahan", "WORST TEACHER EVER!!! he doenst want to help anyone and he gets mad when you ask him to explain a problem. he doesnt know what he is doing and messes up on example problems! drop him now!", "He is one of the most arrogant individuals I've ever met. Has zero people skills and won't admit when he's wrong. If he realizes that he's wrong he'll just rip on you to deflect attention from himself.", "I think Bob Vandergrift is good guy. His lectures went off track quite a bit. He is unclear at times, and is extremely mean if you are late to class even on minute, you might as well not even come if your 1 min late. He enjoys what he teaches but I recommend going to another instructor..", "No Comments", "I learned a lot from this course. Definitely the best I've taken at U of A.", "Absolutely amazing. Take him if you can. His class is mostly online & meets about once a week. During class he more so gives life lessons & speaks from experience. He doesn't want anyone to fail. I've never had a prof who cares so much about their student's well-being. 3 online tests, online final, weekly discussions, & a few papers, that's it!", "Tim is very passionate about whatever class he is teaching, but if you are not diggin' the class then it gets annoying and old fast. Pretty easy grader, quizzes every week, three paper and a final. Way too much reading at way too fast of a pace.", "The class is very boring at times when there is no class discussion taking place. He will go out of his way to help you out when you need it and it helps that he even has a sense of humor!", "Dr. Spivey really cares about his students. He has talked to me many times in his office about personal life stuff and class stuff. He is very smart in his field of study. His examples he uses in class fit perfectly with the material we cover.", "Simply put, Dr. Arrigo is the man. Common sense in a sea of lunacy; intelligence in a world of stupidity and someone not afraid to think outside the box instead of grazing with the sheep. Every graduate class should be like his. Don't read or lecture grad students... get them to THINK FOR THEMSELVES. Dr. Arrigo \"gets it.\"", "You have to understand three things: 1. Do NOT skip ANY of his classes, he knows. 2. Do ALL the assigned work. 3. When you think he hates you, he doesn't - he just wants you to do well. His class is like a non-stopping train from the first minute until the last. You HAVE to be focused. Show him you CARE about your future and you will do fine.", "took both of his gangs classes. would love to take more. he's funny, easy, love his classes. must take this professor.", "Rick is an amazing teacher. He is not your typical community college teacher, he is highly educated and so passionate. His lectures are interesting and probative every single day. He is technologically savvy and utilizes many internet resources during lecture. This is my second class with him and I have never been bored during a single lecture.", "The class was mostly discussion and lecture based. The topics were fairly interesting, and he made handouts of all the information we needed to know. Quiz and exam questions come straight from his handouts. He's not a very tough grader, and he's not the most interesting professor either, but the class was very easy.", "I actually liked him until the end of quarter. He didn't post the grades for any extra credits and even the final, therefore I had no clue of how I got a grade lower than what I expected. When I asked him politely about that after the quarter ended, he was being very careless at answering my questions. I will never in my life take his class again.", "Awesome teacher and he's cute too!", "Steve was the first actual guitar teacher i ever had. He has lots of patience and is very helpful. Will somebody please put a red chili under his name already! He is the best!", "Best professor I ever had- nearly convinced me to change my major to Sociology. He made a couple of the most difficult classes I had also the most enjoyable. Arrogant? Yes. Charming? Yes. Inspirational? That too. Probably would have inspired me to like Algebra, too, if he had taught it.", "Yeah as we all know chem 102 is really hard. I have gotten A's in my O chem classes but Dr Berg is just purely an incompetent professor. If anybody who knew how to read english and write english with the help of periodic table thats him. Doesnt know a thing about teaching. His exams are from the VOO DOO land.Save urself..and run from him", "you rock bob!", "He was a great professor. He definitely knows what he's doing. Like everyone else says, he can be harsh but its definitely well deserved. If you do what you're supposed to and just make an attempt to participate you'll find that you have no problems with him. Overall, his class is extremely amusing and he may just be my favorite professor.", "Very tough grader! A very goof professor though! Explains everything very clear. You MUST study every night to pass his tests. His tests might not seem too hard but trust me they are very difficult! Would recommend him to anyone but you must be willing to dedicate A LOT of time to this class.", "Amazing man!!! Anyone who has been out of school a while should take him. And he is very pleasing on the eyes:)", "He's okay. He gives you many opportunities to raise your grade. If you do your work, you will probably do fine.", "alright prof, he speaks softly so sit closer to him. pretty boring but his exam is fair. i did alright on his section, he gets 30 questions (15 x 2 weeks teaching). i read textbook for his section as his notes arent fantastic", "Awesome teacher. He's the type of teacher you will remember for the rest of your life.", "favorite professor ever! only one final paper, and then exams (easy) class was intersting and he always had people laughing. mouth like a truck driver sometimes, doesnt hold back. doesnt teach by the book, never had to open it once during the semester either. had him for criminology and juvenile justice. take him for every class that you can!", "Hyde is a really cool guy and always has interesting stories to share. He is super smart and intellectual to the point where it's kind of intimidating. Some of the time when people raised their hands he would kind of shut down their ideas but for the most part he is really nice. Super easy homework. He takes attendance once a week.", "just tell him what he wants to hear - he is not interested in your opinion. He teaches same films over and over: China Town, Reel 7, some film on cinematography, Sweet Hereafter and Eyes Wide Shut. He will toot his own horn a lot, since he EDITED the script for Sweet Hereafter. Fair marker, didnt get a lot out of his classes.", "A fantastic professor. I wasn't looking forward to SOC theory at all and with Dr. G it quickly became my favorite class of the semester. He is passionate Sociology and wants to see his students succeed. He treats you like adults and gives it to you straight. Great guy. Would take him again and recommend him without a doubt.", "Prof. Harding is an amazing professor. The content of the class was pretty tough and he did an amazing job teaching it to us. Be prepared to read and write, there were about 6 novels we had to read for this course. Show up and show him that you care and you will be fine.", "Welcome to college! Because in this class, You MUST read the textbook, you have to write 4 papers. He doesn't give out a study guide. He says \"the lecture is on one wavelength, the textbook is on another, and the tests cover both wavelengths\". You MUST study before the tests. I'll be surprised if I pass the class.", "He is really nice professor that I have ever seen. He helps me a lot!!!! I wanna take his class again:)", "Took 5 classes from him: -1st year Weather/Climate, people piss around and then get mad when they fail; you have to show up, and you have to pay attention. THe notes are all there, but people on't use them! His 2, 3 and 4th year classes are amazing. Glacial geomorphology, river mechanics, and N.American Weather Systems are all fantastic classes.", "No Comments", "Drop this class immediately. Absolutely will not teach anything that is not needed for the assignments. Flat out said he wouldn't answer my question about something in the textbook because we wouldn't need it for any assignments. You are better off buying the book and using stackoverflow for your questions.", "No Comments", "i was nervous because many reviews i read said the course gets difficult. i didn't find that it was difficult at all, and i'm not really a student that keeps up with work. i never even opened my textbook and i always left class 15-30 minutes early for my next one across campus. you can tell he enjoys the topic and care about his students", "THIS PROFESSOR IS TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. THIS PROFESSOR GIVES 3 EXAMS WHICH ARE MULTIPLE CHOICE BUT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. EXTREMELY. IT GETS BETTER THOUGH... THE FINAL IS 100 MC QUESTIONS WHICH IS CUMULATIVE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER. SAVE YOUR GPA, TAKE THIS WITH SOMEONE ELSE!!!", "Dr. K is a pretty funny guy and he's very reasonable on assignments and grading. He really likes his upper division students and even brought us pizza. Easy B, but an A will require just a little effort.", "What a jerk! How did he get his degree? Where is it from, Wal-Mart? This man is a FOOL!!!", "Great teacher, very enthusiastic, and genuinely cares about his students. Great guy. One of my favorite teachers I've had.", "I love Greggy D!", "Bruce was wonderful. Not only did he teach me tons about meditation, stress management and prevention, he offered a wealth of other knowledge as well.", "No Comments", "Take him he's an amazing teacher. I got an A and did moderate work. You also learn a lot from him. Like others said he is funny too and has a good personality.", "all his classes were cool...yeah he is a little dry...but he is very passionate about christ & you see it through his teaching...stop hatin' youngstas", "Loparo is easily one of the best professors at Case. His lectures are crystal clear, even when the material gets complicated. Tests are very difficult, but he does curve. Go to every class, it's worth it. Bonus for attending pre-holiday lectures.", "I had him last year. He wasn't my favorite for sure. I find his class boring. He was mostly absent.In his class I was confused to want he talking about although I did read the book.For me he lack a lot to be a professor. But that's my opinion.", "MEAN MAN, the worst at U.O., changed my major at UO", "Very caring professor and class is usually a debate. Be careful though if your views differ from the majority and especially his. If you think differently be careful with your arguments; he is very sensitive and doesn't appreciate a true discussion/ debate, especially if you are very strong and on the opposite side of his views/ beliefs.", "Dr. Snider is one of the best professor's I have ever taken. Yes, he is a tough grader, but he made me a better student. If you do not like online homework/quizzes, DO NOT take him. Very caring, entertaining, and helpful.", "SALVO IS THE BEST!!", "Easy class if you review lectures for exams(every other week), and word/excel tests are easy if you just practice online. Attendance wise, you just need 70% to have 100% and that is tracked by iClicker participation every lecture, so you can miss a few classes because the powerpoints are all posted online. Great teacher, easy class", "This guy is the most boring teacher. Use BLACKBOARD there is a reason it used at seneca. If you can't teach and damn your class is so boring then atleast put up powerpoints so we can learn on our own. Always talking about his life so hard to learn from this guy choose another teacher now before its too late.", "Nice guy, easy going.", "He's a tough grader, will call on everyone for answers, and expects you to act and think scholarly. What's wrong with that, though? You're in college and that too a senior college and not community college. If you can't handle basic studying then real life's got surprises for you. Be ready to work but also be ready to learn.", "Very good teacher! If you want to learn math, then look no farther! He was a Steelers' fan so we got alone. But serious very good teacher, teaches the bigger picture in math. Exams and quizzes can be tricky tho. I would recommend him for any math class if you really want to learn the material!", "Scripps isn't a easy teacher. He can be funny and is a genius when it comes to coding, but he doesn't really do a good job teaching it to you. he isn't much help in labs at all either. It's hard at first because I had no programming or coding experience. I learned everything just fine, but mostley by myself with my text book. he's a funny guy tho.", "The whole class was taught off the internet. Count on this guy to bore you to death AND! give you papers that will take you days. The only sources for your papers are primary documents which were written hundreds of years ago and are hard to understand.", "I loved him. He requires 95% for an A, but that's because his teaching style makes it so possible. No curve. He has 8 short quizzes (sometimes in groups) rather than large tests, a few short homeworks per week, and iClicker questions in class that are participation-based. Does everything he knows how in order to help his students truly learn.", "Too many kids drop his class to say he's doing it right. If so many kids fail a test, something is wrong, cause its not bc they don't try.", "He was a really good teacher he helps me to be a better student", "class is hard, but he teaches valuable info, worked hard to get a B but feel better about my writing skills", "All he needs to do is show up on time and he's one of the best professors around. Has lots of experiance, minimal effort required for an A in his classes.", "This was one of the best classes I've ever taken. Ian was very knowledgeable. The material that I learned could one day save my life. I think Ian is great teacher and I can't wait to take other classes with his school, Live Safe Academy.", "Hes a very funny teacher. Very humerous. But hes a great teacher. He gets to the point and as long as you pay attention easy A. He does help you out some but you have to attend class. If you miss to many days you will be dropped out.", "Gerry's a little strange (he barked at us the first day..) but a really good teacher and he is very good at explaining concepts in ways that American students will understand. Oral exams are really hard and you're expected to know a lot of vocab, but the chapter tests are really simple. Just do the hw and be prepared for class and you will do fine.", "I didn't like this class, so the he wasn't my favorite teacher. but i heard he was ok for other classes", "This class was very interesting and definately unforgettable. I really hate plants, but he makes it fun and the field trips make class go by pretty fast.", "No Comments", "Hard course, good basics - study", "I wanted to take Foster but ended up taking Sierra. He is VERY rude. He talks SO fast during his lectures making it difficult to keep up & write down everything u need. He asks the stupidest smallest details about a movie or person on the test.

Dr.Tompkins is a Talented Professor with unique teaching style. Starting from our class, he started providing audio powerpoint presentations which turned out to be very helpful. Tests are very challenging, so pay attention to everything he says. Grade consists of a Midterm, Final or Group project and five quizzes.", "Ok so I am not a math person, but Mr. Aldridge does a fantastic job demystifying mathmatics and is very clear about the subject. Highly reccomended", "Took him Fall 2002 for Creative Writing in Poetry. Made us spend $40 to buy TWO of his poetry books that we opened only ONE of ONCE. He has a very pompous attitude. Takes roll and calls you out if you're not there. DON'T bring food to class!!!", "Very helpful if you have questions.", "Well, intitially he seemed intelligent and methodical but quickly it changed. With his constant boasting about his IQ and his presitgious status he rarely was able to find time to speak about philosophy. I felt the purpose of the class was to belittle the students and to glorify his self. I strongly recommend not taking any class he teaches!", "Just keep up with your work and you will be fine", "Great lectures and articulates the concepts very well. Course materials are very well organized. He provides slides that are fill-in-the-blank so you pay attention, and it's not hard to with this teacher. He also records his lectures along with the slides which is a big bonus.", "A little rude but if you show up to class you'll be fine ohhhh just don't be late.", "Great professor, super nice. He is the type of professor who cares more about student's learning than grade, and actually means it. He is a super caring guy and really wants to help students. He has many great life stories to share and will not fail you as long as you show up and be respectful, and try. Easy class, and teaches a lot!", "Funny that I'm rating a professor when I haven't had him for a class for a few years - but he is definitely one of the best.", "Man can he talk! I would often find myself zoning out. He mostly just reads directly from the book for the entire class period without showing any visuals or anything interesting. One redeeming quality is that he is extremely funny, and injects his humor throughout. Your entire grade is dependent on the two tests: midterm and final grades.", "This professor does a very good job of writing examples on the board...mind that hes always standing in front of them, ...and writes them at lightning speed. be warned. professor gives no theory or background on subject. He never shows up to the lab, but can be found durring office hours. This was the most infuriating class that I ever took.", "Steve was not very helpful, the tests feel more like guessing games as they cover material we have not learnt in class. Worst teacher in the Business school.", "I deserved an A in this class. I was the only person who participated on a consistent basis and even corrected professor at times. He gives out participation points 3 times randomly. He gave me a B because I missed one of those days. I got an A on my work yet I got a B in the class. He royally screwed me over, I should have a person above him.", "his black humor sometimes just really funny, and his lecture sounds easy, but the exam is not easy at all. have to read really hard to get good grade in that class.", "one of the best professors i had at highline! so good at what he does, one of those classes you will remember for a lifetime.", "he offered me absolutely no help in the class. i learned less from him than from any teacher i have ever taken. I DO NOT RECOMMEND HIM !!!", "Do not take this class if you just want to learn regular guitar, not just nylon string. This class is classical style only. You need to take 83A instead, there you can play acoustic or nylon string and you'll cover several styles. In Jones class, you have to play exactly how he tells you, so if you can't change your playing way, you won't be happy.", "No Comments", "If you're just trying to get units for your general ed, this is not for you. Quizzes are given almost every class session and he is a very hard grader on essays. He'll give you 8 essay questions to study before the exam, pick four of the essay questions, and then you only answer you. You basically waste your time studying 6 extra essay questions.", "He is a very encouraging professor. He is both serious and humorous about the course. He explained things clearly to make sure all understood.", "Really cares about his students and makes sure you know all the time that he is willing to listen during the class and after the semester is over. He says he won't hold attendance against you if it's 2 or less classes, but he does. Class is work heavy at the end, just reading through the whole class and then all the assignments are due at end", "Avoid! He's is arrogant. ACS test scores are national. We do terrible on it here at UVU. Take Chem - both semesters - at BYU or the U in the summer. Not with him. Not with him. Not with him.", "If you're a student who is horrible at taking exams or actually have a life and have to work in order to pay for college, do not take any course with Professor Kurylo.

If you struggle with math, he is the guy to take. He explains things well & it really helps. Unfortunately he wont be teaching stat or else I would taking him again....

He's clearly intelligent and engaged, and he makes a potentially boring subject (Contracts) interesting. Plus, he's warm and generous to his students. One of the best professors I've had in my many years of being a student.", "He does not do a very good job of actually instructing. If you can't meet with him during his \"How to schedule \"face-to-face\" meeting\" hours then you're screwed as far as learning more. Good luck actually learning how to do anything from him.", "I loved Craig's class. He's such a nice teacher and you can really learn a lot if you pay attention. Plus the outdoor days where great!", "There are assignments every week, which although is a lot, only 240 of 310 possible points actually counts which leaves out 2-3 assignments. You only lose BONUS marks from him if you ask questions from a lecture 2 weeks ago. There are many practice quizzes at the DGDs to help you. He's a great prof and wants to help, but it's a difficult course.", "Test was pretty easy.Go everyday bc he takes attendance randomly and gives you extra credit. The class before the test he gives you a review..write these things down, they're pretty much word for word from the exam.For the paper, go to him and get your article cleared in advance and you will be ok", "can not learn a lot from his class, no efficient, no quiz, you never know your homework is right or not. but pass might not difficult. high grade is not easy.", "Truley one of the best if not the best professor I've ever had.

I recommend him to everyone.", "awesome teacher awesome guy if you get the chance take him for any class even if its not a CRJ", "Lectures a lot, but he knows what he's talking about. Classes were fun, and he's an extremely fair grader. No tests, but expect to write several papers. Not too hard though, I'd reccomend it to anyone. Great professor.", "Awesome guy, funny, fun class, never used the textbook and it was expensive, 3 exams", "IF you want a teacher who is polite and respectful to others, then professor Brown is NOT the teacher for you. Take his class if you want a professor who acts too PUNK ROCK for the whole world, talks to the ladies, believes he is god and we are all his servents, and is a total geek... then take him!", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Use the workbook to get help on the exercises. Write down anything that he puts on the screen. You can get a B if you ask questions and stay awake.", "One of the best Acting classes I've taken. Jim really makes you think outside the box and will always take the time to help you out in a pinch. The class has no real homework except for two partner scenes and one monologue. Overall a great class.", "Went on personal rants all the time, and didn't really teach us much about the material. Extremely hard to get a hold of, and the grading was a constant mess. I will avoid him in the future.", "Great professor! Be prepared to do the work but the work is easy if you apply yourself. Deadlines matter but he gives enough time to complete it. Assignments are based on current events so it easily keeps interest!", "Nicest sweetest man. A's to ALL students!!", "This was the hardest most stressful class I have ever had.", "AWESOME PROF!! Class is difficult, but he is so willing to help out!! He has a lot of respect for the students, as long as you do the work. One of my fave profs on campus.", "He does know he stuff however when you think you have the hang of it he makes it confusing. He tests are very detail and often difficult. Not an easy class at all. He is nice and tries to help but his test are what kills your grade.", "An awesome teacher that really cares about you and your grade. He is very clear with what is on the exam, he even lets you drop an exam. Gives out fair amount of extra credit so getting a good grade in his class isn't too difficult", "Not a good teacher. He definitely tried though.", "Best class I've taken at Highline. I got to know everybody b/c he made us memorize everyone's name to do class discussions. Gives MANY extra cred, so be sure to do them all. Might seem like 1pt doesn't matter but trust me, it adds up. Returns tests next day b/c he believes you should get feedback asap. Read book & study. Take Dr. Bob! No regrets!", "very unclear, long rambling lectures very self-centered man, lectures were 50% about himself and 50% about the material test questions had some surprises, content that you can be sure was never covered in class he is sadly nearly tenured", "I believe this was the easiest class I took at MCP. Sure, his material is challenging, but gives what, 30 bonus points on each exam? Come on, I had like 110 average going into each final... Those who complain are just sick of having their drinking time cut into. Just wait till you get to biochem/Pcol...", "Definitely a great professor. I'd graduated 10 years ago and still remember Mr. James Muckell as one of the best people I've ever met. He made everyone feel as their family, in fact he was like a dad to me. Those who try to tarnish his name should be ashamed. I'll pray for you guys.", "Really super guy, great personality and made boring stuff really meaningful. Puts up with too much crap from noisy, disrespectful students, needs to crack the whip more on the idiots.", "By far the BEST professor I have ever had at Fordham. This review mirrors the others, but I will reiterate. The workload is INTENSE so be prepared for multiple assignments due within days of each other. Midterm and final are extremely difficult, however he is a phenomenal professor and I learned so much from him. He knows his stuff. Take him!", "Complete JERK! I do NOT suggest taking this class by any means. He is unclear, boring, and incredibly pompous. He thinks that just because he is old and graduated from Harvard he is intelligent. HE IS NOT!", "omg. what can i say? horrible teacher. its bad enough that he doesn't know how to teach, but when he does teach... he's WRONG. also, what he calls \"cutting edge\", \"new\", and \"revolutionary\" has been around for um.. years. good job jkeating! keep wasting our precious money. *sigh* I was looking forward to an e-commerce class.", "The problem with BC students is that they DON'T STUDY!! McMahan is great!! He doesn't give surprises on exams as other professors do. Attend lecture, read the text (read to understand, not memorize), and you'll be fine. We do read the entire book.. but as long as you keep up, there shouldn't be any problems. I highly recommend him.", "2nd time taking him, easy A and if you want to learn then you will. take him, tons of extra credit and not a whole lot of work.", "Terrible instructor....", "Extremely difficult professor for a general education course requirement. Gives WAY TOO MANY readings and does not understand that we have other classes and majors. His exams are too tricky. Do NOT take him if you want an A.", "Just graduated from Oakland in May. Dr. Rorke is an amazing professor! He makes learning fun and inspires students. He is straight to the point and is serious about his students education. Enjoyed every class that I took that Dr Rorke taught.", "As previously stated, he is very intelligent, and challenges ppl intellectually. However, because he is so intelligent, he makes things more complex than they have to be. I do recommend him if you are into thinking and intellecutal growth. If you are just up to getting easy A's, then avoid him at all costs.", "Professor Burge absolutely knows his stuff. He is passionate about child development and mentions his grandson and basketball team every class. Only take 1 exam and the final. 1 or 2 BB assignments and 3 observations of kids under 18. I would definitely take him again.", "EXCELLENT PROFESSOR!!!!! ONLINE CLASS EASY A. WISH HE TAUGHT MORE CLASSES ONLINE.", "Egotistical!", "Dr. Velleman - and though I took his class nearly 22 years ago - provides a good structural framework for how to approach statistical analysis in general. It helps develop a sense of how it should be done. Listen to this brilliant man. It will do you good.

He's a great, funny guy, but this class was difficult and I went to every class and hardcore studied. The course guidebook helps IMMENSELY- it has study guides in it, but tests are still difficult. Make sure you read the books he assigns. The grading scale is SUPER lenient- I got a 75% which is a B.", "This class was too easy. I seriously could have done it in my sleep. If you know the basics of power point, word, excel, and access you will get an A. Just show up, participate and turn in your assignments on time. This class could be hard for anyone with very limited computer skills, but for most it will be the easiest class of their academic path", "He's evil, very inappropriate", "Great take him if you can take the heat", "he is an amazing professor! very easy! only a few papers are due during the semester, but he has not final exam. I really loved him!! he is funny, only thing bad about him, is he is kinda boring at times.but other then that this class is an easy A", "Bob is the best teacher for math I dont like math but he made it fun and easy to understand. Would definitly recommend taking him. The tests come write out of the textbook. He will stay after class if you need help.", "Dear god, this class is horrible. So sorry you all have to take it as CPSC majors. Tests have random things that he may or may not discuss on them, you only have 5 grading opportunities. Lectures are boring and too fast paced to take notes. Isn't helpful at all if you have a problem.

Doug is eager to help any student though, if confused at all ask for help", "No Comment.", "Craig is my absolute favorite teacher of all time, I have taken zoology and man & environment with him and I am going on his field bio class to Costa Rica this winter. Zoology means a lot of memorizing but he gives a ton of extra credit on the tests and in the class in general so it is easy to do well. Man & environment was the easiest class ever.", "EVERY class is a power point lecture -It was painful! Weekly quizes based on reading, lecture and any newspaper story he felt like. Hard grader too. Most people dropped the class. Not very personable or considerate as a teacher.", "The class material was interesting, and he was always available for help/questions. Extra credit was made available. He's a really nice person and probably one of my favorite professors.", "This teacher is one of the worst teachers i have ever had. He does not help you, and riducles you when you make a mistake, had to drop this class so it would not effect my GPA BTW: this teacher can not grade. The TDA is total BS if you post 10 times and he will tell you the posts are relevant he will still give you a 50 or 60. WORST TEACHER AVOID A", "Good teacher, but hard marker. If you take an online course with her, do not slack off, cause you will get a D or Fail. Do the assignments on time and you will be fine.", "This guy is a quack! You never understand what he is saying!", "His class was okay. I would recommend lots of studying outside of class because his voice is little monotone so makes you sleepy in class.", "This was one of the most confusing classes.

It's so far the only class that talked about real world experiences. He can sometimes be moody but overall i think very dedicated to the students. The workload is a lot for non-emphasis area people.", "dudes a good teacher, lol at las comment...he knows his **** like no other plus hes young and is one of those profs who is actually smarter than the students in his class...good dude", "Be prepared for lots of readings and bad jokes. Brilliant guy, just has terrible lecturing skills and tends to devote whole class periods to unrelated or unhelpful material.", "M'kay?", "If you actually talk to him he is really sweet! If he knows you from talking with you he will help you out, most of the quizzes are group quizzes and he gives you the answers and extra credit! You have to read a lot but a lot is from the lectures. I would definitely recommend!", "No Comments", "Glenn is a helpful professor who doesn't want you to fail. Makeup policies are good. You don't need the textbook but need the SIMnet pass which is pricey. Class is easy as long as you show up with the iClicker. Read his lectures before a test and you're good. Also, do the SIMnet tutorials, very helpful!", "Took this as an ITV course at the main campus. Pretty boring, but map quizzes were easy. Lets you take test online through blackboard. pretty easy. Had him for GEO 201 and he did the same thing.", "Prof Douglass seems to have social awkwardness which everyone seems to define as 'bad'. He seems very particular about his notes and wont defer.

Learned a lot about the law that I didn't know!", "Todd is one of the best profs I've had in 2 years at UVM. He's hilarious, insightful, and really knows his stuff.

Take a class with this man if you have the chance!", "brannon is the best psych teacher - he is clear, passionate, and extremely fair. do not take this class if you are scared of working; there is a ton of notes and readings but it's interesting. psych majors - do not miss out on any of the classes he offers.", "Imagine Ichabod Crane with a nice wardrobe. That's about what Prof. Crozier looks like. In some weird way, it's incredibly charming. And the humane learnedness another reviewer mentioned adds to his appeal. That, and the fact that there are very few people on this planet from whom you can learn more.", "Hes great, I had him a couple of semesters ago and Im upset he doesnt teach there anymore. He only gives 3 tests, essay based but really simple...he even lets you use the book/notes. Hes really funny and a very brilliant man, makes the class interesting.", "Very interesting class and he makes it fun. Reccommend taking the class!", "Awesome director of Chamber Winds!!", "Professor Kent is hands down one of the best professors I've had my college career.

Take anything you can with him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "best professor at this school", "Assignments are a breeze. There are only 3 test and attendance that are part of your grade.

I think it was decent amount of homework. I learned a lot from him. It was a little hard to catch up in his class and the assignments at first but his lecture/feedback always makes sense and logical. He spared a lot of his time every time I asked questions. I would take his class again.", "the worst professor i never ever had.", "No Comments", "Gives everything that will be on the exam in review, but it is still really difficult. He is a generous grader but not generous enough. There is no curve.", "No Comments", "He is a hard grader, but he wants you to know the subject not just memorize it to pass the test.

I wish I had more history credits remaining so I could take him again.", "Tests are near impossible to finish and account for most of grade. Does not grade on a curve.

His lectures are not organized at all so the main idea is usually lost on everyone.\r Avoid him if you can.", "Maybe it was the subject matter (biker gangs), but I really liked this class. My hand still hurts from all the notes, but in the end he decided not to give a test. Most of the videos killed me (and there were a lot of them), but Dr. Barker's comments during them made me wake up occasionally. Entire grade was based on a book review and attendance.", "He makes it clear on the first day what he expects from the class. He grades by how well you do compared to the class. He has a very thick accent and makes jokes about math majors and being from China. You will hear the word \"lousy\" and \"stupid\" everyday. He uses it to describe everything. He goes super fast and you need to study outside of class.", "I was really excited to take this course but it didn't live up to my hopes. The prof is obviously interested in what he's doing but he doesn't succeed in making lectures interesting at all. Those who attend usually sleep.

Tough teacher, but if you like a guy who doesnt put up with any crap..this is your guy!! Those who rated him poorly probably did so because they did poorly in class.", "Not that bad of a prof. A little boring but not too hard.", "This man is a genius. The class itself is extremely hard, and it's not my major or anything (and my first PoliSci class) so I have trouble with it, but he's really good about explaining things if you ask. I thought I'd hate the class just because it's SO hard, but I don't, because Pletcher rocks.", "Brian is a very bad teacher i would not recommend anyone talke his classes if they don't have to. He is very unclear and all over the map with his teaching.", "Horrible professor. Unorganized and thinks he knows everything. He is very boring and is not a fair grader.

Doesn't have class on fridays.", "he's ok", "This professor does not care to help when you reach out to them for help. The tests are timed and are very difficult.

He shares information that is pertinent to creating a professional teacher!", "This class is very interesting, and the professor knows a lot about the period. Be sure to do the reading!", "He's so sweet, I had to study more than for my other classes but I do not regret it at all. Always be present for class, miss more than two classes and you're out- no joke. He will week out the weak ones so if you're looking for an easy professor look else where.", "Phenomenal lecturer. Lectures are two hours, so it takes stamina, but if you engage yourself it is completely worth it. Lectures blew my mind every day and although the readings could be long, I usually enjoyed them.

Well he sure did a great job of helping us understand it in real life by making the class average exponentially lower each time we write the test.", "Simply a wonderful professor.

Take any class you can with him!", "Needs to stick to specific topic more", "Moody. It's hard to rate him because one day he's wonderful (helpful and nice) and the next a total grouch (critical and nasty).

Just show up and make sure he gets to know you his memory isnt the best.", "If you just go to the lecture, take very good notes, and do the study guide, you will pass.

Tests are mainly multiple choice but problem sets are also included.", "Open book, open notes. But still not very east. He wrote the book so if you don't get it in class, and you ask and he just looks at you like you're dumb..you can't figure it out at home cause he WROte the book!

Don't know how to work ecampus will receive incorrect grades and when you email him about it good luck getting a response", "Do not expect to coast through his class. Do not expect him to give you answers. Go to him with problems and he will lead you to solutions. He wont give you the solution, he will lead you to it and leave you to figure out how to drink.

He is brilliant", "Online Class. Read assignments and do work and you should do fine in this class. Not an \"easy\" A, but if you put in the time and do the assignments it is.", "After graduating, I found that his classes are the most useful in the real corporate world. He is very clear and interactive in his teaching methods (with classroom discussions and on-hands experience). His textbooks were actually used, compared to other professors who assign books and never review/test the material. Hes also nice and encouraging.", "Dr. Bosworth cares about his students. He has a good sense of humor. He goes over everything that appears on a test. You must apply yourself by at least reading his notes and looking at old homework and tests posted on his website.", "Not the best teacher. He goes over a lot of the assignments in class and makes it VERY difficult to fail. I failed a midterm and the final and still managed to pass with over a 60. Also, DO THE EXTRA CREDIT, It can take pretty close to 10% off the final exam. Very difficult class if you didn't take high school physics. GO TO CLASS, it's worth it", "Don't do it, his tests are not checked, making some answers wrong that are right. He's hard to understand, thinks he is ALWAYS right. My last year in college and he's by far the worst professor I've had as of yet.", "No Comments", "Amazing professor. Highly intelligent. Will remove anyone's stage fright. Too bad he's leaving Seneca. Great asset Seneca is losing. They should give him the schedule he wants. Seneca making a huge mistake. Best teacher ever.", "this man is truly a nerd among nerds. but he's also a fantastic math teacher. if you like silly math riddles this class is for you. He loves to put tricky questions on the tests and there is a problem of the week which is basically a mathriddle that he wants to share with you. altogether not bad. keep an eye out for tricks and you should be ok", "this guy's a softie -- you'd pretty much have to skip class, not do readings, and not show up to the final to get into trouble.", "No Comments", "Weekly discussion posts that had to be done, had to read the online textbook. TA posts notes on BB that were helpful for the tests. Tests were somewhat easy, answers are all in the textbook or in the lecture ppts.

I found his course to be neither good nor bad, mediocre.", "Took Psychology of Death and Dying with him, and while it seemed to be his specialty, he teaches all psychology classes and based on my experience I'd recommend him for any class. Very little homework, very little reading, but I've honestly learned more from him than all other CCC professors combined. What a cool dude.", "Pretty easy, as long as you keep the notes he gives you, you're set.", "Missed the first assignment because I was moving. Did every assignment thereafter and he had me dropped at midterms for not attending. Does not give clear instructions and he doesn't seem to care at all about the students.

Yes, he will drop the \"I really like what the author did here\" joke 100 times. No, it does not get old.", "I had John Corvino for Contemporary Moral Issues, and it was by far my favorite class taken at Wayne. He is hilarious and makes discussions fun.

Prepare to work and do your reading.", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Really obscure, he is unclear and not a very good teacher- he sort of throws out big words and hopes that they sound intelligent, but secretly he's not very smart. Easy if you like pandering to his desire for run of the mill phrases and simplistic insights. All the books are redundant and similar. Good luck.", "Great professor.Likes to have \"Quiz time\" at the start of most classes.Most hw deals with topics from previous courses.Tests are really fair.He pretty much tells you what each question will be before hand.I would recommend you take him for any and all classes possible.", "Excellent and passionate professor, he is extremely willing to help you out in class. He really inspires you to think and learn in his class.", "Freddy knows how to run a laid back yet thought provoking class.

This class, or any with Kauf for that matter is worth taking, whatever your major is.", "Although I wasn't really interested in the subject matter itself, Arlan is an amazing prof.

I recomend him.", "he's hard. but not impossible. when he tells you to study the past exams that are on reserve ... do yourself a favor and study the past exams. they will help you. i promise.", "The idea of paying for classes is to have something contributed by the prof's lecture. He does not really say anything you cannot read in the well prepared reader and text, so no point of going to class aside from seeing slides. The class size was large so no discussion or questions. He's a reader.", "awesome teacher", "Mr. Glennon does not help his students. I don't know what these two posts below me are talking about. they are trying to trick you to join the class, because their is always so many open seats in his class.

Seems almost obsessed with covering more ground than just the textbook, and is focused on all aspects of Russian, from pronunciation to paragraph structure. Great foreign language professor, definite recommendation.", "I took his online Intro to Statistics class.

Take him if you can - he's great", "This guy is a joke. Sooo BORING!! Useless information.", "Wonderful Professor!!!!", "His grading is based on attendance, 1 oral presentation, 1 midterm with essay, and 1 final w/essay. Essay prompts are given 1 week in advance to prepare for. The oral presentation is based on a single question off of the reading, its really easy. Go to his class, his exams are based on lectures.", "Invokes discussion, and provides useful feedback. My only issue is the amount of reading, and the exams require you to remember specific points from all readings. TA's do the grading so be sure to ask them what they look for!

He also curves tests/quizzes slightly.", "Fantastic teacher, obviously passionate about the subject, and passionate about teaching. He is very good at making complex information easily digestible.

Bonus: his personality is unique and fun.", "Started playing guitar when he was 4 yrs old! He's amazing.", "So sexy it's hard to learn, but you might pick up a thing or two as he is so full of information.", "Not very open to alternate interpretation.

Fun class learn a lot but very easy just come to class. And dont buy a book!", "Test was easy but there's lot to learn though and he seems to do all he can to make learning hard.

He also happens to know many of the prominent American photographers from the last 50 years.", "great instructor. big on class participation. do the reading and take good notes on what he says, not just what is on the board. Some greek language needed to retain but not much. BE THICK SKINNED because he can make you feel small but know that everyone there is exactly the same.", "Horrible Instructor! Wish I had looked him up before taking his class. Change to another instructor immediately. Deducts points like it's going out of style. Fully functioning solutions with documentation deducted points for unclear technicalities.", "Professor Warwick, is wonderful he grades fairly and he doesn't round your grade at all so don't expect a higher grade.

I would recommend him to anyone.", "wayy cool. Funny if you actually listen to what he has to say. actually knows what hes talking about. easy A if you attend class. just sit in the front so you can hear him. I recommend", "Very funny. Other people have said it, I'll say it too: Keep an open mind. If you like to argue, you better come VERY prepared!

Lectures online, doesn't take attendance, but go to recitations because they do help with understanding some of the more complex articles!", "Has a true passion for Canadian Literature, and is one of the best professors to study under if you wish to learn more in that field.

Definitely recommend.", "No Comments", "Dr. G does an excellent job of making students feel validated and important to lectures.

Great use of examples and doesn't ask you for too much. You get out what you put into this class.", "I took this professor for a maymester and he was incredibly nice and made what could be a boring class interesting.

There are 3 exams(no extra credit Attendance doesn't matter) On the first day of class he said an A=86-100, B=76-85,C=60-75,D=45-59 and anything below is an F. In the past most students got Ds or Fs. I hope he was joking.", "Preston is a great prof! He made American politics and history so great! I would recommend ANY of his classes", "Personally,I didn't like his teaching style.I hate sitting in circles and having discussions, especially when the people are all super against corporations and they get into these big tyrades about how bad they are.There was too much focus on that,and it got to be quite annoying. Should have dropped", "Attendance is mandatory, lectures are very boring. Spends 20-30 mins talking about current events at the beginning of each class.

He speaks perfectly clearly. I got an A in the class and felt so good because of it. Apparently, it's not an easy class.

They are fair.", "I took him for 2 semesters of Hebrew and he was one of the greatest professors I ever had.", "This class would be absolutely fantastic if it was smaller. 200+ people in a class with an overwhelming amount of theories and case studies doesn't accomplish much.

The best professor I have ever taken , including graduate school", "Avoid him. He's fun to listen to and he knows his stuff but his grading is ridiculous. I completely agree with the reviews below: Make friends with him or forget your A. Switching section for him was the worst move of my final year at JMSB.", "Honestly I need sometime to understand what he said because he got pretty strong accent but it ain't a problem to listen later on. Most of the test are MC and even Final. The questions are straight forward. What u need to do is just keep up with his homework(even though he did not really check it...lol) then u would not have any problem in class:)", "Never noticed him goad or insult anyone. Very kind.

On my final I thought I did really good but he marked me down, and till this day I don't know why!", "He typically has 2 tests, the first test is literally over 1 book adn the 2nd test over a 2nd book. He does let you use a study guide with the test but in a 90 min class the test would have 100 questions, meaning if you had to think about a question for more than 45 seconds you had to turn your test in incomplete. Hated this teacher", "He reminds me of Dr. House. Expert in his field and very knowledgeable and engaging in class. Difficult for me, though, to figure out what he wants on some assignments (I've gotten everything from a B- to an A+, so I'm a bit confused because I don't feel like I did anything different,) but he's a good professor.

Didnt give grades on homework - just credit/no credit which was a nice change.", "I have taken classes with him before, but not online and loved it. His on-line course is disorganized and extremely difficult to follow. Took class in the fall and he still had the schedule up for spring. Lack of communication and very difficult to contact.", "for a 2000 level class, this was brutal. His powerpoints are just endless slides of paragraphs that make no freaking sense. The exams are all essays or terms, which he doesn't even list off, so you basically have rummage through all of the slides and GUESS what may or may not be on the exam. Worst class I've ever taken. Harvey's a nice guy tho", "10 Week Summer Study Abroad class in Chiang Mai, Thailand. NOT an Easy Class, but A+ was doable by completing the reading and finishing the 3 required weekly blogs and 5 hours of community service. One of the best experiences of my life.

The people who commented bad stuff about him are probably idiots who don't know how to pay attention for more than 5 minutes. Really good guy, not a hard class.", "Aldridge is as well my all time favorite teacher. Key words: predictable, un-flaky, cheerful, helpful, REAL. This prof makes me fear using another teacher for my math courses. He not only knows how to teach, but he runs an understandable ship. There are NO surprises, and the fact that he will go above the call of duty to help is evident. DA MAN! ;)", "I went in with a tiny bit of programming experience, and have not found the class to be all that difficult. Scripps was an overall average teacher in my opinion. Very funny though!", "Take this class if you have really good vision cause he writes in like 10 font on the board, and if you like sleeping. Because that's what you'll be doing in this class.

He marked me wrong for a question that everyone knows I got right, he just doesn't understand the meanings of some words.", "One of the best math professors someone could hope for. I had him for Bus Calc, and he was wonderful. He was always available to help, even outside of his official office hours. He really appreciates if you show that you're trying.

Great prof, cares about students, funny, genius.", "He was boring to an extreme. Not to say he did not know his stuff, because he did. However, he tells you everything. Details you do not need to know or care to. He speaks slowly and tends to repeat nouns instead of ever using pronouns. Was just slow and boring. NOT RECOMMENDED", "OMG, his classes are SO not hard. Just do the reading, people, and take notes, then memorize his defs, the pts. of certain concepts, etc. He doesn't like slacker students so don't take him if you don't give a sh*t.", "This has got to be by far the worse professor ever. His teaching style seriously is the worse I've ever seen. He is not helpful, yes he may be knowledgeable but he will not help you if you need it. My gpa is a 3.88 and I work very hard, he makes it seem like this is his only class us students are taking. Believe me he is being reported!", "Great Teacher. He will help you outside of class. Take him if you can.", "Very entertaining. Work/reading load was a bear. When I used cliff notes my grades were A's and when I didn't I got B's.", "Prof. Barden is hands down one of the most amazing professors I have ever had. His class is interesting and humorous and the exams are very fair! His lab is also very interesting and the most fun lab I have ever had! This class hands down was my favorite class at MCPHS so far. He is a very fair grader and is ALWAYS willing to help his students!", "Literally the worst teacher I've ever had! Do not take his class!!!! The average on every test was below a 65 percent. I studied everyday for at least 2 hours. The tests aren't relevant to anything you learn in class. He doesn't teach you anything. I ended up with a 79.82 percent in the class and he wouldn't round up to a B- for me.", "jerry is the man, definitely my favorite math teacher i've had at wwu", "Organizational class was amazing.", "Dr. Bell can come off as a difficult professor. However, if you express interest in the class and attempt to participate in group discussions, you should be fine. Def. go talk to him in his office and don't be afraid to ask for help. He also gives you extra-credit and rewrites on big papers which is fair compensation for the demanding work.", "very very very nice man. VERY boring class,him being so laid back didnt help much. if yu arent interested it gets boring. tests..um theyre ok. i didnt open a book. never paid attention in class. and passed with a B.idk if i wuld recommend. but hes very nice and is willing to help", "Dr.O is the greatest Professor ever. I am honestly depressed that the semester is over. You will learn so much from him and there is never a dull moment in class. Lots of fun and always keeps your attention. I recommend him for any class you can take him with. Sweetest man too!", "I was always treated as an insider even though I wasn't a music major...I still get hugs when I go back after 10 years!!!", "Really open to student's ideas, even when he didn't agree with them he accepted their merit. Really funny and used real world connections to make class interesting.", "He's really fun to have a class with, but the homework in Proof Techniques is extremely difficult! It balances out in the end. If you enjoy a challenge, and you already have a firm grasp on calculus, take his classes.", "Absolute worst professor any one in college could ever take. He does absolutely nothing to help the students. Half of what he \"teaches\" had nothing to do with the class. I actually tried to go in to his office hours to ask for help, but after one question he smiled, laughed, and turned his back on me. Overall he's rude and the most useless profesor", "if its not Greek its not that important. hey can you guys see this slide? oh forget it it doesn't matter (asian arch.) spends 10-15 fixing lighting in order to show greek arch. quote: \"these people blah blah.. This is grotesque\" very closed minded inconsiderate.but he may be a good design professor.", "No Comments", "What a useless man, worst classes ever. Very dry lecture, test are impossible plus you have to deal with his snide little comments when you recieve assignments back. Avoid his classes at all costs", "I thought he was weird at first, but i grew to love his weirdness. I love his sarcasm. I only pay attention to catch the few sarcastic jokes he throws out. Good guy. Teaches clearly. He also makes funny faces without noticing. He's super interesting haha", "Prepare to do a lot of outside study to learn anything in this class. All lectures are just PowerPoint slides and frequently have mistakes in them. He takes off points on HW & tests for things like not showing work on basic math and not using the exact format he uses on formulas. He also has a hard time understanding any questions people ask.", "Communications majors this is the one to take! You will learn so much. He is highly skilled and really cares about making you a better speaker. Best instructor hands down.", "This class is stress free. If you want an easy \"A\" take Mr. Enomoto You don't need a textbook. The final is so Easy and its a take home. No mid Term. Forgot the most important thing Mr. Enomoto lets you leave early to do your homework in the lab. That's if you have any h/w because he lets you do his homework in class. Regardless you leave early.", "Samert, funny, will help for sure. Awesome", "Could I despise this man anymore? His lectures are one random topic after another. He is always late and never knows when the class is over... partially because he doesn't wear a watch. Lost every single one of my papers. Truly awful waste of time.", "Awesome professor. Really helpful and has great sense of humor and pretty cool guy. Not an easy class. Your work ethic will determine your grade so don't blow it off or think it's really easy. It's Not.", "Dr. Perkins was great in this course and helped convince me to become an accounting major. He expects a lot of each student, but is not unreasonable. All the answers to the homework are online, so it's a relatively easy course", "He is not as bad as they make it seem. He has a very thick accent and sometimes it is hard to understand. He gives about ten homework assignments before class but he never gives quizzes or tests. Homework is easy and it all takes about an hour to do. 2 small presentations and one final big group presentation. I would recommend this class.", "Best professor I have had at Denison. Extremely clear and interesting in class. He is also very helpful out of class. I have never met anyone so knowledgeable.", "Awesome, insightful teacher... if you ever need or want to read anything by Spencer, this is the guy to study it with!", "This teacher is terrible, tells stories half the time and although he is hard on you, it doesn't help if he does not teach much.", "Took this class as a gen ed and found it facinating. Salloway is an entertaining lecturer and a very interesting guy but he does dedmand hard work.", "Definitely the best professor I had while attending Evergreen and art school. Incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the art world and a fun professor. I feel he really helped my work grow and pushed me. As a woman, I didn't find him to be anti feminist/woman at all. His retirement is a HUGE loss to the evergreen students.", "what a jerk", "Good teacher willing to help outside of class. Very easy, even though the project may seem difficult at first it really isn't bad.", "I love Allard! I've had him every semester since second year and I have learned a lot from him. I think he's super helpful when it comes to office hours, but easy to make yourself look silly in front of him. Great prof, great lectures!", "He is really arrogant and unfair. Not a very good teacher. Avoid at all costs.", "No Comments", "I was really excited coming into this class, but after 2 weeks of listening to Prof. Afshari's rambling and boasting of how amazing he is, my interest in this class dropped immensely. Papers, easy. Discussions, useless. Videos, awesome. He likes to pick on people and argue with them. And god forbid you yawn or say 'um.' Only take him if necessary.", "No Comments", "No Comments", "asks relevant questions about the text", "No Comments", "Brilliant and has a great sense of humor.", "Awesome professor! First class i took online and it was a great experience! We read 5 small books and they were easy to read and interesting. Take him! Highly recommend", "Dr. Andrews is a great professor, I loved his class! He gives many extra credit opportunities, you just need to read all of the texts to pass.", "It's a history teacher. Lectures the whole time. No study guide for midterm or final. But it is all from notes and entails chose 4/6 definitions for short answer and then an essay (final has 2, 1 is comprehensive). It wasn't too bad.", "Horrible teacher! Ask questions his answer is either I think so or no I can't show examples cause it would take too much class time...I think taking a week to go over the intro of each chapter takes more class time. No one pays attention or shows up for lectures only good thing is he curves every test.", "awesome class because of instructor. would have taken advanced courses had they offered them as night courses instructed by Ed. I put off taking this class -sorry I did. should have taken it sooner.", "Awesome Professor. Funny. Had him for the PHD Micro. Class was very hard, but his teaching was excellent. If you have to start the day with microeconomic theory, this is how you'd want to do it. LOTS of homework.", "Rude, doesn't like to take correction or be told he is wrong and unfair. I do not recommend this instructor unless you are error free in everything you do.", "Professor Abert was an all around decent professor for Calc 2. He struggles in teaching you new material right off the bat, and typically expects that you will have read the section being covered in class before hand. He doesn't curve or drop lowest test grade, but he is a very easy grader on tests, and gives a lot of partial credit on problems.", "Vandergrift....what an interesting fellow... He is hard, but lets face it, it's a complicated subject. It's often difficult to tell the difference between him being serious and joking. DONT BE LATE unless you want the entire class to know your business. If he tells you things won't be on the exam, dont believe him! Cramming is NOT an option", "Professor Fox is an outstanding teacher. He really cares and makes a somewhat difficult subject easy and a lot of fun. I looked forward to going to class every day. I went out of my way to take another class with him next semester.", "Not very helpful at all.", "a bit crazy and unclear, but very helpful and entertaining. Really nice guy", "He's the BEST teacher I have ever had. Take him and you will not regret. Thanks, Todd.", "I took 12 credits with Alsop and I enjoyed his classes and did well in all of them, lots of hard work, tho. If you're stupid, don't take him. Don't recommend him for non-bio majors.", "Really, really funny guy. I was interested in almost all his lectures. Very knowledgable. Lots of homework and quizzes, but they're easy grade boosters. Loved this class.", "The guy is a complete ass. He is rude to his students, if you come in late, need to use the bathroom or ask a question he makes a scene. But it is an easy class. He wont tell you your grade tho- you should just know it. ?", "Pecorino makes EC 430 the hardest class at UA. Do not take him for this course! Half of the class dropped before Halloween, and the other half mostly has Cs. My advisor said this is possibly hardest class at UA taught by one of the worst teachers here.

Really fun, nice guy, has a great sense of humor, and everything is very easy.", "great teacher do all ur work study and get an A", "all you have to do is read", "Is....Was....And still is the best teacher at tech.", "Most boring professor I have ever had. Very monotonous, very difficult to follow at times. Assigned too much reading for full-time students.", "He is a very hard teacher. The lab is easy but the exams are very hard. Just about immposible to get a good grade in lecture. At the begining of class even says that more then half of the class will get a C or lower and eventually drop.", "He is a great professor. Willing to challenge conventional means of teaching and he is extremely brilliant. Granted, he demands you know a bit more than you should coming into the class, but it is a 3000 level course after all. Very lenient and enjoys teaching. He constantly makes you realize that you are capable of my more. Great class overall.", "Excellent teacher - expects a lot from his students but is so inspirational.", "Guys. Take this class. I have learned more about myself through learning about the dark self than at any other point in my life. Not to mention Mark is one of the funniest, nicest and most intellectual professors I have ever had, and never have I been bummed when the hour and fifty minutes is up and I have to wait to go to class again. Amazing", "Just reades from the power point and then talks about himself. He's only told us about how successful he has been at every top job he's hold in his life about 10 millions times.", "I had Dr.Anning his first year teaching at SRU. He's a really nice guy, willing to help. When I had him he seemed slightly nervous teaching in front of the class but if you talked to him one on one afterward he's a great helper and great teacher.", "Dr. Detweiler has a great way of getting a group to come together and blend for a truly beautiful sound.", "Great professor--best at Denison.", "awesome prof. funny, smart, and kind. REALLY HARD MARKER & BRUTAL EXAM, but worth it because his lectures are great. i didn't skip once!", "This class was pretty hard. He did his best to teach it and knew what he was talking about but many students were lost. He also got annoyed when people would ask questions during class. Overall it was decent", "Men in Transition is an easy A", "tough teacher. very 'nit-picky' when grading papers. must follow structure when composing an essay. read the material.", "Seriously, don't take him if you really want to learn something in database. His grading is mostly related to how many times you meet him in his office outside the class. Doesn't discuss any coding at all, doesn't even look at your codes for the project. Teaches from PPT slides only. You'll learn more from books and Google than anything from him.", "By far my favorite Case professor. Very prone to tangents relating concepts to real-life problems. When he first starts explaining a concept, it seems a little circuitous, but when he finishes his derivations it's crystal clear what he was going for. Absolutely brilliant, and always loves talking to students in his spare time.", "He does seem nice, but I don't think Phil 120 is a GPA booster. (Perhaps, I am not suitable for this kind of topic/stuff). The materials were dry and boring...However, if you like logic, you might want to take it, but in my opinion I wouldn't recommend!", "Tony is the****!", "You would not waste your time on his class. I wanted to become a better writer. I learned a lot from his class.", "horrible professor! doesn't teach at all just shows us youtube videos. if this class isn't mandatory then don't take it. biggest waste of my money. i could watch youtube videos at my house for free.", "You definitely need the book because of the online code. Only 3 tests during the term. Easy homework and assignments. If you have essential knowledge in Microsoft office you won't have problems getting a good grade. Sometimes is not clear explaining in class but not a bad teacher. PD: If you ask him many questions he might get mad sometimes. lol.", "This class is hard but Liff is a good teacher, just go to class and do the homework and you'll be fine for the tests. He's pretty funny and goes over the material multiple times, pretty fair grader too just don't miss any labs cause it'll kill your grade.", "Class was extremely boring at some times. The papers (about 6 or 7) were a hassle, but manageable. Easy grader.", "THANK GOD he's not teaching lab this semster. This son of hairless lady is hard.", "Dr. Robel is a difficult professor to like. He insults and belittles his students and he is inflexible in his opinions; however, he is an engaging lecturer, who generally kept me interested. I believe he does care for his students, it just doesn't show.", "Great teacher. Expect to pay attention because he is really dedicated to teaching self defense so if you seem like you don?t want to be there he?ll notice. I think we had one test. Very hands on class. you'll never be sitting down", "HOT, HOT, HOT. Sexy, smart, and gorgeous. Take anything he teaches!", "Unbelievable. Left class for a dentist appointment and expected us to sit around and wait for over an hour for him to get back.", "he is very knowledgable. 5 quizzes that he doesn't really prepare you for, but the midterm and final are both in paper form so you can make up for your grade there. definitely not an easy class, but it is interesting material and the films arent bad.", "I took this through ITV, and it was all I could do to keep from falling asleep.", "I personally did not like his teaching style. Powerpoint slides are not very helpful- he just lists key terms! I had to rely heavily on the book because he spoke very quickly in lecture. VERY HELPFUL tip: if you have to take him, make sure you record all lectures, b/c most of his exams are out of what he says in class!!", "Horrible gives no help to students and expects unrealistic levels of perfection on homework", "Attendance is not mandatory, but going to class will help for exams. 3 Exams. Read the book & take notes on what he says.", "Go ahead and ignore any review that's before 2016 as he's changed his style. 1st 2 tests don't matter grade wise. STUDY THE POWERPOINTS, supplement with the book if needed, do the hw, GO TO CLASS, ask questions so he knows who you are, and the A is yours. If you UNDERSTAND THE PATHWAYS, then the final is easy. His tests were easier than Renthal's.", "I think anyone taking one of Professor Damen's classes will either love him or hate him. He is extremely dynamic and passionate about what he teaches. As a theater person his lectures are like performances. He's anal about how his class is run. The best grading system I have ever had. Loved his class. Great teacher. Not an easy class but not bad.", "A nice guy, and decent teacher. Really likes what he does, and is helpful.", "wow... i do not recomend this class with this professor. i speant half my time trying to figure out what hes saying, and the other half screaming at him. no words can explain this class.", "Filson is great, humorous and friendly! He is incredibly helpful and smart (has a phD in the subject). He seems to understand that students take this intro class simply as a requirement, so he emphasizes learning general ideas, rather than minute details that will be forgotten by anyone who's not a geology major.", "Mr. Shorr is a freak. He yells at students who don't raise their hands. I always felt scared to breathe, let alone speak. He has anger management issues and often seemed like he was about to pull a Dr. David Banner and turn green and rip his shirt off. Beware. I got an A, but it was an ordeal.", "Great Teacher...not so great of a person. I actually did better in this class than I thought I would. Attendance is mandatory (you get 3 after that it's your head) and participation is KEY. I would highly recommend taking a different UW if you can. I didn't really learn anything after this course either. FAIL", "Mr. Thielen was an excellent teacher. The subject matter was not to difficult. He made coming to class a joy. He is very charismatic, and you can tell he enjoys what his work.", "Not a very good professor, but not the worst. Like going to Mcdonalds when you want Chick-Fila.", "Good teacher for Intro To CMPS if you need it for a GE or major. His class was very easy; notes were all online with everything you needed to know. In-class pop quizzes. Fell asleep many times, failed the second midterm, and managed to get a B in the class. Though keep in mind this is more about the history of CMPS rather than programming stuff.", "hard!!!!!!!!!", "Bill not only will teach you things that are required for the class but he will offer advice and suggestions to all that seek it.", "He is a very intelligent man, but should NOT be teaching undergrads. On the first day he told us he does not give his e-mail address out to undergrads. He had us (second years) reading Frye's Anatomy of Criticism, among other difficult and dry texts. His feedback on essays had lots of criticism but few suggestions for improving. Avoid him as a prof", "Mr. Dineen is a excellent teacher. He's very professional.His class used alots of powerpoint which he is very good explaining everything in details. He's very good at teaching but I think that his test is hard but he make sure you truly learn and deserve the education that you need from his class. He's a very nice professor", "Dr. Ryan is AWESOME, he's always willing to help you out. He understands the student's needs. I loved him as a teacher!!!", "he GIVES you the test pretty much- he has outlines for every section he will go over. know these in and out cause they will be the short essays.", "I took intro to drama for what i thought would be an easy elective, it was not. I attended every class and would strongly recommend a different art credit. I made an A in every class including Biology and Chemistry and I promise this class took more studying to pull off an A. The history of Rock in Roll is the best way to go for an art credit.", "As baller as they come. Laid back but always willing to help out the lost and confused. Teaches a v. lucid Methods class that moves along at a crisp pace, infusing practical-type material with nicely coherent conceptual binding. Also has a dope accent you will not be able to imitate, trust me. Class subheading: How To Save The World Using Surveys.", "DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER. HE IS TERRIBLE AT DOING THE JOB HE IS PAID TO DO. AND ON TOP OF THAT HE IS A MEAN SPIRITED PERSON WHO DOESNT CARE FOR STUDENTS", "I took an online class with this professor. He does not return emails or answer questions that student post on the discussion post. If you ask him a direct question, he will not answer it, instead he will get nasty with you. His instructions are not clear. He does not enjoy teaching or care for his students. will ruin your GPA, do NOT take him,RUN!", "Probably the worst CIS class I've taken. While the subject is great, Irv teaches it in a way that's only for those that already know Linux and are extreme geeks. I had a 3.5 CIS and overall GPA and somehow ended up with a C in this class. Irv also hardly teaches as all that you learn is from reading the book and doing your own thing in Linux.", "You can't go wrong with this professor. He has a genuine interest in helping you learn the material and is flexible.", "He kind of floats around. Likes attendance sheets and is overall pretty interesting. He goes kind of slow, so you can get bogged down in material. Just work the crossword or something to fill the time.", "WOW! the easiest English teacher I have ever had in my life. class was based on 3 out of class papers and 2 in class. professor Erickson is extremely helpful when you ask him for help. My skills as a writer have improved thanks to him.", "Has many many stories. Good prof but hard to follow his directions and will change them next class", "this dude gave us like 2 tests the entire term and that was all of our assignments. He talked for about 3 hours nonstop without asking for any student participation. While he is a knowledgable teacher he doesn't know how to teach.", "i love stan so much you have no idea. he's the best, especially compared to a witch like prof. cruise. never take her. never.", "Class was ridiculously easy- an easy A if you care enough to do the work and pay some attention. Dr. Sirkin seems gruff, but is actually a very nice guy. He just expects students to act like adults and take their work seriously- makes sense to me! If you aren't mature enough to be responsible, you probably won't like his class, though.", "Absolutely hilarious. Pretty hard material, but he gets you through it.", "Sit in front to hear him", "Dr. Blythe is a great professor, and I personally view him as one of my mentors as well. If you ever get the chance, do yourself a favor and take a class that he teaches.", "Very fair at marking and is really really funny! His classes were the highlight of my semester, can't wait for PHY 1322!", "Great professor! He explains everything clearly and provides study guides for the tests. He grades fairly and plans his assignments so students can keep up with the workload. I hope I will have the opportunity to be in one of his MBA classes.", "Had Barker for PLS 410 & CRJ 423 (Gangs). He was great. Both very easy classes. He is very knowledgeable in everything he teaches, and writes his own textbooks. Great professor and great dude.

He expects you learn everything AND when you try your hardest for the BEWOLF essay, he will give you a low grade", "I am completely lost in this class.

Always excited to be in class. Cares about students. Very easy on the eyes!", "Super funny and nice guy. His class is pretty easy and you can retake your assignments.", "Dennis is a nice person deep down, but has no place teaching at DeSales. His productions are not art, they are movies on stage.

If you are not math literate I would suggest you take him.", "class is kind of hard, but professor sloan is the best. i never thought i would ever get html or any kind of coding or techie software before this class. i'm learning ALOT very quickly. he knows quite a bit about everything. i'd recommend taking him if you take this class. i heard he is the best emac teacher too.", "Lecturs are hard to get through at times. But are very clear and tests are straight forward.", "No Comments", "I took Social Problems as well as Criminology and I thoroughly enjoyed both classes.

Overall, I would highly recommend taking his classes.", "DO NOT TAKE!!!!!!!!!!", "Throughout the semester I thought I was doing great! The lowest mark I got on his paper was a B! I was never absent in class always participated and at the end I receive a C! I try to talk to him to change the grade he is never there! He is so disorganized!

I don't recommend him at all.", "Professor Allard was a fairly solid professor. You could certainly tell that he was interested in what he was teaching.

I felt that he was also a hard marker.", "EXTREMELY HARD CLASS. this professor knows his stuff but really doesn't know how to teach.

I was worried about taking him. He seemed like he would be a tough teacher that didn't care about students passing (on day one) I couldn't have been more wrong.

Would recommend switching out of his class.", "No Comments", "Good class.", "Very clear lecturer, excited about statistics. Does have an ego but you don't interact with him much anyway.

Take this class, you won't regret it.", "Jerry is a very nice guy outside of class, but two or three times he singled out students during lecture seemingly for the sole purpose of assuming they had made a stupid mistake, for the sake of discussion. His organization was poor, and I think he has somehow gained a monopoly over this course. Others could teach it far better.", "His lectures were not helpful and the final exam was ridiculously hard! Other profs provided slides with detailed information to their students while bruce hammond only put a few graphs on his slides. My friend is currently retaking Econ1021 and you know what, most of the people from that class were from bruce hammond's class last semester.", "Mr. Young is an excellent teacher to have for Trig! He teaches with enthusiasm and offers a lot to help students, especially during his office hours. Be sure to do your homework/practice tests on time!(Had to learn the hard way) Success depends on YOUR efforts, so don't be afraid to ask questions/go in for help. I would highly recommend Mr Young.", "Dr. Kuhlman is probably one of the best professors at Denison. He is the nicest professor I have had here and will do everything in his power to make sure you understand what you need to know. He even goes the extra mile and tries to help based on how you learn. Will take him again and maybe even another time after that!", "Very interesting class. This tacher knows his stuff. You will learn things in this class that you wouldn't learn anywhere else. Great guy, very helpfull", "he's really nice and has a dry sense of humor. he uses repetition and cares if you understad the material. and i think he's cute", "Lectures are interesting, but not always clear. The reading load and tests are very reasonable. It is important to read the material for clarification. He also pays close attention to grammar and spelling on tests.", "this was a good class, and refreshing to be in a class with someone who is actually involved in the industry and has opinions. got me interested in film/techniques/art. one of the more interesting classes i took in my degree. i still actually think about it.", "Chem 12 is chem 12, not very fun. He does his best, much better than any other prof you could have for the course. He tries to be cool, blows stuff up alot.", "I learned so much in this class and it helped me in all subsequent classes. I would highly recommend taking it before physiology especially because it is imperative to have a basic understanding of the body before trying to figure out how it works.", "He is a great Prof. I like his legs personally but he is a man of God and that comes across in his teaching.", "Grades consistently so I guess I haven't figured out how to write to make my grades better. I can see people wanting to grow up to be him. I think as far as class goes, his open discussion instead of lecture is my ideal format for philosophy classes.", "Professor Gongaware is a cool professor. He's really funny and will always listen to you. Although the course starts out rough, you'll definitely get the flow of it.", "Hes so adorable!! TAKE HIM! he lectures a lot but theyre very interesting. hes an excellent anthropologist, and he always has amazing stories to share. he gives a lot of assignments but you have the whole semester to do them, his assignments are very simple. Easy A !", "you never have to read... he pretty much tells reads the chapter for you in class... great teacher and very helpful... take him", "Andrzej's lectures aren't well structured so there's a lot of self learning in this course. Exam questions come from assignments, the textbook, and a test bank. His use of MCQs can be good and bad, good because you can guess, bad because you don't get part marks. It's difficult to do well in this course but it's also difficult to fail.", "SO MUCH FUN! Not an easy class, but definitely worthwhile. Lectures were entertaining and relevant to today's gamers. Highly recommended.", "Great teacher. Pretty easy class. Do the homework and study the pretest and you'll do fine. He has a good sence of humor.", "Absolutely my favourite professor, hands down. Funny, passionate, very caring about his students and the subject.", "I was very turned off by this individual. Too bad he's very very opinionated and can't take a question for a question and not an attack on his views. I'm dedicated to trying to make it through my college career without having him as a teacher.", "Awesome!", "Fabulous professor! He will do anything to ensure you understand whats going on. He has an amazing sense of humor, yet is passionate about what he does. I suggest taking as many courses with him as you can.", "if you cant appreciate his genius it's a reflection on you. Extremely serious abt poetry and demands the same of you. Am repulsed by the whiny ratings of others. He's the best and most caring prof. I've ever had.", "Brad is a great teacher and a true professional. He is very approachable so do not hesitate to go see him if you are having a hard time. His lectures are interesting and well put together. His tests are difficult if you do not follow his review outline. I really enjoyed my experience with him as a prof.", "Don't think you have him figured out the first day. He is sly, like a fox. He is very good at getting you out of your comfort zone. Be open minded and enjoy the class. He is extremly educated and wants us to be also. I recommend him.", "I didn't want to take John Milton but had to have an upper level. Now I'm obsessed with him and the Renaissance era. This was most intense experience I've had at Eastern, and pretty much every one of Dr. Rahimzadeh's lectures blew our minds. He's brilliant and passionate and he is beautiful to look at and listen to. Take anything he teaches.", "This teacher is horrible, he cannot make into class on time and then spends the rest of class talking about how he is smarter than all the people he works for.", "This class was so freaking hard. I'm sure its easy for mathsciency people.. but this was just really confusing to me. The lecture was so freaking boring. he is a nice man though!!", "Kind of a pain in the butt, but one of the BEST teachers I've ever had. :-) A fabulous musician!", "He is an awesome teacher. He makes it easy to learn and tries to help you as much as possible. 2 tests + 2 papers. Def take him- he's really nice and cares a lot. I'm taking him again next semester.", "VERY tough grader. Your work has to be perfect in order to receive credit. However, the assignment very, very clearly defines its requirements, and you even get a chance to correct and resubmit your projects after the grades are released. Exams are open-notes, -book, and -Internet. Follow his instructions exactly and you'll do fine.", "I LOVED this teacher. He seems super intimidating and grumpy at first but he was so great. Study for his exams and you'll ace them. He's funny, he interacts with the students, kids around about all sorts of stuff. All around awesome teacher!", "One of the most joyful professors I have ever had. He obviously teaches because that is what he loves doing. He never makes you feel pressured to learn, but rather just makes all sort of information available to you, and what you choose to do with it is really up to you. Highly, highly recommended!", "George Williams is one of the greatest guys out there. I took many classes with Willy G and always found his lectures to be very enjoyable.", "Like watching a stand-up comedian! He must get really tired after teaching!", "he is not easy and never trust you.do not take this class with him...", "Best teacher ever. I couldn't believe he was even still teaching here.", "One of the best professors I've ever had. His lectures are so entertaining that even when mind-numbingly topics like botany present themselves, he manages to grasp your attention. I recommend him to anyone that wants to have an incredibly clear understanding of biology, while laughing the entire time.", "Jazz history was the easiest class ever...easy A", "Classes are not really necessary, but experiments are fun and the exams aren't too difficult. I really enjoy the case studies that he brings up in class. He definitely is one of those teachers that you either like or you dont.", "A really great teacher that really cares about the subject matter and his students!", "Dr. Hardy is HORRIBLE at teaching.. He need to improve in his teaching skills. Attending class everyday is a MUST or you will be left behind. He will give you extra credit to help your grade. He's sorta fair when he feels like it. Go to the tutoring lab because they will help you! I won't recommend his class to people who have a hard time in math.", "He's a great lecturer but he doesn't have an email, and doesn't post notes online so be prepped to write your own good notes as he lectures fast. Also I wouldn't be concerned about asking questions in class as he will ignore you. He marks harder than my 300 level profs & doesn't give remarks on how to do better just calls undergrads stupid a lot", "Took for PLC, do not recommend. Lectures are meaningless, tests are brutally specific. Projects are simple but very poorly explained both because instructions are unclear and because he doesn't teach the material required. Prepare to spend a lot of time in his office or exchanging emails, which he can take a day to respond back to.", "I don't like him... He makes me sleepy.", "Good professor. Lectures are interesting, makes the class fun to attend. Likes giving pop-quizzes, homework is easy points, takes attendance. Harsh grader on exams, be as precise and clear with answers as possible or he wont give credit.", "He is an awesome teacher. Very easy class and easy to talk to. He makes learning fun and an overall great teacher!! I recommend taking him if you can! You only have to right 2 papers all semester with a length of 3-4 pages!", "Ew...the not hot factor cause he's like older than my dad. Way talented teacher and if you get on his good side he will definately help you when you need it. If you like Basketball and hate marching band you'll be his fave:)", "THERE ARE 2 TWO EXAMS . ONE LOWEST GRADE DROP. THE PROFESSOR OPENS MANY WAYS TO EARN EXTRA BONUSES CREDITS.", "Hands down WORST \"teacher\" ever. DROP NOW!! He is not helpful and takes joy in handing out 0's. Consider yourself warned...", "This guy has no idea what's going on. Half the time he doesn't know what day it is. He accidentally gave our midterm to the wrong class. His lectures are pointless and you will learn nothing. 10/10 would not take again.", "His powerpoints summarize what's in the book. Problem is, his voice is very low and I get bored easily. He's cool cause you can just surf the web. But you have to read the book to keep up, don't rely on his lectures they go all over. 6 simulations and a case project (mandatory for this class and section any way), midterm and final.", "This man is a genius. He was by far the best professor I had at Western. His lectures were insightful, meticulous, and often times hilarious. Best of all, he tactfully and efficiently poke fun of idiots (i.e. his grammar lectures after an essay test!).", "No Comments", "He's very specific on his grading material and really goes into depth on what should be included in your papers to make page count and write good content. He's very approachable and has a lively attitude, loves his job. Only down side is he doesn't critique papers at all if you're already a good writer. Easy class and great prof overall.", "Kahn seems to know a lot about Labor Econ but I could not get past the constant licking of the fingers. In a 50 minute lecture, the guy stuck his hands in his mouth over 60 times, I counted - I've heard varying accounts approaching 80. The class had 4 professors and I think I learned the least from Kahn - just not a great teacher but very knowledgable.", "He was a great math teacher, and his enthusiasm for math really showed. I woils warn future students his accent makes him hard to understand. It took me about two weeks to be able to understand him.", "You \"will\" pass the class if you really want to. For the ones who are not serious & miss class alot, you will fail. Trust me. Take Sato for lab. You'll be glad you did. Vandergrift's lectures are confusing & seem to not make sense. Just read the book & study guides given & you'll be fine. Most of all, try not to take his attidude too seriously.", "Focuses much more on knowledge of concepts then on formulas, which can be a refreshing change. Course feels more like an engineering course then most other ENGR courses. Can wander off topic in lectures though, and man does he Love those steam charts.", "THis professor is the best. he wnat you to pass witha good grade. Just seeing his enthusiam at his age makes you smile. he loves what he does. Not a difficult class. Easy A. You eat alot of Candy in this class. Discussions are really meaningful", "he might be boring btu take good notes and you will be fine. dont forget to read the book its very important his curve is huge and its very easy to get an a. but u do have to study in advance for it", "Don't listen to the guy three comments down from mine. Edg is a good teacher. He teaches because he wants to, not because he has to. Its a fun and very easy class. Just write down whats in the margins and bold print, follow the study guide and its an easy A.", "The best professor I have had at York. He is so passionate about his work and extremely engaging. One of the only classes that I found time flew by during lectures. I would highly recommend rearranging your schedule to take his class. If you go to class, and read his notes, you will do well. He often reuses his quiz questions on the midterm & final", "Amazing Prof, great class. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have decided to major in sociology. Wish he taught more classes.", "2nd week of class. Love it love it love it. Professor Blitz has a reputation that he's very demanding and scary. Maybe that's how it will be, but after two double-period classes, he's already my favorite professor out of 5 previous semesters.", "basically hell in a classroom. Only take this class if you are ridiculously interested in saints and are very catholic.", "He's interesting and knowledgable. Was an amazing teacher for social psych, but is quite lazy in his methods for personality theory. Prefers to make us sit in small groups most the time and teach ourselves. I dont pay for classmates opinions or to teach myself the book...he should be held accountable for this...i want my money back!!", "By far the best teacher I have ever had. He is a wealth of knowledge on law enforcement and makes even the most boring subject interesting. If you comment that his class is hard you must be braindead. If you go to class and pay attention, you will do very well. Wish he taught graduate classes!", "No Comments", "Sadkowski is pretty cool. He likes to lecture a lot, but does include some discussion and movies. His tests are difficult, but he gave us all of our study guides on the first day. His papers are demanding though.", "WEB class: hardly used the sucky book, just lookedup the answers online. Didn't really do much, but post a discussion (which he LOVES) as little as possible and guessed my way through the tests. He answers all your questions promptly.", "No Comments", "He's a smart and funny guy. He goes off topic here and there, but he covers all the information he needs. You will actually learn in his class. If you like history you'll like him. The class is pretty much just lecture with 3 midterms. It's not the easiest class that you'll ever take, but it's also a class made for freshmen.", "Mark is one of the most influential Professors I have ever had. I look up to him as a father figure. He is extremely knowledgeable and wise. Very traditional and passionate at what he does.", "His exam questions ALL came from the example problems in class, you knew what to expect on the exam. Easy A if you attend class and rework the examples. His passion for finance and his jokes every now and then made the class enjoyable considering it's finance.", "He is a great Professor. I have learned so much in his class. He makes class fun and very interesting. He shows how physics applies in our life. He is very knowledgeable about the subject and I would highly recommend him as a physics teacher.", "Bad attitude, bad professor. What else is there to say?", "Dr. Frank is a great professor! His lectures tend to be on the boring side but he tries to make it entertaining by throwing in jokes. Tests are easy if you REALLY study the study guides. Always willing to help and work around your schedule. Always writes nice comments and smiley faces on exams if you do well! He's great!", "This is the best professor ever! If you don't love him, you are a lazy incompetent waste of space!", "Avoid him at all costs.", "Not a bad professor, tests are very hard, quizes arn't too bad if you read. Tests are Essay answers. Seems like he doesn't like to give out A's to students. He will ALWAYS find somthing wrong with your essays. Had to work pretty hard to get a B+ in the class. I wouldn't take him again.", "impossible course! worst class I ever took! Definitely not an 'intro' course!", "Great teacher. Very clear and straightforward. He is very organized and answers question very nicely. The tests are stuff that are covered in class/discussion/homework. So just go to all the class sessions, discussions, and do the homework and you'll be fine. Speaking of which, the homework is not too difficult, like it was in EECS 12 (with Lin).", "I'm NOT impressed. I do agree that he is easy and I do love the way he teaches. But, unfortunately, he doesn't seem very sympathetic towards students with disabilities.", "He knows his material, but isn't helpful.", "I really like Prof Fey. He is helpful and I think really looks out for his students best interests. The tests are hard but he always gave free points and his lectures are somewhat boring but he does his best to make them interesting. I recommend!", "He is a pretty easy professor. Really funny at times. I enjoyed his class and his personality. The class is interesting and you need to just attend the lectures in order to pass his exams. I would recommend this class.", "Hilarious, but very knowledgeable...good prof!", "A truly horrible professor. Very unhelpful, not available after class, insults his students, does not know the material, makes many mistakes while going over reviews for tests. Only gives two tests during the semester, which the class grade is besed solely on. I give Michael Scarlatos an F- grade!", "Good professor. Very knowledgeable. Basically class consists of reading (aprx. 30 pages/wk), class worksheets, midterm + final. Class can be boring, but he is very nice, and knows his stuff. put in the effort and you will get an A.", "Prof. Fox is an amazing teacher. Even if students are not interested, Prof. Fox motivates them. He is fun in class and lvoes joking around with students. Very reasonable and clear expectations for class and tests. He is an absolutely wonderful teacher.", "Dr. Gruenert is intelligent and he expects you to be intelligent as well. He treats his students with respect and understanding and teaches for a practical world.", "Read the textbood and don't bother going to class", "Definitely insane... he could work on connecting his ideas so that his lectures are more cohesive.", "FYI Professor Scott Peters is listed on MyUniverse as Christopher S Peters. Dr. Peters has been an amazing professor for every class I have taken with him. He is so knowledgable on our county's courts system, and he is so good at teaching in a way that is understandable to those with no knowledge of law or politics. Highly recommend this professor!", "Funny but not realistic", "Truly inspiring. Never preaches. Shows you the door and leaves the rest for you to explore. If I could go back to school again, I will definitely love to learn more from him!!", "Whitehead is a very clear, concise teacher who really makes an effort to make the material somewhat interesting. He doesn't try to trick you and the class is very laid back and, for an engineering class, really decent.", "Jason is a great teacher always is getting you to push what you are doing at the moment.", "Best math teacher I've ever had. Had to drop calculus twice before taking his class, but got a B with him.", "He is a little confusing, I think. He does things ont he board that doesn't even matter. I would recommend going to class, but he is really nice and helpful if you are having problems.", "Pratt should never, ever have become a professor.", "The class was uninteresting, he was frequently incorrect and I didn't so much care for his humor.", "he was hard and picked favorites. DO NOT GET ON HIS BAD SIDE!", "Hard everything. No review. I mean it RUN!!", "An extremely easy A. If you don't mind listening to the ramblings of an older prof, whose lectures are too much useless opinion and not enough substance.", "Reimer is awesome. His class is extremely easy! He has no tests and all you have to do to pass the class is show up. Total work for this class is 15 (5 question) quizes and 10 labs. Easiest college class you will take. I lifted weights every single class period. He's a nice guy and doesn't care what you do at all. Strongly recommend him!", "No Comments", "He is a very smart man with a terrible dry sense of humor. Grades papers quite tough. Follow his examples and write papers exactly like he suggests and you'll ace the class.", "Mr. B is very enthusiastic about speech, he loves what he does and it shows. Hes very easy to talk to, and will give you feedback on his thoughts of your speech. He creates a comfortable environment in his classroom so when you go up to speak it isnt scary. You must show up to his class or you wont pass, he keeps track of attendance.", "ABOVE ALL A GREAT PERSON. HE IS A GREAT TEACHER. HIS CLASS IS EDUCATIONAL AND ENTERTAINING. GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR!!!! I WISH HE TAUGHT OTHER CLASSES!!!! MY BEST FIU PROFESSOR TO DATE.", "Very very very very easy class, but a complete waiste of money.", "Alexakos is one of the most interesting professors at Santa Fe. Really gets you interested in the material and explains it in a way that everybody can understand. Class is really tough and there is a strict attendance policy, but going to class will be not a problem. Very interested in philosophy after this class. highly recommended", "Very nice but confusing way of teaching. Talks to low and too many long pauses. Very roundabout instead of straight to the point and doesn't go over what is going to be on the exam just say study everything! Lets students participate to much that he gets off track and waste class time.", "Best prof ever. He was a partner at Cravath, so he has a REAL understanding of business law. If you are tired of the theory/policy **** of other classes and the disconnect between what you learn in class and what you'll do in practice, you will LOVE any class taught by Widen. Exam is difficult but exactly what you expect, no cheap tricks.", "Pay attention in class. Take notes, study the notes, and you will do fine.", "Not good. Goes into rages when stressed. Be careful.", "Quereshi is a funny teacher. take his class if you are looking to pass math 220. I hate math, but he made it not so bad.", "very good prof.. puts interest of students at the top. Does not lie about his exams, very easy.. just study the text and go to his lectures. Willing to help at any time and clarify things if needed, very considerate and nice.. approachable too, take his class as elective..you'll definitely enjoy it", "He looks like Santa Claus, no joke. On a more serious note though, his class isn't particularly difficult as long as you spend a whole lot of time studying and memorizing stuff. There usually is a curve both on the exam itself as well as for your last grade.", "He only has you do a few writing assignments, which isn't bad but he's very unclear. He definitely doesn't follow his syllabus and threw in a surprise Final at the end after saying we were done w/ work, wasn't cool at all. Plus he graded it harder than any other paper bringing down my grade big time", "I have had Todd as a professor on and off for 4 years now and he is a great guy. You can learn a lot from him and he is always there to help students with anything. He is charismatic and his classes are not hard. They just rely on a lot of theory and experience as opposed to textbook facts. He really knows what he's teaching.", "Incredibly rude and unprofessional. Likes to demean students and embarrass them in front of the class.", "Web-based: I wish most teachers designed their web-based classes like Mr. Unger. He was thorough, clear, and creative in how he got us participating as a group. I learned morea about my classmates in this class than in a traditional class! Read, study, interract, and take the open-book quizzes and tests. You will pass w/an A with a little effort.", "Nice guy and cares about his students. BUT, really tough course for first year and really hard tests. Ridiculously hard. MUST go to class!!!", "Take the Skeptic's Manifesto... not just because you want an easy grade (which it is), but because you're interested... because you will learn a lot, get an A, and have an awesome professor (who somehow can relate anything to limestone)A+! hilarious prof", "One of few profs here who actually tries to get students to enjoy the class.", "Jim is extremely nice and understanding. He's a great guy who really wants to make his class interesting. Those who took 80k and feel he was unclear or stubborn are wrong!

He even let me make up a midterm!", "he's so easy study your notes n show up to class n you'll be just fine, will give help if you ask, labs require some extra studying but he basically tells you what will be on it", "His exams are way harder than his quizzes and the homework he assigns. I got A's and B's on all his quizzes. I went to tutoring 3x a week and to peer study sessions once a week. I went to him for help and was told that he doesn't expect much from his students and he doesn't understand why I'm struggling. I attended every lecture.", "I took his class for an easy A. I have a background in Finance as my family has been in different financial and investment fields for decades. It was an easy class.. if you agree with him. As a licsenced broker with 3 years of experience, I disagreed with some of the things he said. It wasn't a boring class, though.", "If u are taking his 228 math class, its easy. He is a good guy (keep using some bad jokes in his class). A little harsh about test. His homework is not too much. He said he did not like 124 or 129 class maybe thats y some people didnt feel good about their class.", "SO EASY!! Highly recommend. MWF class but he does not have class Fridays - instead you have to write two paragraphs on a given topic and that's. He's super nice and there's virtually no work involved with the class and he tells you word for word what will be on the test. EASIEST CLASS EVER.", "1st year classes are easy, upper year classes require a lot more investment in time. A great guy and prof. I went through some tough times and he helped me out more than most. He knows his stuff cold.", "Loves C's like they proved his teaching skills. Is ill tempered and generally just annoying, avoid if you can, especially for reporting.", "Karpinski is definitely a real gem. He gives you extra time to turn in papers. He is a fair grader. He has amazing lectures. He is more interested about you knowing the material than passing, so you most definitely will pass if you just show little effort in the class. I LOVE this man. I'm graduating if not, I'll take him again. ONE OF THE BEST!!!", "Should not be teaching! Very unorganized. Does the majority of teaching through the students giving presentations. Spends more time on soapbox blaming all of Mexico's problems on white North Americans.", "Great Professor! His class isn't easy, but you learn a bunch.

Definitely would recommend!", "i love this man. he is the best chemistry professor. if u hate and dont understand jack sht then take him. he explains really well, gives alot of examples, and doesnt move on until hes sure everybody gets it. the book isnt needed, but it helps cos u do problems off of it and it helps for the exams. hes funny too. great overall!", "Best math teacher I ever had! Highly recommend his class. I would take him for every math class if I could.", "If you pay attention, turn work in on time and follow his instructions you will breeze by.

Do not take if you are not an English major!", "Great Teacher, very enthusiastic about class. Can be unclear about assignment.", "Very reasonable professor. He made the class enjoyable. Would find a way to relate material to real world application.", "Although very unclear, he's a great prof. His lectures go all over the place, but he relies on the texts, so if you bring those to class you'll understand his lectures. He's willing to help and wants people to do well in his class. He has a great knowledge of the subject matter, but can be a little vague about what he wants in assignments.", "The materials covered in this class are informative and interesting, and Prof. Cooke is helpful too. The only issue I have with the class is the opinionated questions on the quizzes.", "Matthew is a good professor. The quizzes though are very hard unless you spend a lot of time studying.", "There are no words to describe the torture his class inflicted on me. He is disorganized, unclear, boring and shares too much personal information. The were not that bad but his lectures were horrible! Avoid him!", "I wouldnt call this a class because it is not really a class. Students basically teaching themselves. Weekly quizzes from questions at the end of the book. Exams are tough, but he gives a great curve. Read the BOOK, or else you will struggle with the exmas.", "Intimidating at first, but he's nice once you get to know him. Follow directions, don't ask stupid questions and don't screw around in lab.", "Dr.teitell is a great guy. He makes you understand the material and that is his first priority. Exceptional knowledge he is a gift to Devry. yet some do a disservice to themselves by cheating, because he is not a stickler. one of the most valuable classes I have ever taken.", "Amazing professor! He's so down to Earth and he will stop at nothing to help you learn.", "Contracts-had no book. Focus on the UCC and the Restatement. Buy Crunch Time to follow the course and E&E to do practice problems. Skim over the cases to understand what concepts and what part of hte UCC and the RST he will go over in class. Do NOT focus on the cases!", "Get organized and stay organized! Very good instructor. VERY knowledgable. Assignments pile up quick, but there is always plenty of lead time.

Opportunities are provided for extra credit.Good luck!!!", "great teacher and extremely helpful inside and outside of the classroom.", "Excellent professor. Really knows his topic, and imparts his enthusiasm to his students. Highly recommended.", "He is a great guy, very funny and the class was not boring at all. He does not teach from power points, so expect to be writing down what he says in class. The readings are important to do. Class consisted of 2 canvas postings, one quiz, group presentation, and a cumulative final.", "He may come off as a bit mean, but it's really because he's strict. He's clear cut and he tells his students what to expect. You know exactly what grades you have in his class. Very organized. If you get to know him better, he will help you out. He looks thru BS and people who've \"scraped by.\" Ask for help/advice and you'll get it.", "He is really lax about getting grades into the computer.", "Professor Rose gives a lot of homework and reading. It is a lot to keep track of but he does send out helpful emails keeping you up to date. The workload is worth it because the lectures are very interesting and the homework/paper topics usually are as well. Beyond that, Prof Rose is just a pleasant professor to have and his passion is contagious", "The good: Funny guy, knows his stuff, fair grader, says at least one ridiculously hilarious thing per class. Bad: Can make the simplest idea incomprehensible, rambles on for hours. Someone else said it - I have no doubt he knows what he's talking about, he just doesn't have a knack for explaining things (and he goes off on confusing tangents)", "No Comments", "Hill is a nice guy. Class is unconventional since students have to read the chapters and present to the class while Hill comments. As a result, class moves really slow and some students do a half ass job. Tests are insanely hard but the curve really helps. Participation really counts towards your grade. Assigns a ton of reading and labs.", "He's an overall nice guy but this class is very stressful. If you aren't good at math you will struggle. It was hard to follow along and there aren't much tutoring hours. My TA doesn't help much and from what I heard, the other ones don't either. If you're feeling lost and it doesn't seem any better, DROP THE CLASS. He tried to help though.", "well i dont have much to say about this guy but i will say hes a easy marker but u have to study on your own cuz he doesnt give notes or slides but its ok course if u dont know nothing about philsophy then stay away or at least away from him", "Dr. Ruckh is that one crazy college professor that everyone hears about, but no one seems to find. You'll find that it won't be easy; the assignments are very ambiguous, but if you talk with him and honestly try in this class, the results are extremely rewarding. Truly deserves to be called a teacher.", "I took his class, and enjoyed it. He gave curves and I got a B without studying much. You really have to listen in class, and take notes. Very intelligent guy. He makes a few jokes which are missed by most of the class.", "He has set ideas politically and if your speech happens to conflict with his beliefs, your grade will reflect it. Even if your research is extensive, he'll discredit it because he doesn't agree with your point. I feel like people who side with him politically love him because he grades to encourage his beliefs... So much for \"open debate/dialogue.\"", "Great teacher, has a hard time pronouncing simple words though.. like ode for example..", "Definitely the hardest class I've taken at UA. He makes up his own versions of the textbook graphs with about 2 examples, on the hw and study guide. Then he changes the graphs on tests in every possible way, and be ready for him to take off points for your lines not being perfectly tangent and minor labeling errors. Would NOT recommend!", "Wonderful professor! Taught me everything I needed to know to work as a forensic psychologist in a prison. He knows his material from working in the real world - a wonderful change from boring professors that only teach theory and research!One of the best, if not THE BEST professors I ever had.!", "Great guy. Understands that we're college students, and knows it's just a requirement for most of us. I was born and raised a Catholic and learned more about the religion than I have my whole life. Didn't mind being in his class on a Thursday night", "Dr. Fisher is really funny. He's undoubtedly very knowledgable, but he lectures EXTREMELY fast. I recommend rewatching Tegrity for his lectures, because he often elaborates on his slideshows & says things that're not written down but that he will test you on. On the tests, he usually never takes questions directly from his HW, he rewords them", "I don't recommend you take this professor for Business Stats in the summer...he is unclear about the information given in the class. He may be better in a regular quarter!", "He is so confused. The guy just has no idea how to teach. There were many times when he would write a problem on the board, realize he did it incorrectly, and ended up erasing the whole thing and taking another 10 minutes to reteach it, and that was just one of the many problems in that class. If you value you what you're learning, do not take him.", "This teacher is easy but I didn't learn very much", "Worst prof ever, he doesnt care about his students lives. I sometime question his true intentions", "Okay, Fruscione seems like a good guy. Definitely not an \"easy\" or \"generous\" grader... His moods seem to change frequently, sometimes he's really friendly, other times, he essentially will tell you have no concept of the English language whatsoever...This class was a lot of work for UW...", "Incredibally difficult professor, however, his class cuts all of the slackers from the program. Most people take his class TWICE! But to pass, as I learned in my 2nd semester with him, just show up to class. Most test questions are from HW!", "Barden was by far my favorite teacher. He is hilarious and makes microbiology interesting, easy to understand, and lectures aren't boring. You DONT NEED BOOK. All tests could be done right off of his slides. Amazing professor.", "Good professor, interesting, and very easy class!", "While much more cantankerous and demanding than most professors, Professor Bloom retains an incredible degree of integrity. It took me a good seventy percent of the semester to warm up to him, but venerable and somewhat-scary character that he is, I hold him in the highest esteem.", "He's a hard grader (I got a B-) yet one of the best professors I have ever studied with at Denison. Expect to read a lot, but the workload is still manageable. His lectures were really good and enjoyable (provided you read the textbooks).", "Why does Dr. Andy not have a chili pepper? THE BEARD!", "LOVE THE FISH SHIRTS.", "I regret coming to Western because of this man. Not only is he an awful teacher but he is a terrible person. We pay all this money to get an education, we put endless ours of studying in and no matter how hard you try, you will not do well because he purposely wants his students to fail. Because of him, I now have a negative outlook on western.", "He's an excellent teacher, always willing to help. Lecture is very interesting. Be prepared to work hard. He is hottt!!!", "Good class.", "Smart guy and nice, but he just can't teach. I believe that he lets politics interfere with honest grading and teaching.", "He is a great professor. very helpful. I liked his class, and enjoyed doing his assignments. You must go to tutoring to better yourself. He is funny as well. pretty cool guy.", "Professor Strong wants you to learn the material so he will make you work for your grade. If you take your education seriously and don't expect to have your grade handed to you, take this class. This class taught me how to study for a test without memorizing general information. Truly one of my favorites.", "He is not very helpful and does not care to work with students. If you take his online class know that his test are only open from 7am to noon. Which is not very helpful for anyone that works and goes to school. He also will not allow you to print or save study material. Again very unhelpful to someone who works and goes to school.", "BRILLIANT!", "One of the best professors I have had. I would recommend him over any MQM 385 teacher. People who complain about this class are those who like definitive problems/results and struggle to think outside the box. He may grade you lower, but there are so many points that it is impossible to not get at least a 'B'.", "very easy class, just make sure you study for his tests and hand in the paper on time. class is interesting he can be kind of boring though sometimes. great professor.", "What Allison is to baking, he is to cooking. Offers good advice. He's been there, done that. Listen to him.", "How anyone could possibly not adore Alan(sp?) Bell is beyond me. He is smart, open, engaging, charming and quirky--not to mention a phenomenal writer. Layout and marking is fair, films are interesting and diverse. Thank you Alan!", "tries to cover way too much material, but is understanding and kind.", "Dr. Rahimzadeh is brilliant and he knows it. Which can be very annoying. He's been everywhere, he's read everything, and he thinks he's right about everything. But he's also the nicest, most supportive, funniest professor I've had at Eastern. And yes he's nice to look at. If you don't take his class you are missing out on a key EKU experience.", "Dr. Karpinski is by far one of the best professors at DePaul University. Every time I left his class, he helped me look at the world from a completely different perspective. He is extremely understanding and is always there to help out. Simply put, every professor should be like him. You will miss out if you don't take this class.", "I loved him. He cares about his students. Go to class, do the work, and you'll get a good grade. I went back to school after many years and he helped me more than any other professor. He's fun and interesting. I wish I had more classes with him. A great professor. Easy A if you try.", "Awesome professor! 2 papers 2 exams but all really easy! Attend Class to get the most points and doing all the work, which is very little, will definitely get you an A!", "Stoever is overflowing with knowledge and he has that sketchy genius personality that I dig in a prof. Probably one of the most influential professors I've had to date.", "His lectures were very confusing. He pretty much talked and occasionally wrote words on the board. You can get by without doing much of the reading and it was an easy B+.", "Bad.", "Dr. Robel is an excellent professor! His teaching methods are inspiring - he's fun and enthusiastic.", "Very good professor with an interesting teaching style. Tests are not that hard if you understand the material and pay attention to everything he says in class. He will always answer any questions by making you answer it, so be ready. Grade consists of a midterm, final, three quizzes and an optional group project. Take him if you enjoy finance.", "Good Teacher.", "One of the greatest professors you'll ever have. I took Ancient World with him, a class that I wasn't particularly interested in, but he made it relevant and interesting. I would've loved a higher grade but I don't regret taking it b/c he's an awesome person to know (Dean of Arts & Sciences) and REALLY cares about his students. Take his class!", "Kawchuck is one of the best profs I've had at UofC. Wicked sense of humour and extremely charismatic - makes an 8 am class worth your while to attend.", "Quite enjoyable. Just wish he'd use a little more explanatory textbooks.", "I absolutely LOVED him! He made his lectures interesting, and I actually looked forward to going to class. He made a booklet of all the study guides and lecture outlines for us to take notes on, all you had to do was go to CopyWorks and buy it. There were a few videos, but mostly lecture information was on tests.", "Both books outdated, one by 9 years. He did not explain his way on how to turn in assignments properly. Explanation for everything is repetition of syllabus and reread. 4 open days is required to meet. He insulted students and scares students from giving instruction on discussion board. The download is provided to him.", "I had him for both 101 and 102. If you're taking 101 as an elective or as an engineering major, DO NOT TAKE HIM. If you're premed or chemistry related major, power through and you will learn a ton, which helps in later courses. Tests are hard but if you put in the work and do a lot of practice problems it's doable.", "Not a very good prof. His notes are VERY confusing and all over the place. Definitely preferred the other profs. Plus his exam questions weren't straight forward at all - very tricky.", "Not bad, even though I did not like the course material.", "I took the radio astronomy course with Professor Bartel and I have to say he is one of the best profs I've ever had! The course is very math heavy but if you do the assignments, ask questions in class, and listen to his lectures, you will be okay. He makes the material so interesting! You'll definitely learn something. Absolutely recommend Bartel!", "This guy is very interesting. His lectures aren't really helpful when it comes to the tests. With that said he gives a lot of extra points during class so showing up is a good idea. If you read the book it's an easy A. He does have a tendency to drone on about himself but the stories are pretty funny (and almost unbelievable).", "No Clear Enough. He seems not understand the lecture..", "Was a very hard teacher, but very good. I learned a lot taking his class. He is a very good instructor and will work with you if you don't understand something.", "HOT!!!!", "revise..you'll get a better grade...no matter what", "I took Professor Burns for Calc II. This professor really knows his stuff. He is very funny and is willing to explain to you until you understands the material. He give practice test before exam and it goes over. if you study the practice test you will pass the exam. Recorded his lecture, posted on YouTube any time you could access and review.", "This was the worst math class I have ever taken. I know some would strongly disagree but heasr me out. After taking calculus in high school from a fantastic teacher, I entered this class with the feeling that it wouldn't be too difficult. Granite I am a freshman and this was my first quarter in college, I did not expect it to be that bad. I was", "No Comments", "Dennis is a wonderful teacher! He is truely dedicated and makes learning an unforgettable experience. His approaches to things are great, and he is just downright hilarious! Dennis rocks!", "Very nice teacher, funny, always a discussion class. He brings viewpoints from theorists and get deep into their mind. You really are there for the teacher. The readings are sometimes difficult to understand.Not too structured of a class, always flips around subjects.", "Do not take this class from Jerry unless you really REALLY love math. Jerry makes the tests much harder and longer than they need to be! His Final took many students 4-5 hours to complete, is this legal?? His lectures and HW assignments are pretty good. Don't miss his lectures, or you will be bitten. I wish I had not taken this class from him.", "scaryyyyyyyyyyyyyy", "His class, though I found it challenging, is easier than other schools. The key to his class is not to just blindly copy whatever he writes, but to pay attention to what he says, and take notes on those things. While maybe not the most clear instructor, he's one of the nicest people, and even once photographed his class for his grandchildren :)", "Love dthe class. Dr. Langley is a very effective lecturer.", "He is very knowlegable about history! He really knows his stuff and can answer pretty much any question. He can be difficult to approach with questions at times, but he tries to be available to his students.", "Clear and organized notes.", "Attendance is mandatory, but he makes that clear on the first day. (Seriously, why is it so hard for peeps to go to class?) 3 easy quizzes, 4 online discussions, a final exam, and a final 8-10 page paper. Incredibly organized! Textbooks and lectures are dense but informative. Great polysci professor!", "Very funny during lectures, keeps you engaged for the most part and makes everything easy to understand. Took him for both Bio Principles and Bio DIversity, and glad I did. GO TO THE LECTURES! Everything he says during lecture is fair game for the exams, which are a bit difficult, but if you pay attention and do what he asks you'll have no problem.", "I liked this class a lot. I thought that using movies to write papers on the subject matter was an interesting idea. He used some audio CDs in this class that were really good. Made us think about things we otherwise would not have.", "every test we have taken i went to his office and he was able to show me on the outline where the answer was. True there are no assignments but there is optional extra Credit if U do all of them it will raise your final grade a whole letter grade. U have to study isn't that why you're in school? It is not an EASY A but he is more than fair. D'Bora", "He makes attendance mantory, so if you want the 10% participation, you must go to every single class. easy quizzes. marking was unfair for midterm. did not specify what he wanted but when he marked, it was very specific. the marks ranged from 50 to 100. take home final.", "He is an interesting teacher who tries hard to entertain the class. My only problem with him was that his tests are very difficult even if you study. He is very intelligent and knows his stuff. I would suggest him, but just be prepared for hard tests!!", "This teacher is really cool, he was a USC professor. This class is very easy. To compare with another Human4 teacher Forman, Mr Catalano did teach something, take him, you will get A", "I'm often torn on my opinion of this guy. He takes a very practical, historical approach to film studies which is refreshing considering how bogged down his department is in heavy theory. Fascinating and useful research interests, but he's so quiet he barely seems to even be there at times. He doesn't lecture so much as recite lullabies.", "If you pay attention and take notes, anyone can pass it. If you have hard time paying attention and need to be guided every step of the way, then take somebody else.50% of the work is on your own, but he will help out.", "AVOID AT ALL COSTS!", "this class was really easy. go to class take notes. study for the tests [10 t/f one essay] 3 tests + participation grade. piece of cake...oh and A's start at 80", "I honestly believe that my 6 year old could have got an A in this class. I still don't have a clue what Forensic Accounting is but I have an A on my record.", "He tries hard to explain study after study, but never quite puts everything into context. He is enthusiastic about Social Psychology on a personal level and that really shines through, but he is not a natural born teacher and that hurts his ability to pass on his enthusiasm effectively to the class. Always available for office hours. Very nice guy!", "Mr. Ream goes out of his way to help you understand the material and he provides great feedback. He has a great sense of humor and is never afraid to admit when he's wrong. He loves statistics and used real life examples which made learning much easier. I really enjoyed the semester (Spring 2015) and would most certainly take another of his classes", "Amazing teacher, always available to help me out when I had questions, I look forward to having him for my next two sciences classes. AMAZING. A lot of work, but received an A in the end. :)", "he can barely even speak english, hes mad confusing and not helpful at all", "Clear, thought-out lectures. Coursework can be demanding, and tedious at times. Has a strange pechant for THHGTTG.", "Owen is fantastic. He is a really nice guy and a great teacher. If you have any trouble, he is always available to his students. I would love to take another one of his classes.", "Worst professor I have ever had. He doesn't answer questions correctly and is useless when it comes to out of class help. He is disorganized and does not know the material he teaches.", "He thinks he teaches POGIL, but the \"G\" in POGIL method stand for \"Guided\" which he doesn't do. He is lazy. If you go to his office or stay after class to ask him to work out a difficult problem, he doesn't ever do it. If you ask for a way to see the steps, he doesn't give it. When people say he is \"fair\" it's due to his ridiculously huge \"curve.\"", "Prof Johnson is a great professor. He tries to make things as easy as possible. Your grade is distributed evenly through exams and homework. He has to work on the pace of his lectures a little, he started out slow and easy, then speeded up a lot at the end when things got more difficult. But it was an easy, enjoyable course overall.", "He is a good professor. Easy to get along with and he doesn't care if you stay for the whole class as long as you take the test at the beginning!", "Absolutely the best! Extremely knowledgeable,helpful,enthusiastic,FUNNY!We're so lucky to have him at Napa J.C.The classes are interesting ,and its knowledge you'll keep and use for life!", "One of the most knowledgeable and caring professors ever!", "Want to take this course? Think again! Professor Lank does not hesitate to give out 30%, or 4 out of 10 grades in exams and assignments, even in group assignments. Do not think you cannot fail because it is business course.", "He is very educated and concise. He challanges his student and pushes the line of reasoning and critical thinking. He is fun and makes his content relate to his own life experiences.", "Don Hood is a very good instructor. Do not let him intimidate you, it's only for show. He is extremely helpful; but be aware he will not just give you answers!", "Frank is an awesome teacher! I love the way he speaks and lectures. He makes classes fun and enjoyable. He will turn the book that is filled with definitions to concepts that are easy to understand. I highly recommend him.", "Dr. Kent's class is tough, but his willingness to help makes a good grade possible. However, because he is so passionate about what he teaches, he is extremely thorough. As long as you don't mind putting in the hard work, Kent is a great teacher. He truly cares about the success of his students. I had him for A&P1 L and taking him again for A&P 2.", "Absolutely no structure to the class making it extremely difficult to know when or what to study. Must buy text book written by him and filled with spelling errors, excessive rambling and organized poorly. Do not recommend.", "Everything you hear is absolutely TRUE. Very bad teacher and full of himself.", "No Comments", "As someone who has awful ADD and no interest in movies, I still looked forward to coming to Todd's class every day. The material is easy enough to grasp, although he tests directly on readings that are never discussed in class. Still, Todd is always good for a few laughs.", "hes cool. act like you want to learn something and you probably will. test are online and he will help you through his project if you ask. class can be slow but again participate and all is good.", "One of the best professors I have ever had.", "I had him for pre-calc. He's a totally awsome teacher and everyone should take his class.", "Prof. Nielson is way awesome. His class is easy, and he's always willing to help you. He's so lenient when it comes to grades and when you turn things in, it's awesome.", "He is not my favorite instructor--but he isn't bad. He really knows his history! It is not an easy class. If you work hard, though, his class can be quite rewarding.", "The class material is very interesting and he is extremely knowledgeable. Although his teaching style is a little boring, you learn a LOT!", "Enthusiastic, helpful encouraging, tough but fair", "Hey, those who left a \"poor quality\" on Anz-Meador, seriously, if you want to become an engineer, you have to know your physics down to your brain. 1 hour in class you spend, spend atleast 4-5 hours extra. Those engineers who leave a poor quality in this professor it's obvious that you don't study", "Tulovsky is the man!!!!", "Is there to give u A+", "Dr. Curra is a great person. He really knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, he will lecture from the start to the end of class without taking a break. There is so much information, and a lot of it is unclear. His tests are extremely hard. Don't take him if you are looking for an easy A.", "By far the best professor I have had. YES-there is a lot of work and YES the class is hard. But he goes above and beyond trying to do what he can to help his students understand. He gives lots of extra credit and help. He has a great way of relating to his students. He is passionate about what he does and his work reflects that.", "Mr Daniels is a very nice man. He uses all of his time wisely and if you attend class regularly you won't be surprised by the different quizzes he assigns. He has an outline for every unit test. One thing to know is that there are things on the test that are not on the outline. You nerd the book to do really well on the tests.", "Very good at teaching and making you practice.", "Hes alright but the hype is really unjustified. His rating should be around 3.0. Lectures are out of the book and homework problems are obviously way different than the generic book examples. Weekly quizzes on the unit circle got old after awhile when one little mistake could cause a 60%. Not a bad guy though", "As one commernter put it: run from this professor, not walk. He is extremely unhelpful. When asked to clarify he becomes beligerent. Puts it back off on you as if you are stupid. Unwilling to go out of his way to help you the student. Be prepared to read and basically teach yourself the material.", "I didnt learn anything about math, other then how to get frustrated, unmotivated,and just sad!! Getting good GPA is imporntan to me, and this class totally killed it!! Not all teachers fault, but I felt like I was board, and very frustrated with Gilles. I felt he looked down on the math beginers people who didnt have a or first timers in college", "Don't take this class if it's to fulfill the requirement. Instead come to class with an open mind and make the most out of it. Don't miss class, DO the work, ask questions, and you'll be just fine. Really smart dude that actually knows what he's talking about.", "Worst prof at SFU. I totally had a hard time listening to his bordenline-estoteric lectures and bearing with his ego! Luis Paulo Lemos Horta is not a cool prof!", "Brewbaker sucks. Boring, doesn't make sense, smart ass. No good. I'd never ever recommend one of his classes. I love healthcare law and he completely turned me off of it. BOO!", "Tim's a cool professor who cares about his students, -sometimes really hard to reach outside of class. Lectures felt very long sometimes because he tends to talk a lot sometimes, but makes them more interesting with visual aids. There's a lot of reading that we did, but he breaks it up so if you keep up you'll be fine! Looking forward to part 2/2.", "Just like the other guy said, take home tests straight out of the Book in order, no need to attend class, interesting topics discussed in class sometimes.", "He started the class 3 days after the short semester started. He's very unclear with instructions and doesn't respond to emails. He's not involved with the class and the program is what will be teaching you and grading your work. The program is extremely specific in how it wants you to answer homework/exams questions which is extremely frustrating.", "SIMON COWELL", "He's a great teacher! I had lots of fun in his class, he drops your lowest quiz and test. Only one essay is required. His lectures basically cover everything he'll test you on, i barely looked at the textbook all semester. I would most definitely take a psych class with him again", "he is a very tough prof, probably the toughest I have ever had but he is by far my favorite. he is a hard marker for essays and has high expectations, but It makes you a better student. He is great to just chat with about issues in class. Overall amazing guy. Totally possible to get 80+ if you hustle all year.", "Boring professor that creates hard midterm.", "He's a cool guy and pretty laid back. He explains the notes very clearly. He will do anything he can to help. Don't miss class or you will get behind. He gives homework,that can bring you up up a letter grade. He gives somes extra credit. The tests are somewhat hard. If you go over the notes and his study guides they are fine.", "No Comments", "I actually didn't mind him as a teacher. I felt I learned enough to get me through the rest of my SMO classes. The only thing is I feel his marking is sort of, bi-polar.

Lectures were mostly a waste.", "Dr. Wolf is the best teacher I have ever taken. He is eccentric and well educated. He wants people to question the norm.

Showing up to class and doing the readings does seem to be a pre-req to doing well, though.", "Presents material clearly and adds witty remarks appropriately. Would def. recommend.", "Helpful helpful helpful! This is the guy you want if you are fearing math. I was dreading math but Hu tells you on Day 1 that he has study sessions. Saved my tail! It doesn't mean he's easy. It's college math: it's not supposed to be. But in the study sessions he works 1on1 with you til you get it. And he's very funny too! He makes class enjoyable.", "This (online) class is extremely easy to get an A in and still manages to be very interesting as the assignments and textbook are well-written and enjoyable. I encourage you to get as much from the course as you can. Dr Guy is very helpful and fast to respond.", "Spears was an amazing prof! He genuinely cares about the students and tries to remember the names of all of the students in order to develop a more personal relationship.

Highly recomended.", "Nicest man in the world, but wont listen to what you say if you don't have a reliable source. Gets off topic sometimes, but it's because of all the class descussions we have. Only Problem is that he mainly only teaches off of power point.", "PURE HOT GARBAGE", "Ernie is a helluva guy.

Grading appears subjective as there is no rubric, and little constructive feedback on assignments.", "Old tests are available for study. View them! Gives extra credit too. On line quizzes and group labs. Not much math.", "I took this 4wk class online. There is a lot of reading from the textbook and PowerPoint lectures.

Tells good stories and makes great analogies. He's pretty tough.", "He's great.", "Class was interesting. Three quizzes and he gives you a study guide for each. The quizzes are taken DIRECTLY from the study guide. Take good notes and don't miss class and you'll get a good grade. Three papers-the final is one of the papers. Final paper was hard and made you think!! I suggest you start thinking of the paper early!!", "Allen cannot communicate.

As a person he is very helpful , but sometimes he acts like \" I have things more important than you , so hurry up\".", "Great class...patient teacher...class is pretty easy and if your having trouble following the class he is more than willing to assist you, even during test/quizzes. You wont have any regrets taking his class and his accent is not a hindurance in your studies.", "This class is ridiculous. I would NOT recommend. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you want to pass you should probably go. He's interesting to listen to in class but there are only two exams, solely based on stories he tells in class and I learned absolutely nothing about sociology.", "Mr. Clark had to be the best teacher i have had all year. Go to class and you should get an A IN Fundy's and Motor if you go to class and study for the tests its an easy A as well. I learned to Juggle in Fundy's which was the best thing i learned all year!i highly recommend this prof!", "wicked nice guy! his grading was pretty lenient and shows he cares about his students by taking time after class to talk with students and their concerns. however, keep up with the reading because if you fall behind, youre screwed.", "Worst teacher I have ever experienced. He rarely gets off his high horse to actually help students learn his views, which are a must. And if you prefer thinking outside the box, good luck because he doesn't allow it. There were several email threads over the semester with complaints about his attitude and teaching style. Avoid at all costs.", "Horrible textbook that he is writing and emails the sections out as he writes them. He is a horrible teacher. Hard to follow, all over the place, and not clear. DON'T TAKE THIS GUY IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE!", "This guy's passion for Shakespeare only furthered my own. He's completely fascinated by his subject and teaches with a passion. Totally nice guy, tries to do some hands-on stuff which usually turns out funny :) HIGHLY recommended!!!", "No Comments", "In terms of research, he is very cutthroat. He will do anything for grant money to beat out his competitors, even if it means playing unfairly. It's not personal; it's just business. Great professor in Biochem though.", "No Comments", "Nice guy, very high expectations though.", "he's so enthusiastic it's amazing. and he's actually a good teacher who wants you to understand things! great!", "This prof basically teaches a differential equations class, with applications that happen to nominally relate to physics. If you haven't taken Diff eqns, get ready for a ride. Great once you get past the math barrier-but not well presented.", "I enjoyed Dr. Bob a lot since he made his lectures engaging. He also sets up the classroom for you to interact w/other peers. If you need to take this course for credit, I definitely recommend him. Take good notes-it'll be all the material you need on exams. Use notecards, go thru the book, and remember key definitions. He gives bonus!!", "Nice guy, but not sure what he adds to his class. He uses the power points that the book gives to him, and then just reads off it. Sometimes he will use a transparency that he has written on, but his hand writing is completely not legible. His TA grades everything. His mid-term covered 4 of the biggest regions, and he broke it down to 12 questions.", "Professor Cooke cares about the subject and the students, but is extremely disorganized. Overall the lectures are interesting. He is a harsh grader, but curves the grades a lot. The textbooks are completely unnecessary even though he made us buy four of them.", "No Comments", "This is a larger class that feels small because Ted allows students to take control of their own learning. He brings in great speakers from his contacts and the blogs & long-form sector analysis projects are useful to show future employers.", "Dr. Parker is the guy to have for dynamics. He is a very good teacher and the tests aren't that hard. On the tests, if you are on the right track then he will give you most of the points. The only bad thing is the homework... you can expect new homework every class.", "If you are not good at math, and would require the help of a professor with a PLEASANT attidute, who gives a damn whether or not you understand the information, take anything but this class with this guy. Misery loves company.", "This class was brutal! The tests were so unrelated to the lectures and the assignments were all math. He didn't give examples, and classes were a waste of time. He was good at answering his email, but spent way too much time talking about his e-mail list in class too and meetings.", "What a prick", "Dr. C. seems to really love his teaching...took us to the zoo and showed us cool stuff with the bonobos..he was communicating with them! also showed us films and was generally easy to talk with out of class. I definitely would take a class with him again. The final exam was my favorite.", "One of the best classes at Tech. Karthik makes it enjoyable, easy and engrossing. I would definitely take classes from him again.", "Tough grader", "Dr. Stoever is the best professor I've ever had at Western. He is brilliant, interesting, and truly passionate about the subject. I recommend him to everyone. He is, however, very, very tough. Don't take this class if you aren't prepared to read and listen. LOTS. But it's totally worth it.", "I didn't think I would like this class at all, but it turned out to be one of my favorites. He has a good sense of humor and answered any questions clearly. The homework was tough and took a lot of time but doing it made the tests easy.", "Dr. K's class was awesome! I learned a lot about Catholicism. He is a very down to earth guy that understands students. He shares some very interesting stories and real world examples during class.", "This class took up a lot of my time. I got A's in 130/131. You need to utilize office hours but all of his tests are take home and he re-uses them from past years. Find a group that suits you well and you CAN get an A. He offers between 50-100 points extra credit on every exam and the quizzes every Thursday are straight from the notes.", "He talks to fast while your writing down your notes. That means that while you are writing the notes from the boared you are missing out what he is explaining. That means you can not learn anything. I always came out of his class frustrated because I could not get anything what he was saying.", "He is the best professor I ever had! I wish he taught more classes. He is funny,nice and very inspiring. go to class and you'll do good on tests I promise! I learned a LOT in this class. the labs are not hard depends on your instructor, they are very helpful. I never missed one of his classes, if you want to learn, take him! Prof.O is the best!!", "He was an hour late for our final, and I had a plane to catch. A majority of the class left and had to get an N grade until taking the final once spring semester started.\r A lot of the material is on research he's done himself so there's no way of getting around having to know everything. Don't read the book... it won't do you any good. Don't take", "This class was pointless...no more than a book club. Didn't learn a thing. Online blogs were a joke. As a teacher he was good. Not the most patient, gets a little frustrated when his point isn't getting across, but always means well. He cares about your grade and will work with you. Very helpful in office hours. I'd take him in another class.", "Very confusing, boring lectures", "Horrible teacher, expects students to understand everything he's saying; however, he's rude and runs the class way too fast.", "Grades beginning classes with expectations of advanced, very discouraging feedback.", "Overall a good professor. Probably the best that teaches 118. My only complaints are that he moves pretty fast when doing problems on the board, and erases his work from the board pretty fast. He does help students a lot in his office, but he seems to get frustrated easily. Overall good professor though, I would recommend him.", "sometimes you feel like a nut!", "One of my favorite profs. Went off on weird tangents but obviously knew and loved the material.", "He's an awesome teacher who keeps you engaged in conversation. You rarely have homework. Just make sure you go to class.", "I absolutely loved Dr. Talham! He was very clear in his lecturing and made sure to use real world examples to accompany the topic. If you ever have any questions, he is always willing to answer them. In terms of the exams, he was very fair with his exam questions and always willing to discuss them with you after the exam. Great lecturer!", "No Comments", "take someone else. if possible. hes confused. ididnt gt him. hard to understand", "Brilliant, scholarly guy. His seminars are really just lectures with fewer students, but he can be entertaining to listen to and you can learn a lot from him. Had trouble keeping up with what he said sometimes, though. Assigns TONS of reading--don't expect to get it all done. Be prepared for intense conference work.", "Top notch professor - knows his****!!! Ask him anything on entemology and he will have some info about it. Very well respected in the working community by biologists, entomologists, ecologists and the like. Helped me get a job. Now he's retired and doing what he wants.", "Excellent prof and interesting course material. Overall great course.", "Dr. Rorke can be very strict and very demanding on his students. This class teaches you so much-so it is worth it!", "The readings were really interesting and he's obviously a very smart guy. Intimidating at times and after taking numerous English classes, he is most definately the hardest marker that I've encountered..", "All i can say is if you want to learn in this class take someone else.", "Definetly knows his stuff. Go to class even though the same info is in the text. Midterms and Final are hard! Study your butt off!!!! Many people take the class many times. Will help you if you need help. He makes the class interesting with his little stories", "Prof. Walker is the best professor I've had here at IU. He's always willing to help you understand the material, and is committed to student success. Grades tests and returns them within 24 hours. While this class requires good calculus knowledge, he makes all the calculus applications super accessible. I would love to take this course again!", "If you can get to him on a good day he can be kind and helpful, but on a bad day he is rather condescending and makes you feel like a complete idiot. He makes really weird and boarding on inappropriate jokes. His tests are really tough and there is never enough time for examples in class. He is also a very slow grader when it comes to lab reports.", "Most Brilliant mind I have ever met. Went from meeting you at 0 or any other place and took you to 100", "He can't speak good english. Unfair maker! You may not get the grade that you worked hard! Lazy professor!", "great, friendly, organized professor. really enjoyed his class", "Awful professor. He is a very smart man in his field, tells you everything that will be on the exam, but even so the exams are incredibly difficult. Unfortunately, I recommend taking 310 with him so that you can get ready for his style in 410. The t/f questions kill, as do the long problems. Accounting is awful, with him more so.", "He is just a lovely person! Excellent one-on-one so take advantage of office hours. Soft-spoken so you have to really listen but his lectures are always incredibly thorough and interesting. He also seems genuinely interested in what students have to say. His laugh is also the most adorable sound I've heard out of a grown man - highly recommend him!", "Good math teacher; tests are open book, open note; everyone in the class got caught cheating and he just laughed; Russian accent can get hard at times (bunch of kids snickered when he pronounced \"theta,\" \"teeta\"). Just do the homework", "I cannot understand what he is saying. His notes are very messy and his handwriting is horrible. His tests are similar to the homework but he is not good at explaining anything. I had him for Fluids and Dynamics and both times were MISERABLE. Do NOT take him for anything!!!!!!!!!", "Worst prof ever. Class was a lab it had little to do with actual physics. If you followed his instructions perfectly he would still tell you it is wrong and walk away without explaining a bit. Don't take him if you can help it!", "No Comments", "Very easy class. Go and take the quiz each week and then you can leave if you want. I made over 100 on almost ever quiz. You must buy the book for this course, then just study the words for every chapter. The quizzes are not that difficult and if you stay for the whole class you get out atleast an hour or hour and a half early for night classes", "Whatever you do drink an amp or something before class he is sooo boring and very repetitive and it also took us literally two classes to divide into groups but the class is fairly easy all exams are online and open book", "If you are intreseted in history take another class. Spent most of the time talking about essays and very little on actual subject. No structure to lectures, impossible to take notes.", "AMAZING TEACHER! Probably my favorite! He is so good at music and philosophy, and man he is HOT.", "I'm just okay at literature, but this class really helped me. The prof offered lots of comments on my work and plenty of resources. His lectures were smart and funny.", "Dr. Krieglstein is one of the most shameless self-promoters ever encountered. All required texts were authored by him, only one about ethics (<80 pgs). Did film analysis based on the 3 or 4 ethical theories actually covered. Final entailed giving our opinion of his novel (did we like it and why?). Got 100% and feel that I learned nothing.", "Ed is wise beyond his years in the art field. Great guy and a great teacher.", "I'd recommend taking Japanese from Avdulov if you are actually interested in learning the language and are willing to put in the time and effort that requires. His classes are always fun and interesting, and if you work hard you will learn a lot. He's honest, and if you do poorly, he'll let you know.", "I found Dr. Hynes very helpful. He had a thorough knowledge of the course material and wasn't an overly hard marker. He tended to lean towards the philosophical side of 17th C European history which isn't my area of interest but it wasn't too difficult. He could stand to be a bit more exciting but I found him to be a really good prof.", "I think he is an awesome teacher. I had to retake this class after summer 5wk course that was awful. Dr. Frank actually taught me something and was always willing to help. He does not over-complicate things at all. Hands out study guides of what will be on tests and offers extra credit.", "simon knows his stuff, he is more interested in opening students eyes to other forms of architecture, and other approaches to the creative process. the work is demanding, but if you're interested in arch. you'll be excited to try new things. he is also ALWAYS available, and you can call him ANYTIME", "Great teacher, he really knows what he is talking about. He cares about his students success and their future. He just wants everyone to leave the HVAC program knowing what they need to know.", "Professor Catalano is AWESOME. he is really passionate with his teaching and he is definitely not boring! study for the tests, he gives you a review sheet and you will be fine! great teacher i recommend this class 100 percent!", "No Comments", "I've had my share of bad professors at Pace but he's by far the worst prof. He doesn't teach or know how to teach. Whatever his case is, he's a jerk who enjoys seeing the students sweat by constantly putting you on the spot.", "He is super caring and actually wants everyone to pass. Let's you work through the excel assignments as you need to at your own pace. the class is kind of set in a way that the assignments are online and you kinda just sit in class and work on them. He has like little sheets you turn in as proof of doing the work.", "Avoid if at all possible. Class and instructor are a waste of time.", "Doesn't like his teaching style. No power-point straight from the book. Not specific of what he wants in a paper. lectures are long and mundane. Makes you wanna go to sleep! Gets distracted easily.", "Abert is a genuinely nice person and shows enthusiasm. He will only invest in you if he sees that you invest yourself in learning the material. This is math people, you are inevitably going to practice constantly in order to fully grasp what you are learning. The hw problems aren't ever too challenging. If you do the hw the tests should be eazy.", "This was the worst professor I've ever had at GW. Seriously avoid him. He's mean, overly critical to students, and just plain down rude if he doesn't like you. He seriously scared me. He was just that bad of a professor. Take another class because most likely you won't get an A or even a B in his class.", "If you can follow his classes you will remember them forever.Yes, he does diverge, but most of the important features of the discussion come through understanding these. One sided? His view IS the other side and he DOES explain both, not liberal, just practical.He does not force feed you things,and his views of the school ARE OBVIOUS OBERVATIONS", "Very nice and helpful. Easy class for someone who knows a little hebrew!", "Great professor. Very interesting and smart. Had a great time in his class. Never boring.", "This class is SO BORING. I have never had such a boring class. He doesn't talk about anything to do with the text. I did not know it was possible to talk 3 hours about ABSOLUTLY NOTHING. Easy A if you do the homework, just don't expect any reading to be covered in class!", "No Comments", "No Comments", "I dont know why people are giving such a high rating, I absolutely couldn't stand his teaching. I get he's trying to make it fun.. but w/e. You have to stick to reading the book. it's a must and so is attendance. Quizzes are easy if you read and extra credit is easy by showing up for star gazing.", "Professor Fair is one of the best at the law school. If you want to learn the law, you have got to meet this guy!", "Paul is very very very good at what he does. Very open and responsive to students. He was our dept. chair for 12 years, helped erect 2 multi-million dollar music buildings. And we love his Bill Cosby sweaters.", "Professor Loparo is a really cool guy. Gives out extra credits when Indians won and going to class before holidays. The class material is hard but if you do the assigned homework, you will be fine. Quizzes are easy as long as you do the homework. Final is kind of hard but he curves.", "Wonderful professor. Class will be difficult if you don't read. (alot of reading is required). You will be amazed by him. He is so animated and is a wealth of knowledge. Course uses 3 books (he has on reserve at library if you dont want to buy them. At end of semester you do murder profile.

He is such a good person and makes every class fun- I hate missing his lectures. If you can, take a class with him and get to know him, you won't regret it.", "Horrible, Rude, arrogant, scum professor. i wouldnt recommend him for anything .", "One of the worst professors I've ever had. The guy is in love with himself. Home assignments are excessive. Lectures are filled with misinformation. The man is arrogant. Avoid if possible.", "My advice, meticulously read every letter of his assignment twice to make sure you don't miss anything. He'll give you a zero if you do. Otherwise, very knowledgeable and interesting. Has a dry humor and can be pretty stoic. He scares me sometimes. Would still take again though.", "He doesn't give enough time to write down the slides but refuses to put them up on blackboard b/c of he's \"not sure of copyright laws\".. he makes things so much more complex than they need to be, and his combover distracts the whole class. Read the book and u'll do fine.", "I had this professor years ago for English 49B and one of the theater arts film classes. He was the best! His film noir class was so much fun, and I still remember it fondly almost ten years later because now I'm a huge TCM classic film fan. His classes were easy As and he allowed us to do revisions on papers.", "good teach", "Stop giving your own opinion on every single topic and let the class interact every once in a while.", "2 tests, 4 programming projects, and 1 Final. TestsFinal are open-noteslaptop. Directions are 100% clear. Projects are essentially passfail, with some credit for code design. Put in the work and its an easy A, dont and you wont do well. Awkward professor, but knows cryptography very well. Would recommend as long as you are willing to work hard.", "Even though Prof. McAuliffe means well he deals with the subject matter in an uninteresting way.

Furthermore, he is often irrational when discussing the texts and acts dogmatically when you prompt him on these interpretat", "No Comments", "He is picky, but his class his fun and interesting.", "I'm still unsure whether it was the prof or the curriculum, but this class was pretty disappointing. We talked in circles, rarely made references to the assigned readings, were expected to do LONG writing assignments with little lead time, and the semester project was frustrating. You'll have to push yourself to get something from this course.", "Come on, people! He's agreat professor! He comments about how he can't believe they pay him to teach a subject he loves so much. He isn't easy, but he is certianly fair.", "No Comments", "Smartest Professor in Architecture department, very humble not easy but take as many classes with him as possible", "Kurt is a great guy. Most 3030 labs will be in the optics room and will take some time to complete. It's best not to procrastinate in case you have questions (he has office hours, but welcomes walk-ins). Book is a must and you have to have high discipline. Hard grader, but he is just giving an honest rating of how much you really understand.", "he is a great professor and seems very cool", "Too Easy! Just copy his notes word for word as he repeats each sentence like 3 times. It's as if he gives you the exams! It's mostly straight out of these notes that he uses every semester. There's a short presentation along with a 5 page paper. Easy A.", "Sorta Feel like his main goal is too make me fail, but he tricks you because he has a great personality but doesn't leave enough time to take notes.", "Professor Burk is the best math teacher i've ever had. He loves what he does and makes sure everyone understands what he is teaching. He is always willing to help and is truly such a nice guy.I would recommend taking his business calculus class!

He can be very rude and does not give of his time to students.", "He's a great teacher, and his classes are fun you just have to pay close attention, and you'll never get by if you don't go to class.", "He speaks very monotone and does not keep students engaged by any means. Thus, it is very hard to stay awake and the way he presents material makes it difficult to remember. This makes the exams incredibly difficult. The exams are also random and unrelated to in-class information. Fisher is also very wishy-washy when it comes to class policies.", "He is probably one of the most picky professors I have ever met. His grading is very inconsistent. For one speech, I used a visual aid in a way he liked. For the next speech, I did it in the same way and for some reason he did not like it and gave me a lower grade. Also, he'll tell you something is ok, but then later he'll he'll you it is not.", "He makes the material seem like a piece of cake.", "Prof. Erdelyi's class was horrible! Not only did I get NOTHING out of his class, but it was the first class I got a C in! I've always received a B or an A in a psyc class! He gets off topic in a heartbeat, so you end up LOST! Hes so DISORGANIZED, some people should not be allowed to teach! PLEASE do not take him, or you'll regret it as I have now!", "No Comments", "Definitely works students hard.

Very nice and helpful. His grading scale is very generous. Easy A.", "There is a lot of extra credit and he is very fair in the grading criteria. He is super sweet. If you show up to every class, you get four points on your final average. Would take him again!", "Took this course as an honors class.

He mainly just takes questions from hw and lecture notes and just changes them a bit. So if you understand the concept your fine. It is important that you come to his classes on time.", "Lectures can get a bit boring, but he adds in really amusing stories about his life to help lighten things up. Minimal homework; super short, easy essays due every week on Canvas and a final exam. Lots of extra credit opportunities.", "Really nice guy who wants to be helpful and engaging - but isn't always successful. It was massive class, he crammed way too much information, with no tutorials or assignments to help you along halfway. The grade is split between the midterm and final exams. Overall, a frustrating class, disappointing considering the topics are very interesting", "Tests are open book so I mean that is helpful, but the material sucks and aside the fact he can't keep on the topic at hand for long or he does for TOO LONG. Sucks when he wrote the textbook so he thinks that he knows all.", "Paul was amazing. He was so helpful in and out of class. I learned so much in his class because we talked about EVERYTHING.

Was a grad student at the time and loaded coursework down on us like crazy! Very unclear and very tough grader! Spent my whole summer reading very difficult books. :(", "Nice guy but a tough teacher. All classes are straight lecture so be ready to take notes. For tests he gives you 40 terms and 5 essays, he picks a portion of them on test day.

Even then, take with caution.", "fun teacher and awesome class! verdammt!", "I took his honors class. He obviously thinks highly of himself and I disagreed with the biased point of view he taught.

(Could use the books/notes on them for accuracy..but still needed to know the info prior or you'd be out of luck).", "This legend was the highlight of my first semester. He's loud, funny, and likes to pick on his students out of mutual fun. He literally says what's going to be on the tests. This class was extremely easy, just occasionally review; I crammed the exams and still got A's on all of them. Dr. Frazier is just too boring, just avoid her.", "An awesome prof who knows his stuff. I highly recommend him.", "Its very clear that he's knowledgeable about the subject but he's terrible at conveying that knowledge to his students.

Sometimes people just don't understand.", "Cares about students", "Was pretty psyched to take a class on comics, and although the material was cool and interesting, the experience overall was destroyed by the prof's arrogance. He needs to turn down the bravado big time, and come down to earth with the rest of us--he is such a turn off OMG!", "Everyone was telling me how hard intermediate micro is, but it really isn't too bad if you go to class. Prof Walker only tests on the material he teaches in class and assigns in homework. Just go, take good notes, and study a tiny bit and youll be fine.

Useless information.", "He specifically sets up the assignments to make everyon arrive in class having done the readings, and to help people keep up and do well.

He encourages discussion, and coming to his office.", "Great tutor. Works well with students!", "Pretty good teacher, his voice is so relaxing. He is not the easiest grader though. Class is cancelled and you get out early a lot.", "Mr. Hu is a very nice guy, but he's also one of the most difficult math professors I've ever had. I struggled to earn a C, but Hu is very well organized and you can learn a lot from his lectures. Not recommended for the faint of heart but if you identify as a math geek and like a challenge then this is the guy for you.", "Failed a quarter of his class.", "Rob is probably the best professor ever. He is very laid back and his classes are so enjoyable. I've loved every single class I have taken with him.", "No Comments", "Very clear and helpful but a REALLY tough grader", "Very passionaite and understanding teacher! Extemely fair!", "He is a great prof. but he tends to forget that his students are not on the same level he is when he is explaining the material. He does have a personality so the class is boring. His test are easy b/c the questions come directly from ex. in the book. he does not explain the material too well when u ask ?'s he keeps moving leaving you very confused", "No Comments", "Midterm, Final, & Paper. Paper is extremely easy, emphasize the extremely. Midterm & final are both open notebook & book. Come to class & write down EVERYTHING he says. Highlightunderline the ones that he says will be on the test. Print out the class lecture notes instead of copying it from the screen. Stay for the movies, q's will be on tests!", "Great Visual Basic instructor. Class was informative and enjoyable. Would take a course from him again.", "He can't teach. The first 3 times I was there, I realized that he only talks about his life and that's it. Then the 4 other times I was there was to find out when we will take the exam. Uh, well we were very behind so he gave everyone a 90 on the second exam, dropping the lowest grade of the two. Easy A, but you won't learn a thing. Just stay away.", "Hardest undergrad class I've had in my ec major. Exams are really hard. Would probably be easier if he gave you the tools you need. Your studying tools are 1 to 2 examples of the question which he will change drastically. You need to memorize the textbook, his slides, his lectures and google all the info he doesn't give you if you want an A. Avoid.", "He is the best professor I had so far! His lectures are very interesting and just read the book and you'll pass his class!!!! Very funny guy and he is very passionate and knows his stuff!!!", "Not too bad", "I hated this guy!", "truthfully I took classes in DMIT expecting to receive a scholarly perspective, I dont think he even has a degree; as a group we learned the same as watching a Youtube video presented by a 12 yr old.", "excellent", "Great Professor, very funny and interesting. The class grade is based on only 3 exams. He curves everything. Going to class and taking notes is very helpful.", "A pretty dorky teacher, but super nice. His lectures are interesting, however I suggest focusing on the book for tests, quizzes, etc. Open note quizzes and exams. The journal question are rather difficult and can become overwhelming. Overall great teacher + easy class!", "I've just finished his class. It was difficult but very interesting. His personality is fantastic. He seems to love what he is doing.", "great prof, too bad he got promoted and is gone!", "Great Class, Loads of Information So get organized! Lots of Formulas so brush up on some algebra... Just do your work on time & attend every class. Feel free atr ask for help, Zentz prefers people to get help ahead of time, out of class. You will learn alot in this course so dont get behind. Good Luck", "Brilliant. A deep thinker and a poet. I was honoured to have studied with him.", "You have no choice if you want to be an EM major... you HAVE to have him as your teacher two times. Either switch majors or suck it up. Yeah, he gives entirely too much busy work... but it's easy. You just have to memorize slides/in class work for tests. Just do what he says & you'll be fine.", "Damen is an excellent professor. Very excited about what he teaches. You will have to write several papers but they are short and he is an easy grader. He delves into lots of really interesting stuff in his lectures. Great class. I would recommend it to anyone", "terrible teacher...does not teach at all, needs to retire!", "Jerome Taylor is the worst teacher I have ever had for the following reasons: 1. he comes ten minutes late to every class, 2. he talks in a incomprehensible monotone voice so its impossible to stay awake in class, 3.he is extremely disorganized, 4. he missed the final, forcing us to take an incomplete grade & take the final next semester.DONT TAKE", "Loved the class and gained a wealth of knowledge. Sad that there aren't more professors on this campus like him.", "Not sure why Ian gets such a bad rep. He is not a super interesting prof but just show up to class and do other class work while you're there. You don't need to pay attention if you read the textbook instead. 3 non-cumulative midterms and a final project (3 questions answered in essay form).", "Doctor Kelly is extremely genuine and smart. If you have a good base in chemistry and read the materials before classes, you could understand all of his lectures and average in the B or A range at the end of the year. His exams similar to previous exams (secretly shared by students) and he always gives feedback in afterhours. strongly recommend", "If you try, you'll get a good grade. Hirschl hates economics and spends most of the time explaining his own views and supporting himself with questionable evidence. Whenever he uses scientific evidence as support, he looks foolish to the science majors. All correct answers on exams are variations of: \"Whites & men are oppressing blacks & women.\"", "Be prepared to work; It was a pretty good class though.", "Unno was the leader of my fig and he made it quite interesting. While the lectures seemed long sometimes, he was able to mix music such as Miles Davis with philosophy and make it totally mindboggling. Unno KNOWS how to give a good thoughtout speech.", "Real nice guy, but couldn't teach if his life depended on it. I agree with the previous post, that he is a really lazy teacher. He does not teach the class and makes student teach the class. You would think why you pay for the class if your only teaching yourself. His test are extremely hard. NOT recommended at all.", "He needs to learn how to watch his mouth and teach so students understand.", "Tarkow is hilarous and tells jokes that are actually funny. Extremely personable. His summaries of myths are incredibly good, and he knows a crazy amount. The tests are fairly easy if you are willing to study. I highly suggest his classes.", "Clear lectures and notes. If you cover the review sheets that he GIVES you, you will do fine. Very helpful and great explainer. Would take him again.", "Such an amazing teacher. If I could take that class again, I would in a heart beat!", "Bill is one of the coolest teachers ever. He helped me find freelance work while I was still going to school. I've used many of the things he taught me on my last game title Advent Rising, and techniques I'm currently using on King Kong here at Weta Digi", "Outstanding professor. He truly cares about the students and really makes the class interesting. The assignments are fairly graded and make you think about the material in an interesting manner. I would highly recommend one of his classes to anyone.", "I've taken both of his film classes and he really knows about the genres and films he is talking about. ALSO, if you plan on not coming to class and have no interest in film don't take this class. Why would you not want to come to a class where you watch just watch films? The essays are not even hard because he lays out the parts that he expects..", "I would recommend him. Expect homework but it's very manageable. If you do the work you should be able to easily pass. He is upfront about what quizzes are over and midtermsfinal.", "enthusiastic!!", "Knows a great deal about his subjects, but seems to expect the students to know as much as himself. Not very sympathetic or helpful. Don't EVER let your cell phone go off in class either. He goes crazy!", "easy class,nice guy. Study the powerpoint slides-memorize them! thats where his ?'s 4 tests will come from.class can be boring,but u can use the computer throughout class & get other things done. No HW, just in class grp projects & 1 group presentatio", "He is fascinated by what he teaches and it actually inspired me to learn - not many teachers can do that. He really cares about his students. Asks us questions to make sure he is teaching the subject well enough. One of my favourite professors.", "Craig loves photography and loves to teach it. He gives out weekly assignments, but they're typically easy. He's always a joy in class and teaches tips and tricks in photoshop that most people didn't know. He's been using photoshop since version 1. Take digital imaging from him, he's much more experienced than others teaching it.", "an excellent teacher and intellegent man.", "Dr. Stecker might be the best philosopher on campus. But note that that doesn't entail he has the best pedagogy. I recommend visiting him during office hours. He'll give feedback on papers, and he's often willing to have discussions. He seems to want his students to be the best philosophers they can be.", "very boring", "Very reading intensive. Tim's an easy grader, lots of quizzes and three major papers. Attendance is part of your grade. We read a novel a week, which makes it easy to fall behind. At least the books are interesting.", "Makes alot of jokes, talks about his past work quite a bit, and makes what could be a blah subject, pretty fun and finds ways to get things to stick into your mind. Overall a pretty great teacher, and you can talk to him about anything. theres always someone who blurts out random things in class", "Took his land development class S-11. Great class and well taught. Anyone who is even remotely interested in business ventures and development can learn a ton! He really has a vast education and you can see a lot of his studies come out in this class. Really helped me out as the class/projects progressed. Overall very interesting class and teacher", "I took a summer class with him once and it was fun. We had a lot of outdoor activities, like going to Yellow Creek. Not a hard class, and he's a fun guy (likes talking about diseases a lot). If you can take your intro course with him do it.", "The lecture is hard, unclear.", "I really like this professor. He's one of the best math teachers at Parkland. He teaches \"with\" students and not \"down\" to them and always encourages questions and tries to answer them the best he can. Very pleasant guy to be around and I've found his grading to be very fair. Diff EQ is a tough class, but he wants you to succeed.", "This professor is the best I have seen yet. He cares so much about you passing the class, that he will stop teaching just to make sure you get the problem correct. He makes mathematics simple and fun. There is no way you can leave this class confused or angry. He ALWAYS puts a smile on your face. Professors should learn his style of teaching.", "Hes very rude and talks nonsense to the whole class. He gives out answers but changes the subject too much. I feel like I am not getting the proper learning I should be getting. Hes worse by far. I dont understand how hes an easy class of does not teach but talk useless information. I am trying to get a career here.", "Ethics is a good class to take if you need an easy humanities credit. I thought my papers sucked but I guess in ethics your opinion could be right so he gives you the A. My midterm I thought I bombed but because I rebuttled some of the questions I got the A too. What a good teacher!", "HE ROCKS!! Bob really takes the stress out of learning math! He's focused on not making things hard for you so that you can get to Math 118 as quickly as possible. You get to keep the test questions so that if you fail he calls you with what you got wrong and you just bring your answers in. I wish he taught everything!", "No Comments", "He goes really fast- but you learn alot", "No Comments", "Do not take Sharif for Dynamics, or anything for that matter. He stands up at the front working examples, with horrible handwriting, and speaks incomprehensibly. To make it worse, he uses online tests and quizzes with ridiculously low tolerances, and made us write down work but didn't give partial credit for it, would just TAKE OFF points...", "He's such a sweet guy and seems genuinely crushed that no one comes to his lectures. Attending recitation and getting good grades on exams is all you really need; it's a pretty easy course.If you have a heart, go to his lectures on occasion. He's a sweet old man; no one wants to know they're boring.", "this teacher is easy as balls. he will give you a C just for signing up. I think i had like 2 assignments the whole semester, and even if you don't do them and you show up, you'll get a B", "No Comments", "Dr. Beneski was by far the worst professor I have ever had. He was impatient, cocky, and he was not very good at explaining the material. Most students have to retake his courses and he is proud of it. I strongly suggest you steer clear of this professor.", "Actually the worst professor I've had at Cornell -- I don't care if he is a brilliant researcher. He had no investment in the class, terrible lectures and had no care whatsoever what students took away from his class - truly terrible.", "Go to class, random quizzes for attendances. class is grades by points. No phones. Follow his rules and you will be fine. DONT buy the textbook. His notes are online. test are the notes. He uses clickers. He sends emails thing that you need to read (print them out/fill them out/take to class, they might be for extra credit)", "I lasted two days in Roter's Ear Training 3 before I switched. Not only was he extremely unclear, but he also made me feel very uncomfortable when I asked if I could test out of his class. Depending on the mind you have, ear training is either very easy or very difficult. He hates students with absolute pitch, but many others fail his class.", "This class is an easy A IF you do well on the lecture exams which can be sort of difficult if you dont study. I showed up to lecture & sat on my phone the whole time but you have to show up for iclicker points. However, you only need to end up with 70% clicker to get 100% so you can miss a good amount. Labs are easy and exams are easy if you study", "I usually don't listen to what people say on this thing... but what they say about him is right! Everytime I think about this \"teacher\" I get a weird headache and I feel depressed or angry I don't even now. No Joke. Try your best to switch out.", "Professor Reed is a really cool dude. He really isn't as intimidating as you think. The class is based off of 3 tests that are essays. That may seem hard but it really isn't that bad (especially if you attend the TA sessions). I was an hour and a half late to our final and Reed let me take it with the full time in the testing center BLESSED.", "No Comments", "unclear,very boring, useless class", "Great porofessor,makes class interesting.

He's great, makes class fun.", "Very clear on his expectations, but not overly nice.", "Not an easy class, but if you go everyday and take notes then you will do just fine. Caporale is excited about the subject, but he doesn't really make it any more interesting for the students.", "Dr. Critelli is an AMAZING Professor! He makes you think outside of the box and challenges you to be out of your comfort zone. There's a reason he says things so don't think he's entertaining you. Take good notes and read the text to do well in the class. Make sure to go to his office hours, he will help you out! I wish he taught more classes.", "Do ALL the work. To get an A it is ESSENTIAL you understand the material. It is not simply knowledge based, but application. This class is basically using COMMON SENSE/LOGIC to see if an argument is bad or good. It will be HARD if you don't understand the material. if you actually pay attention and understand it, it is EASY. Extra Credit Possible.", "Dr. Rawdon is easily one of the best profs at Duquesne. He takes a class that could be very monotonous and makes it fun. He moves very quickly, but he's always willing to slow down and help if you need it. His combination of humor and serious teaching makes the class fly by and before you know it, you understand Calc. Pretty amazing.", "A bit confusing", "He is a very nice guy, and he makes lectures interesting with video clips and jokes. Only a midterm and a final..unless you get an awful TA you should be fine in this class. He posts all the lecture notes online in case you miss a class", "Does an outstading job only testing you on what you should have learned, labs are quite easy and lectures are very well paced.", "I felt so discouraged after this class!! I always thought when things are a myth there is no right or wrong answer, sorry but to him there is only his RIGHT!!", "A lot of effort is needed to pass his class.", "No Comments", "The best earth science teacher at Brock! He really challenges you to think. A lot of readings in his courses but you come out having learned a great deal.", "Dennis is nice and means well, but is iffy as actor and director. He does teach you some things, but he has very jaded opinions that he presents as gospel (so you kind of have to predict those weird opinions and make theatre that fits them by sheer luck to get support in class). He's out of touch with the field which is his biggest problem.", "No Comments", "very nice man, although the lecture is some what boring however he explains very well; easy to understand his lectures and he's been very helpful; best prof i've seen @ UW", "No Comments", "..... and not only that, his instructions in his lab manual are horrible. Not much clarity, and you basically have to figure out on your own and out of the blue how to solve some of the post-labs. Absolutely ridiculous. His exams have the most random questions, A LOT of which is not even study'able from his notes. Confusing and unclear questions.", "No Comments", "Great professor, if you do the work and post on the discussion boards you will do just fine! He outlines clearly what is expected in papers and if you follow what he tells you to do not only will you get good grades but the papers are easy to write.", "I took him for a summer course, and found out that the man is indeed crazy. Will reach into kiln and grab pieces without gloves. Steve is like an encyclopedia though, he knows more than what he can say.", "Everyone seems to give him good ratings, but in my experience he hasn't been especially helpful or clear. He obviously knows what he's talking about but moves too quickly and seems to be bored/annoyed at teaching such a large class. If you work hard in his class you'll do well, but don't expect him to be as awesome as everyone says he is.", "Simply horrible. If you DON'T WANT TO LEARN A WORD, TAKE HIM.", "His lectures are so long and the lecture notes that he reads off of are filled with too much information that we shouldn't even need to know. He doesn't clearly specify what to know on exams and his exams have too many true and false questions which throw us all off. He's a professor with a lot of knowledge but he should change some things.", "He kind of trails off when he talks, not that a lot of what he says is important to take down. Gave us his powerpoints and the tests were open book/note, but you had to voice your opinion on those as well. Just go on about how important children are to you.", "Not a good grader. Makes a lot of mistakes in grading. Powerpoints are boring. Tests are tough, you must study power points. Other than that it's not a bad class. Just keep on top of how he's grading you.", "Dr. Ryan is a great professor, he is a really easy guy to get along with and talk to. the material in this class was boring, but he tried to make the best of it. I will def. take him for future classes", "This class will take over your life. The prof is extremely egotistical and thinks he is the best thing since sliced bread - he isn't. No written feedback until the midterms/exams. If this course is a requirement for you, I'd recommend trying to get another prof. Or get well acquainted with Khan Academy and be prepared to self teach!", "Don is very much what you will find in the industry. Very much ego driven. If you aren't in his click, you'll know it. I believe Don is a good teacher. But, what he taught was sometimes wrong and overall, didn't cover what I needed to enter into the real world of production. If you can conquer Don, you'll do well in the industry.", "Awesome prof! He's funny and fun to watch", "No Comments", "awesome!! made lectures interesting and fun.. always got out of class early and offers lots of extra credit", "Dr. Fisher was awesome, he says the funniest corny jokes during class. He keeps his lectures interesting. Records all lectures on tegrity, but you have to come to class in order to get the clicker points. Tests were not difficult for me but were difficult for classmates. Class averages on exams were usually in the low 70s. Final exam was easy", "Murphy always talks about football and never mentions anything about biology. He has confusing lectures but I will admit that his powerpoint short video presentations are ok. His test are very hard and if you play football he will pass you reguardless so unless your an athlete I dont reccomend this class.", "avoid", "He seems nice and outgoing. There were quizzes almost every day. The final was hard and it required remembering EVERYTHING.", "He's smart and he's funny. It sounds like his undergraduates don't like him, but we have a pretty good time in the grad class. He'll legitimately care about your interpretation and he'll make you think.", "A nice instructor. Very easy on grades/Assignments and makes his class interactive and interesting.", "Tompkins is a very good teacher who cares about you UNDERSTANDING not memorizing the material. His youtube videos are extremely helpful, but his tests and quizzes are extremely challenging and quite difficult. He does not care about your grade and makes it nearly impossible to get an \"A\" in his class. Too much information to learn for a 4 week clas", "really fun teacher! Takes things a lot more seriously than you'd guess, but it's only because he cares.", "It was a very enriching experience. It was difficult but the study guides were very helpful.", "Do not take this class if you want to keep your sanity. He is extremely hard on tests. On the day of the final you have your 3rd exam, plus cumulitive final which encompasses roughly 15 chapters. Stay away.", "Interesting! I wasn't sure I would pass at first because his style of teaching is a lot different. But as long as you read the chapters and go to class you will pass. His lectures are awesome. You will learn a lot about life. Brilliant man!", "I've never heard of having to do papers in a math class but we have almost weekly papers on concepts he hasn't even taught yet", "Took his online course. Worst experience so far in university (3rd year). Offers no help, and doesnt provide proper info on anything. First assignment was the most vague piece of $#!$ everyone I showed as ever seen. Shame on York for hiring him to educate the new was of statisticians and business people.", "Very hard .long tests ,too many in class assignments and home assignments .not recommended", "Professor Ballantyne was a great first speech teacher to have. Class was mostly lecture preparing you for speeches, then giving speeches, and there were 4 tests for the semester on lecture and the book. Since class was all lecture it was not fun, but is speech class fun? No. You have to show up, pay attention, and try hard and your best on speechs", "steve is one of my favourite teachers", "If you're into bio this is the guy for you. His lectures are a bit dry but he is really enthused about what he teaches. had him for my first college semester and he's one of the best.", "My only complaint- I wish he'd speak more in Spanish only during class.", "Boring. Too much reading for an engineering course", "Nice guy, loves weather... gets very excited about it. not a bad teacher at all.", "make sure to do the story ideas. Do your beats as well. Buy the required book, most of the coursework is AP style. He cancels class to give students more time to work on the assignments."]}}
