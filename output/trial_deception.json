And uh we're just not prepared to make any assertions as to uh what the outcome is going to be until it's a full and thorough investigation.", "There was a lot of talk about me being, you know, seduced by Jodi. And frankly, Jodi is not that seductive as a person. She's pretty straightforward, uhm, and what Jodi did was terrible. But Jodi isn't terrible. And I think the media...

And uh, he was being very aggressive with the officers, we didn't understand why. We just needed everybody to follow orders, we just wanted everybody's safety. I mean we just have to give the orders to step down to the street.", "No, no. I did not and I had absolutely nothing to do with her disappearance. And I'm glad that she did. I did. I did. Um and then when Laci disappeared, um, I called her immediately. It wasn't immediately, it was a couple of days after Laci's disappearance that I telephoned her  and told her the truth. That I was married, that Laci's disappearance she didn't know about it at that point.  ", "Either a barrel or a stick but certain, they are like, they are going to kill you. I'm at lost at justifing what I did in a second valley other than saying that I thought that they were shooting back. ", "No, not at any time. He called me some names, but that wasn't really a conversation.  It wasn't a two part conversation. ", "Ahhh ... I didn't go to the dance club as a drinking activity, and nor did I know at the time that it was a dance club until we got in there.", "When I sort a came out of the fog, I realized \\oh, crap\\\" something bad had happened and I was scared to call any authority at that point.\"", "He pushed me and I was up in his face. Definitely in his face. Pushed me, I don't know if he did it on purpose but he scratched my neck. And then he scratched my neck. I had a err...a rag t-shirt on anyway because I'd been taking care of my house. And he tore my shirt.", "I want to say, the prosecutor, I can't see her face but I wish I could. You disgust me. The Dorsey family disgusts me. Because how dare you say that happened to my son. You weren't there. Ya'll was never there. You were the absentee people ... always. So the Dorsey family, down to the mother, the father, to everybody- I hope ya'll live your lives well but Imma saying to my child, Gabrielle Blair, you lived well but Imma saying to 'em throughout their whole life. So live well now. You got not nothing else to say to me for I did for my child.

When we got to the hotel, I remember, ammm \u2026  sitting, er \u2026 sitting briefly on the balcony of my room, but then that was that there was no other additional time if that's what you're asking.

I'm not going to say I've never told a lie in my life before this ... incident, but, the lies I have told in this case are can be tied directly back to either protecting Travis' reputation or my involvement in his death, in any way. Because I was very ashamed of the death, and also I wanted to edify Travis in a good way, I didn't want to de- edify him or say hateful things about him, especially now that he had passed away and also I didn't want that to be construed as ... motive, for example if he was violent with me.", "Well, I think that I have a good memory June 4th is an anomaly for me.  It's like I said yesterday, it's in a class of it's own. And I can't explain why, what kind of state of mind I was in, um it was, most of the day was an entire blank, and little pieces have come back, but not very many, So I can't explain that day alone but if you were, to put that day over here and over here all the other days of   memory issues that are any different from any average person.", "... brother, sister and his children...I know that he was a fun loving Uncle and I'm ... can't continue to experience things in his life ... for a kid ... there is certainly no way to explain ... make sense of the situation and I'm truly sorry for that.", "He said he was hungry, get something.

He was standing being that partially opened door Tim talked about, with a gun.", "I was, I believed that it\u2019s not okay in any circumstance to take someones life even if you are defending your own life that\u2019s how I believed it So I never really stopped to consider how society would view it. If someone is defending themselves, I just felt like I had done something wrong and I was afraid of what the consequences would be.", "The lunging and the gun going off were sort of contemporanios, I don\u2019t remember how close they were or if it happened at exactly the same moment or one right after the other, it all happened very fast, and it all seemed to happen all at once, and I would say as far as distance, maybe as far as Mr. Babbikey (sp?) is, (court reporter?) but I couldn\u2019t say for sure with absolute certainty.", "I knew it. Get them kids back there, don\u2019t wanna look at you. I got a gun up here. Get them kids back there. They\u2019ll flail a little bit but get them back there. Where the police, come in and shot the boy where they were gone say they were? \u2026 Well I could\u2019ve, look at all those rounds I had. If I wanted to kill someone, I could have. I weren\u2019t trying to kill nobody. They wasn\u2019t no hostages, young folk scared. You see the man, he made them testify. Them folk going to jail don\u2019t come here and say nothing on me.

Made him do it.", "as far as details, every detail, I just sometimes I have a general sense of what\u2019s going on, and sometimes I don\u2019t but as far as the fog goes, it\u2019s more of again, words that are being spoken, or screamed or yelled, and that what processing that sort of thing, physical things I can remember because I feel them physically, I can remember what I feel internally and emotionally as well, but it\u2019s more the words that are being spoken and their meanings, but I do remember how I feel, if that makes sense.", " Well ... I do know that we struggled that day, and based on logic it would have  because of how we fought . I don't know how things ended up, where they ended up. I just ", "Well, again I can't, it happened so fast I did initially think Run, so I went down the hallway and then right as I got to the hallway, with the doors being shut, it just seemed like more of an obstacle it would give him more time to catch up, to open the door this way and run around it and out, when this door was an equal distance and open. I could run that way and into it. So my thought initially was to run out this door, and then around and out, but I was doing something just to create more distance, because last time I had run that same route and I was not successful in running out of the room.", "My attempt to talk to them was to present a better image of our relationship, and to downplay the negative aspects of it, like \\it's not really a big deal\\\" \\\"oh, it wasn\u2019t that bad\\\" that kinda thing, like \\\"oh, yeah, I knew that he did that, but that wasn't a big deal\\\" um, even our arguments, oh, sure it was rocky, there was turmoil, but we were friends, so my attempt was more to present a good image of Travis, and a good image of myself and that our relationship had it's ups and downs, but we were still um, on good terms.\"", "In a sense that is correct, I remember that. Dropping the knife, screaming and that  memory came much later,   Um, but it goes blank after that. I don't remember putting the gun in the car, I don't  remember putting the rope in the car, but I have, not crystal clear, but pretty, pretty solid  memories of disposing of those. So they did go in the car obviously, but I don\u2019t remember  placing them in the car.

I was kinda getting my bearings, um, so there is, it\u2019s not completely clear, I just remember he had his hands around my neck, and he was banging my head on the carpet. I tried to push him off, and then it was, and then I blacked out. Really shortly after that."]}}
