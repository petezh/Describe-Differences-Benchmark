duty.", "Conscripts are assigned to the reserves and sent home.", "To this point, it has been considered a sound practice because since the 1990s, the Russian armed forces have been considered to have their hands full dealing with internal problems.", "Thus Estonian defence planners assumed that the security environment would deteriorate only gradually, allowing the country\u2019s political and

limited training against Russian special forces who would already have seized and taken up defence of sites of strategic importance.", "If we analyse the dates when conscripts are called up for compulsory military service in 2014 and the number of conscripts, we see that only in the first five months of the year there are significant number of conscripts who would be capable of operating at least on a platoon level.", "The Defence Forces also have a smaller contingent consisting of rapid-response units (above all, the Scouts Battalion and also a special operations unit) manned with active duty personnel.", "In recent years Kaitseliit has increased its membership at a stable pace and as of the end of 2012, the organisation had around 13,200 active members.", "Yet caution should

immediately.", "The events in Crimea show that the latter should be a priority.", "Undoubtedly radical measures should be considered, such as increasing the number of units manned with active duty personnel.", "Another possibility is to extend the duration of conscription so that the units that are trained during compulsory military service are not immediately assigned to the reserves but instead left on active duty for a time.", "This is the option being explored in Norway, where an 18-month term of service is being attempted that would allow conscripts to be used for up to six
