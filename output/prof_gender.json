However, when we tried to do that, it seemed to kind of squish his scrotum. Not like squished to death, but it has red marks from being pressed up against the fabric folds. But then that happens other times too when we don't do the thigh crease--is that a normal thing for boys to have light red marks on the scrotum?

In the morning she has no interest, in the afternoon she'll maybe have one accident, if that, and it's usually on the bathroom floor. I don't quite get the disparity. Does any one else's kid have weird habits like this? Is it maybe because 4 days a week she's at daycare in the morning (until 3 or 4) and she's more comfortable at home? Half the time when I go to pick her up at daycare, though, she is happily on the potty, and her carer tells me she tries really hard all day there. \\n\\nI'm hoping she'll be trained by September, when we're going on vacation. I know I'll have to be prepared for accidents, but it will still be easier. \\n", "We switched my daughter from her infant car seat to a convertible right around Christmas. We also around that time got some new diaper covers. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s one issue or the combination of both, but we\\u2019re getting a ton of blowouts now. She seems to almost exclusively poop in the car seat now, so it\\u2019s hard to troubleshoot, but my feelings is that it\\u2019s the seat leading to the issues. The leaking is around her legs. Please help! I\\u2019m so tired of having to clean up blowouts. \\n\\nWe use thirsties stay dry inserts in a mix of thirsties, bumgenius, and random other brand pockets that we just use as covers (lay insert on top of pocket fabric, not inside.) The blowouts seem to happen in all, maybe a little less frequently in the Thirsties.", "We've tried candy rewards and stickers. We made a big deal about giving her a special present of big girl underpants. I've tried going in with her and letting her be by herself. Nothing is working! She can recognize that she needs to go, but is so stubborn. When I try to bring her to the potty she runs away, and if I bring the portable potty to her she runs away. She just refuses to cooperate. I'm getting so frustrated. I don't know what else to do. ", "For the last little while (probably a month) there's been an impenetrable, hard, chalky build-up in the bottom of his potty.  To get it off you really have to go at it with like a chisel or something, it's ridiculous.  What could this be?  Is it something in his urine collecting on the plastic?  I wash it out thoroughly at least once a day (after he poops) but sometimes he'll pee on his own and I won't notice for a couple hours so there is sometimes pee sitting in the bowl for a while before I rinse it out.  But even washing with a cloth every day doesn't get it off, it's HARD and really stuck on there unless it flakes off.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell he has no UTI or anything, his pee isn't cloudy so I have no idea what could be causing this.", "My son did not like the way poop felt in his diaper, so he climbed right up and poop trained himself. That was almost a year ago but he is still peeing in his diaper, or on the floor. I ask him if he has to pee and he says \"no thanks\" every time but one. I can get him to go sometimes, other times I get a huge fit. No pee, pee underwear or pull up a minute later. I guess my question is, if he poo trained himself, will he pee train himself when he is ready? I have been trying since he poo trained himself. And it's been a very long time.", "My 2.75 year old is working on using the potty, and I need to know where to go from here. When we're at home, she generally runs around pants less, and uses her potty pretty well, both for poop and pee. But if we're out wearing underwear, she gets distracted and won't tell me if she has to go, plus she doesn't like using the big toilets, either at home or in public. How do I get her to use the big potties, and how do I get her to understand that underwear aren't like diapers?", "My daughter is potty trained and we rarely have accidents during the day.  For about 4 months, she was good about waking up to call daddy to take her potty.  But in the past 2 months, she has stopped taking afternoon naps and has started wetting the bed.\\n\\nI take her potty, then put her to bed then wake her up 1 hr  later but usually it is too late.  It has been as short as 20 minutes to the bed wetting.\\n\\nAny tips on how I can correct this?", "been low level potty training for ages, he sits and does a pee when prompted but either likes being wet/dirty or still can't tell when he needs to go. \\nHe hates having his nappy changed, but still seems resistant to pooping on the potty. Tried rewards but he just kept lying that he needed to go to get the prize. Had him nappy free a lot in summer but it was too early. Had a new baby in September which I think increased his resistance to being a \"big boy\". My partner is not remotely conscientious about this sort of thing so approaches where we both need to be fully on his case all day ain't gonna work either as I have a young baby and can't be everywhere. \\nI'm hoping when he goes up a class at nursery peer pressure will kick in. In 90% sure he is resistant and could do it if he wanted.....\\nAny tips welcome!\\n", "We're thinking ahead a few months to potty training, and wondering what everyone is using - along with the positives and negatives of each. What does everyone think?", "Hi all. My 26 month old daughter was showing serious interest in the potty, getting fussy about wearing wet diapers, and would have dry diapers sometimes after 2 hours. I thought she was ready, and we've had some hits in the potty, but she is going sooo often - this morning she had 7 pees in an hour and a half after breakfast. Two were big, the rest were small.  I am guessing this means I need to wait, but I just want to make sure I'm not giving in too easily. Thoughts?", "My girls are 3years and 3months.  \"M\" sat on the potty and went in twice but now will not.  \"S\" sits on the potty but does not go in it.  \\n\\nCurrently on day 2 of the underpants only weekend.  \"S\" has had 2 accidents but still not going in the potty.  We sit them on it first thing and have them in underpants all day.   Yesterday, M woke up around 730 and sat on the potty multiple times without going.  She held it until 1230 when we put a diaper on her for naptime and then went almost immediately.  These 5 hours she was up just holding it, not to mention her overnight diaper was dry.  So she held it all night through too noon and let it go as soon as we put a diaper on her on top of fluids.  Today seems to be the exact same thing as it is now noon and she still hasn't gone and had a dry diaper all night. \\n\\nMy wife and I are beyond frustrated right now...", "Our almost 3 year refuses to pee or poop in our potty at home. She has done it a few times at day care. We tried the \"oh crap\" method that ended in failure in 3 days. She held her pee for hours and waited until nap time to pee with or without a diaper. She is a surviving twin and was born 6 weeks early. Generally she is on track developmentally. She is tiny and waited until 18 months to walk. She seems to be a perfectionist and wants to be confident before she does anything. She also responds better to authority figures that aren't her parents which makes it tempting to hire someone to do it, although my husband is hesitant to take that approach. For now we are going to try to sit on the potty ever couple of hours. Any advice?", "We've been talking potty a lot lately with my 3 1/2 year old son. He does not want to use it, unless his 2 year old cousin uses it. He does do the potty dance (subconsciously it seems). But if I ask him if he has to go while he's doing a potty dance he will tell me no. If he starts to go in the tub he will stop and tell me he has to go. And he hides to go poop. \\nHe is in a preschool and his teacher says he goes there all the time so I don't know why he's not doing it here. I have tried bribing with candy, toys and even my phone. But unless I force him on the potty he will not go on his own accord.\\n\\nAny advice? I swear my 18 month old is going to learn before him.", "My four year old daughter finally is potty trained! I was expecting it to take months considering her fear and stubbornness leading up to it, but when she was ready it took a week or two. I'm still in awe when she poops on the potty. So have hope and don't stress! They will get there.", "She takes her diaper off at night and urinates all over her bed and in the morning she will pee on her floor. She is also refusing to pee on the potty during the day. Any suggestions on how I can get her excited about potty training?", "Started potty training a few days ago after making the switch to underwear instead of diapers (except at night). My friends say it's normal for my son to have poop accidents in his undies for a while and I just need to keep being patient.\\n\\nIs it also normal for a kid to prefer pooping in undies to pooping in the potty? He seems unconcerned about it.\\n\\nAgain, this has only been a few days. I'm trying to encourage him to poop in the potty, talking about how we're \"supposed to sit on the potty *before* pooping\" while I clean him up.\\n\\nI assume that he'll eventually have a success, but I'd love to know that all of this is perfectly normal and he'll get past it if I just keep doing like we're doing now. Potty breaks at regular intervals, change his clothes and clean him up when he has an accident, stickers and small rewards for successful potty visits, reading to him on the potty when I think he's gassy.", "What do you all do with small children when running errands and they need to use the bathroom. My son is close to being out of diapers but he's way too small to sit on a public full sized toilet. I don't want to undo my progress at home so I was wondering if you all had a good solution. He's just over a year. Thank you!", "My son was fully potty trained a few months ago. Through the night and everything. About a month or two ago he started having night accidents again. No big deal, I thought, just a regression. We just had our second, this is all normal.\\n\\nMy problem is, he is now having them every single night. We started him back in nighttime pullups to help but he is actually soaking through them. They weigh a ton by the time I get him up in the morning.\\n\\nNow I've got him going at least every two hours, all day. He drinks water or milk at breakfast, lunch and dinner and maybe a small glass of water at snack. We're talking maybe 1/2c of liquid at most at each sitting. Beyond dinner he is not allowed drinks to help with night time.\\n\\nSo how the heck is it possible for this little boy who drinks so little and potties so much during the day to have such an enormous amount of urine in him?! I'm getting nervous, I feel like there could be something medically wrong and will be calling the dr soon if I don't see reassuring answers.", "My son had been doing very well going to the bathroom any time he needed for almost a year now.  About a month ago though he just started pooping on himself several times a day, saying he forgot to go to the bathroom.  Is this normal?  How do we solve this?", "I am on day 3 of the \"three day potty training\" method with my son. He's done great...0 peepee accidents but he a) hold his poop until nap time when he wears a diaper or b) poops on the floor (one time). Should we continue with potty training? Tomorrow is the first day that we are supposed to put pants on him...now he is naked from the waist down. \\n\\nI don't want to give him a complex or anything about being scared to poop. When in diapers, he was very regular and had a bowel movement first thing in the morning, every morning. Now, he holds it. He says he is scared to go in the potty (we have both a potty seat adapter and a small \"froggy\" potty that sits on the floor).
