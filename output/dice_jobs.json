Our core strength is providing technical expertise and software development skills that directly affect the ability of our business to generate revenue and remain the dominant player in the market. We are committed to hiring the brightest and best technical experts and in return can offer roles with direct trading and quant interaction on projects from electronic and algorithmic trading to grid based computation of real-time risk metrics. \u00e5\u00ca About the role  We are looking to hire a software engineer to work in our Athena development team. Athena is the strategic risk, pricing, and trade management platform created at JP Morgan and is designed to enable rapid innovation. It is a Python based platform that offers Technologists, Quantitative Analysts and Risk Managers a cross-asset portfolio of models, frameworks and tools to use in building financial applications. Within Credit Technology, Athena is used extensively for Bond and CDS risk and analytics, whilst Reactive Athena (a realtime event processing framework) is used for algorithmic pricing and eTrading applications. The Athena development team is responsible for working with Trading and Quant Research to build out a range of components and core services focussed primarily on pricing, analytics, market making and real-time risk. The role will combine all aspects of software development from design and build to deployment, working within a team of experienced technologists.
