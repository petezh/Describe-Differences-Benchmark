- Framework for interaction between automation and labor markets
  - **Displacement effect** - robots replace workers in a way that decouples rises in output per worker from wages
  - Offset by **productivity effect** (expanded economy drives demand for nonautomated tasks) **capital accumulation** (need for capital to implement automation drives demand for labor), and **deepening of automation** (making existing workers more producitivty, without displacement)
  - Biggest offest is the **reinstatement effect** of new labor driven by the creation of new tasks altogether (e.g. annotators, AI researchers)
